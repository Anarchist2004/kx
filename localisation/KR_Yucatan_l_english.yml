YUC_high_command:0 "Yucatec High Command"
YUC_high_command_desc:0 "In Mérida's Municipal Palace, our highest-ranking officers have come together to plan a defence of our liberties. An eclectic mix of former revolutionaries, militias, Red Guardsman, and local volunteers give us a variety of experience to draw from."
YUC_barricades:0 "Mérida Barricades"

YUC_improve_equipment:0 "Improve Equipment"
YUC_improve_equipment_desc:0 "Our arsenal is mostly composed of leftover arms of the 1910 revolution, and whatever loyalists came to Yucatán with. It is worth it to purchase better gun designs, and prepare for a longer conflict after the emergency has ended."

YUC_star_war_desc:0 "To our forebearers, wars of great import oft seemed as though a star had shed its vitality upon the earth. As we focus on acquiring new long-range, some think that one day their violent journeys across the sky will impart a similar superstition in our enemies."

YUC_maya_code_desc:0 "The Maya's traditional system of seasonal conflict has been broken over the last century by the Mexican government's incursions. The lessons learned about avoiding the valleys in the summer were lost to the Cuidado Army, which we still retain."
YUC_modern_division_structure:0 "Modern Division Structure"

YUC_drill_the_natives_desc:0 "While the Mayan Rangers have worked swimmingly, the normal Mayan militias appear to treat the conflict with some indifference. We are a republic, and they are citizens, not a retinue. These soldiers should receive the same training as would a Mérida resident."
YUC_production_sites:0 "Production Sites"
YUC_production_sites_desc:0 "Clearing new land for production sites is a necessity, as usable land is at a premium in Yucatán."
YUC_naval_docks:0 "Naval Docks"
YUC_naval_docks_desc:0 "Our only access to the outside world, Progreso, has no modern naval facilities to speak of. A dockyard named after the remoteness of the city, Terminal Remota, has been constructed in order to break us out of the bubble."
YUC_protect_coasts:0 "Protecting Our Coast"

### Political Focuses ###
YUC_yucatec_democracy:0 "Yucatec Independence Secured"
YUC_yucatec_democracy_desc:0 "For the last seventy years, Yucatec have fought5 for democratic representation by the Cuidado. The imposition of Hispanidad and La Raza policies by the Sinarquistas that pushed us over the edge. We shall never submit to racialist dictators of any kind."

YUC_maya_victory:0 "Triumph of the Maya"
YUC_maya_victory_desc:0 "The rule of the Hispanic bastards has come to an end! The Maya people have rallied around General Francisco May Pech, and with a reinvigorated nativist spirit, they have pushed the Mexicans out of Yucatán and have declared that Maya civilization is not dead! Avenging the Caste War and calling for a new rebirth of Maya culture, language, society, Francisco May Pech shall punish the Spanish Colonizers and exact our revenge as we revive our repressed identity to old glories and beyond. "

YUC_ode_to_sacrafice:0 "Anti-Hispanicism"
YUC_ode_to_sacrafice_desc:0 "While many people in this great nation are of rightful Maya descent, others still speak the tongue of the Spaniards! This fact and the further existence of a distinct Spanish identity in our Yucatán is something that is simply unacceptable! Harsh laws against Spanish language and culture shall be implemented, for we shall reflect hundreds of years of oppression back at them."
YUC_remember_the_castle_war:0 "Remember the Caste War"
YUC_remember_the_castle_war_desc:0 "The Caste War of Yucatán officially lasted from 1847 to 1901, but our brave patriots and freedom fighters have kept the fight alive well into the 1930’s, never giving up the struggle and finally winning our Maya people their deserved independence after decades of fighting and centuries of oppression. Now, with our freedom secured and our new state being consolidated, it is time to honor the dead and remember their sacrifices, while also preparing for the inevitable return of war. War memorials and monuments shall be built around the nation, and funds will be created to compensate our fighters’ families and their widows, while simultaneously our state will build new bunkers at our borders and ammunition stores in our hinterlands to prepare for Europeans and their likely retaliation."
YUC_death_to_european_mexico:0 "Death to 'Latin' America"
YUC_death_to_european_mexico_desc:0 "The region we have lived in for millennia has come to be known as ‘Latin’ America - a stain on our land that both denies our existence and belittles our culture and impact on these lands. We must work to eradicate this foolish, Eurocentric label and restore our Mesoamerica to greatness. The era of a European-dominated Yucatán will come to an end, no matter the cost!"

YUC_chan_santa_cruz:0 "Chan Santa Cruz Avenged"
YUC_chan_santa_cruz_desc:0 "The old state of Chan Santa Cruz was the center of a syncretic religious movement that combined Maya culture with the Catholic faith while fighting for Maya independence on the Yucatán. Their short-lived fiefdom centered on our Eastern coast was the last independent indigenous Maya state to exist, finally dying out after the formal end of the Caste War in 1915. With the success of Francisco May Pech’s movement and with his formal proclamation upholding the ideas and tenets of the Cruzoobian state, it would seem that the fall of Chan Santa Cruz has finally been avenged. Long live the independent Maya people, long live Cruzoob!"
YUC_cruzoob_faith:0 "The Cruzoob Faith"
YUC_cruzoob_faith_desc:0 "The Cruzoob faith, also known as the Cult of the Talking Cross, is a syncretic religion mixing ancient Maya faith with Catholic tenets, forming a synthesis of European and Mesoamerican ideas entirely form-fitted to suit the spiritual needs of the modern Maya. Holding several old Maya texts, the Maya calendar, Maya chants and traditional music, herbalist tomes, and other aged facets of Maya spirituality in high regard, this faith revolves around the cosmic calendar, Christian morals, and a pantheon of Mesoamerican gods, with many being mixed with Christian figures and with the main god - K’u - being a mix of the Christian God and the old Maya god of creation. May Pech himself is an ardent believer in the faith, and now shall make all the Yucatán practice this one, true faith as well."
YUC_mayan_catholicism:0 "Total Maya-Catholic Syncretism"
YUC_mayan_catholicism_desc:0 "Taking the syncretism of the Cruzoob religion to a whole new level, May Pech has moved to fully combine the two faiths. Christian faith on its own has been banned, with only Cruzoob and other native faiths being allowed in the state. Furthermore, all Catholic Churches in the nation have been taken over and begun to be transformed into shrines for our many gods. More Christian tenets have been adopted and adapted to fit the needs and beliefs of our people, and the two religions have truly become one here in Yucatán. Under May Pech, this new fully unified faith shall be the glue that binds our nation and people together, and be the shield that protects us from the colonizers."
YUC_state_of_the_cross:0 "The State of the Talking Cross"
YUC_state_of_the_cross_desc:0 "Under Francisco May Pech, the Yucatán peninsula is finally safe. The Maya people and our culture have been safeguarded under our new syncretic faith, and the horrors of the Caste War and the fall of Chan Santa Cruz have been avenged. We are a state wholly dedicated to the Cult of the Talking Cross, and our devotion shall bring us salvation and prosperity. May Pech is our shepherd, and the Cruzoob faith is our guide. Forward now, into destiny!"

YUC_new_ajaw:0 "Elevating the New Ahau"
YUC_new_ajaw_desc:0 "The old Maya Civilization lasted for thousands of years, never centralizing but prospering until it finally collapsed under the Spanish in 1697 after centuries of decline, being lost to time as the Maya people were forced to integrate into Spanish-Mexican society. However, with the success of General Francisco May Pech, this late, great civilization can once again breathe life! A new noble class of lower ahau - or leaders - has been crowned, consisting of May Pech and his closest allies, as well as the most prominent figures in Yucatán that would swear loyalty to May Pech and this new state. These new ahau shall each lead a city or settlement, helping our new national father guide the nation on this path of total Maya restorationism."
YUC_mayan_pantheon:0 "Venerate the Maya Pantheon"
YUC_mayan_pantheon_desc:0 "The old gods of the Maya religion shall come to be re-venerated in our state, for we must prove we are the true children of Quetzalcoatl and the other gods. Our old pantheon shall rise, traditional offerings and sacrifices shall return, the old cosmic calendar shall be updated, and the old priesthood shall rise to lead our people. Many of our newly elevated Ahau shall be these new spiritual guides, with Francisco May Pech rising to become the high priest of the nation. We shall revive the faith of our ancestors and finally wipe away any and all European influence from our souls and from our identity."
YUC_revive_mayan_language:0 "Revive Maya Culture and Mayan Language"
YUC_revive_mayan_language_desc:0 "The original Maya Culture was thought to be lost for hundreds of years after our fall to the Spanish in the 1600s. For centuries before our resurgence, our culture and language rotted under Hispanicism. But now, as the Maya people rise from the mud and take the fate of their people and our Yucatán back into our grasp, our culture can flourish again! No longer shall the Spanish and the Mexicans and the fools of Central America sully the splendor of the Maya. Our culture shall be restored, our language proliferated, and our identity shall be reforged as May Pech guides us into a new golden age for the Maya!"
YUC_neo_maya:0 "A Restored Maya Civilization"
YUC_neo_maya_desc:0 "With Maya culture and religion spreading throughout Yucatán and with our restored Mayan language taking root, Maya civilization has truly returned to this Earth after being nearly eradicated by the Spanish. Now, Francisco May Pech has finally announced his ultimate ambition. Rising as the Kʼuhul Ahau - or ‘Divine Leader’ - and taking the regal name Kʼinich Janaab Pakal IV after the original Pakal the Great - the longest reigning monarch of the New World and the greatest Mayan Ahau and his descendents, Francisco May Pech is no more. Now, Pakal IV will reign as the Kʼuhul Ahau of our resurgent Maya state, hell bent on a path to create the first Maya Empire."

YUC_primitive_land:0 "Primitivist Land Usage"
YUC_primitive_land_desc:0 "Following principles started by our ancestors, we shall work the land just as they did - albeit using modern practices and technologies mixed with traditional methods and knowledge. Slash and burn agriculture, farming plot cycling, and jungle clearing for land development shall become key tools of the state to build up our new Maya civilization. Old Maya architecture will make a resurgence, and old crafts and practices utilized by the laborers and farmers among our ancestors will be utilized to their peak efficiency. We will perfect the methods of the past and build a new Maya state without losing sight of tradition."
YUC_agrarian_economics_natpop:0 "Maya Agrarianism"
YUC_agrarian_economics_natpop_desc:0 "Our resurgent Maya state will have an economy built around agriculture, for it is what we know best. By devoting large portions of the land to growing cash crops, we shall entice our friends across the Pacific and across the New World to buy our goods, and the rest of our arable land will go to food production and ranching to feed our growing populace. We will build a new, self-sufficient, and prosperous economy off the backs of our noble farmers, and we shall compensate and provide for these economic heroes, for our agricultural workers are the backbone of the nation."
YUC_anti_european_trade:0 "Anti-European Economics"
YUC_anti_european_trade_desc:0 "Though the West has opportune markets just begging for profit to be made, we cannot swallow our pride and trade with the colonizers. Instead, we shall look East across the Pacific and here on our own continent for trade partners and economic deals that truly put our needs first, or at least take our needs into account. By looking towards powers like Peru, Japan, Haiti, and others, we shall build our own stable and self-sufficient economy without having to turn tail and run back to the Spanish and their imperialist friends."

YUC_march_to_reclaim_our_people:0 "The March To Reclaim Our People"
YUC_march_to_reclaim_our_people_desc:0 "With Maya civilization restored and revitalized, the time has come to march to war. Across Mesoamerica, the various groups of Maya peoples wither under European and Hispanic oppression. We shall liberate these fellow children of Quetzalcoatl, bringing our empire one step closer to reality!"
YUC_reclaim_the_empire:0 "Unite the Maya People"
YUC_reclaim_the_empire_desc:0 "While Maya culture flourishes once more in our Yucatán, our brothers in the other lands across the former Maya civilization still chafe under the boot of European influence. We must rally our forces, and eventually move to strike at the Europeans and their lapdogs from Tabasco and Chiapas down to Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras, finally reclaiming the lost legacy of the Maya! However, for the first phase of our consolidation of the Maya people, we shall proceed to conquer the secondary homeland of our people - Guatemala and Belize! These territories hold the Quiché and Cakchiquel Maya and the Kekchi Maya respectively, and these long isolated splinters of the main Maya population must be liberated!"
YUC_reintergrate_the_empire:0 "Centralize the Old City States"
YUC_reintergrate_the_empire_desc:0 "Now that the old heartlands of the fallen Maya civilization of Yucatán have been reclaimed, we can begin the process of undoing the damages caused by the Europeans. The city states of our ancestors have finally been united under one banner for the first time in history, and now Francisco May Pech moves to centralize the power of these constituent city states away from their local appointed Ahau and into his own hands in order to build a strong and stable Maya state, and perhaps something more."
YUC_the_empire_breathes_again:0 "The Birth of the First Maya Empire"
YUC_the_empire_breathes_again_desc:0 "Our righteous and once-dead civilization has been reclaimed, with the old lands of the Maya from Mexico to Honduras and beyond within our grasp. For the first time in history, the Maya people have been united under one banner - a banner of their own, and not of some colonizing power. We have finally restored the legacy of Pakal the Great and the original Maya civilization, and now, under Kʼuhul Ahau Kʼinich Janaab Pakal IV, the first Maya Empire shall rise from the ashes of colonialism and imperialist oppression. Long live the Maya, long live Pakal IV!"
YUC_wipe_out_european_mexico:0 "Wipe Out European Mexico"
YUC_wipe_out_european_mexico_desc:0 "Mesoamerica has been struck by and infected with a virulent disease. The centerpiece of this European-derived plague is the foul wasteland that is Mexico, where these foul Hispanics lord over our Tzotzil and Tzeltal brothers who live in the highlands of Chiapas and Tabasco. From the time of the Mexica and Aztec Empire to the modern day, we have warred with the inhabitants of Mexico City. It is finally time to put this centuries-old struggle to an end. We march to Tenochtitlan to restore a truly native Mesoamerica!"
YUC_flower_wars:0 "The New Flower Wars"
YUC_flower_wars_desc:0 "To the South lies the lands of Central America - the old stomping ground of the Maya people. This blood bowl is where we used to wage our flower wars - wars fought between city states, settlements, and tribes in order to maintain the balance of power between Mesoamerican civilization while also gathering slaves for use in ritual sacrifices and for labor. We shall restart this tradition, marching into Central America in order to tame these wild lands and to bring about a new era of internal flower wars to expand our empire and to rejuvenate our culture."
YUC_join_co_prosperity_sphere:0 "Join the Co-Prosperity Sphere"
YUC_join_co_prosperity_sphere_desc:0 "Far to the East lies one of the greatest non-Western powers on Earth - the Empire of Japan. Fiercely anti-European and determined to build their own place in the sun free from Western entanglement, they would be the perfect ally for our fledgling state. We shall reach out to the Land of the Rising Sun with diplomatic overtures and gifts in order to win over the Emperor and his government so that we may be allowed into the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Together, we shall fight Western and European influence wherever it may spring up."

From within this dense hive of bunkers, trenches, tunnels, and thicket, we shall hold out and defend our Yucatán against any and every foe.

The protections on labor were extended to cover domestic workers.[17] Because he felt that vice was particularly hard on women and families, a series of acts outlawing bullfights, drinking, gambling, lotteries and raffles were passed.[28] Alvarado's prohibition law was one of the most restrictive in Mexico and even made drunkenness sufficient grounds for divorce.[29] He did not pass laws criminalizing prostitution, but instead required regular health inspections for prostitutes.
