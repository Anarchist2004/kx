### Leaders ###
POLITICS_MICHAEL_COLLINS_DESC:0 "Michael Collins is the saviour and national hero of Ireland, with wide scale popularity keeping him in power. Born in Cork, Collins fought in the 1916 Easter Rising and afterwards became the president of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. During the war he organised the IRA into an effective guerrilla force, seeking to avoid the mistakes of 1916. In 1921 he was sent to negotiate the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Although by threatening to continue the war with German backing he was able to acquire all thirty-two counties in the treaty, he was unable to secure a republic, with the British fearing that an independent Irish republic would immediately become a German base. When he was expelled from Sinn Féin by Éamon de Valera he managed to form his own party, Fine Gael, which quickly overtook Sinn Féin in popularity. After the British Revolution he declared an independent Republic of Ireland and defeated a Unionist uprising in Ulster. Now with the Second Weltkrieg approaching Collins advocates revitalising Ireland's economy and military in order to assert Ireland's independence."
POLITICS_CATHAL_BRUGHA_DESC:0 "Born Charles William St. John Burgess of mixed Catholic and Protestant heritage, and later changing his name after joining the Gaelic League, Cathal Brugha is a war hero from the Easter Rising and leader of the rump Sinn Féin following the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He, already being a staunch rival of Collins during the War of Independence, became leader of the democratic opposition, a coalition of democratic parties opposing Collins, although he has increasingly become a figurehead to rally around in his old age as a new generation rises in the Republican movement. He and his party, bolstered in strength by many ex-Labourites following the 1923 ban after Larkin's failed uprising, advocate a social democratic Ireland as per the Democratic Programme of 1919, and a pro-German alignment to oppose Ireland's enemies in Britain and Canada."
POLITICS_FRANK_MACDERMOT_DESC:0 "Frank MacDermot is the youngest son of Hugh O'Rorke MacDermot, the Prince of Coolavin. He served in the Royal Army Service Corps during the Weltkrieg. Afterwards, he emigrated to America only to return to Ireland after the American economic collapse, and joined the anglophile National Centre Party, eventually becoming its leader due to his great oratory skills. A persistent critic of both the Collins' government and the democratic opposition's sympathies towards isolationism or Germanophilia, he is a strong advocate of a pro-Entente policy and rapprochement with the Unionist community."
POLITICS_JIM_LARKIN_DESC:0 "James Larkin, born in England before moving with his family to Ireland grew up in poverty and became a trade union organiser and formed the Labour Party with James Connolly, most famously participating in the failed Dublin Lockout of 1913. After the failure of the lockout, he moved to America and became a member of the Socialist Party of America. Upon his return to Ireland in 1923 he received a hero's welcome from Irish syndicalists and took control of the Labour Party, hoping to launch a syndicalist rising as in France over disappointments with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The rising was a failure with informers revealing the plans of the ICA rebels beforehand and the Labour Party was banned, leading Larkin to go into hiding with the help of the Commune of France. The Irish Citizen Army suffered dear for their loyalty, with their role in the Easter Rising being erased from the official history and their founder James Connolly's role downplayed."
POLITICS_GEAROID_O_CUINNEAGAIN_DESC:0 "Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin is a radical Irish language scholar, born in Belfast to a middle-class Catholic family, he joined the Army Comrades Association and managed to work his way up to Minister for Justice of Ireland as a result of his charisma, leadership and radical ideas which attracted the interest of ACA leader Eoin O'Duffy. As Minister for Justice, he passed laws repressing syndicalism as well as anti-traveler settlement laws against the Pavee community, as well as using his influence to encourage the Irish language. He also maintained links with the Romanian Iron Guard, expressing sympathy for establishing a similar regime in Ireland. To this end, he formed his own party Ailtirí na hAiséirghe that would revive the Irish language, ban the English language after a period of five years, and establish strong anti-syndicalist and anti-Semitic policies."
POLITICS_PADRAIC_O_MAILLE_DESC:0 "Pádraic Ó Máille was one of the founding members of Sinn Féin and a member of the Irish volunteers, and leader of the radically Catholic and anti-syndicalist Irish Christian Front, supporting Catholic corporatism and an alliance with the Spanish Carlists. As a result of his anti-syndicalist views, he almost fell victim to an assassination attempt by the ICA in 1932, but managed to survive despite being badly wounded."
POLITICS_SEAN_LEMASS_DESC:0 "Seán Lemass was a volunteer during the Easter Rising and War of Independence and rose to become the head of the CPNH party, another breakaway party following the decline of Sinn Féin following the Anglo-Irish treaty. Lemass is an advocate for industrialisation and while he is a believer in capitalism, he also believes that normalising relations with the Union of Britain could have a beneficial effect on Irish trade and the economy. He is in favour of a flexible Irish foreign policy depending on the nation's needs, contrasting the CPNH from the other democratic parties who have their own biases in regards to Irish foreign policy."
POLITICS_DE_VALERA_DESC:0 "Eamon de Valera, born in New York to a Spanish father and Irish mother and taken to Ireland at the age of two, was a commander in the Easter Rising and a political leader during the War of Independence, however ending up slipping into political irrelevancy due to some poor political moves and misfortune following the Anglo-Irish treaty, having expelled Michael Collins from the Sinn Féin party despite Collins' incredible popularity, and then left SF himself later due to the influx of ex-Labourites into the party after the 1923 ban of the Labour Party as well as disputes with nationalists preferring a pro-German alignment which were in contrast with de Valera's belief in isolationism and neutrality. His breakaway party, Fianna Fáil, ultimately failed to be a success, becoming a minor party in the democratic opposition..."

IRE_Ulster_Issue_desc: "The territory of Ulster has been occupied by the Republic of Ireland ever since the British fell to revolution; and while we have tried to incorporate them into Ireland proper, they have not gone quietly. The status of Ulster remains contentious in the Irish political scene, and a permanent solution to the Ulster issue is needed if the Emerald Isle is to remain free from armed civil conflict."
IRE_Unraveling_Political_Scene: "Unraveling Political Scene"
IRE_Unraveling_Political_Scene_desc: "Fine Gael has enjoyed an almost unopposed hold on Ireland's democratic political system ever since the foundation of the free republic, but that has begun to change in recent years. Collins' old adversary Éamon de Valera has been steadily gaining more power within Ireland as the economic situation worsens under Collins' rule; and as Fine Gael's power wanes, violent clashes between supporters of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have become more common. This swell in political violence has led to a significant increase in Sinn Féin’s popularity as Cathal Brugha’s ideas gain more traction with the masses, branding themselves as a peaceful third way between de Valera and Collins. Additionally, Socialists of various ilks have been steadily clawing their way into political relevance, largely thanks to support from the Union of Britain and the American SPA. With all this in mind, the election of 1937 is set to be the most contentious one in recent memory, and if Fine Gael is to remain in their position of unchecked dominance,they will need to prove to the people of Ireland of their commitment to overhauling Ireland's stagnant economic and political scenes in order to end the Troubles once and for all. "
IRE_Threat_Across_Isle: "The Threat Across the Isle"
IRE_Threat_Across_Isle_desc: "Many hoped the British Revolution would have marked the end of British Imperialism in Ireland. However, the new Syndicalist government in London has largely proven to be no different than the old Royalists on the matter of wanting to control Irish Affairs. We once thought that Imperialism was only a symptom of Britain's monarchist system, but as the Syndicalists continue to continue all the old royalist tricks, we have now come to the inescapable conclusion that the desire to subjugate our Emerald Isle is simply within the Englishmen's blood, leading many to be convinced that our rivalry with London will only end when Brittania has been wiped off of the face of the earth for good."

IRE_ARD_desc:0 "The rural areas of Ireland are by far the most neglected by the government to date, and could easily serve as a starting point for radical economic improvement.

ire.59.d:0 "We have left our rural areas in a state of backwards insignificance for far too long. It is time that we do something. Ireland is moving forward, and so too must her rural communities. Much of our industry has traditionally relied upon agriculture, but times have changed. If we want to keep agriculture as a vital part of our economy, then we need to upgrade our farming facilities. Similarly, much of Ireland's road systems are in a state of complete disrepair, and currently the responsibility for repair work of any kind falls to private enterprise. Our transport network in general could be considerably improved, allowing us to move both people and economic goods around the country at a more rapid rate. This situation calls for obvious economic expenditure, but we must keep the national debt in mind. More radical changes will encourage the population that we are serious about dealing with the issue, however."

Ireland has long been seen as a rural backwater by other world powers, a place that progress seemed to leave behind. Whilst a cruel opinion, it is not without truth. Centuries of British rule left Ireland largely neglected whilst the rest of the world raced on. It's time to catch up. The ESIC will be composed of expert scientists recruited from both the Irish population and from friendly foreign allies.

IRE_Promote_Irish_Language: "Promote Traditional Celtic Revivalism"
IRE_Promote_Irish_Language_desc: "Once a member of the Irish-language promoting social and cultural organization called the Conradh na Gaeilge, or the Gaelic League, before breaking off to form his own Pan-Celtic nationalist group called the Craobh na hAiséirghe which later evolved into our current party, Ó Cuinneagáin has risen to become the face of Celtic nationalism and Gaelic Revivalism. Calling for a resurgence of the Irish language and of traditional Celtic culture and clan identities, the eventual prohibition of English once the populace fully adapts to this new idea of a wholly Irish Ireland, pro-natalist policies to expand the Celtic population, and a ban on Irish emigration, the Ceannaire Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin will make Ireland truly and only Celtic again. By working with the Pan-Celtic woman’s group Cumann na Saoirse along with nationalist and Pan-Celtic movements in Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Mann, and Brittany, the Ceannaire will ensure that the Pan-Celtic dream and this Gàidhlig Athbhreith, or Gaeilic Renaissance, shall flourish and spread prosperity and honor for all true children of Celtica."
IRE_Irish_Corporatism: "Open Christian Corporatism for Ireland"
IRE_Irish_Corporatism_desc: "Embracing the ideas of Corporatism and class cooperation,  Ceannaire Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin has pushed ahead with his plan to transform Ireland into a Christian and Corporatist dictatorial republic under himself and God above. An oddity among the Irish Right, Ó Cuinneagáin is not against Protestants, embracing both them and Catholics so long as they swear loyalty to our state and our identity over any foreign group or figure, and as such, these unitarian Christian beliefs shall become the foundation of our pious corporatism. Material poisons and viruses such as Capitalism and Socialism shall be rejected and removed from the apparatus of state, and the classes shall live and work together in harmony to create a new economy and financial system that supports all true children of Ireland without falling prey to predatory ideologies and misguided Leftist populism."
IRE_Legion_Ties: "March Alongside the Blueshirts"
IRE_Legion_Ties_desc: "The Blueshirts of O’Duffy may not be members of the Architects of the Resurrection, but they share many similar ideas to our movement, with Ceannaire Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin even serving in their militia as a youth. We shall allow the Blueshirts to continue on about their business, but as an official arm of the state and part of the Party, and on a tight leash to avoid unnecessary bloodshed and backlash, and with their anti-Protestant attitudes in check. Together, we shall build a safe, strong, and deeply pious Ireland truly in tune with our traditionalist roots."
IRE_English_Crackdown: "Crackdown Against the Anglos"
IRE_English_Crackdown_desc: "The Anglo-Saxon, or English, culture can barely be called a culture at all, for they are no more than a wretched conglomeration of thieves, tyrants, vultures, and parasites. In their long history, they have been nothing but mutts and conquerors, subjugating lands to spread their wretched and misshapen identity as they steal the cultural creations and genius of other groups, all to overcompensate for their own pathetic and bacteria-like existence. We must cleanse Ireland of this failed group and their vile taint so that our Emerald Isle can finally be free and truly, wholly Celtic once again. We shall move to slowly limit the usage of the English language until it has been entirely eradicated from the local vernacular, and laws shall be passed to limit the rights and privileges of any Anglos foolish enough to stay on our Island. We will purify Celtica and end the centuries of subjugation these foul dogs have wrought upon us, for here and now dawns the Age of the Celtic Resurrection!"
IRE_New_Deal: "An Margadh Nua"
IRE_New_Deal_desc: "Meaning ‘the New Market’, An Margadh Nua is the economic plan envisioned by Ceannaire Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin that hinges around Right-populism and heavily regulated anti-Capitalist markets in order to alleviate the plight of the Irish common-man while emphasizing class cooperation as opposed to class conflict. This new deal for the Irish people, inspired by the works of American Progressives such as La Guardia, Teddy Roosevelt, and the late FDR along with the economic works of Mussolini and others, all adapted to fit our Right-wing attitudes, shall provide a safe, fair, and prosperous economy for all Irishmen to enjoy and revel in, all without fears of drifting to the perfidious Left."
IRE_Military_Build_Up: "Militarize and Fortify the Isle"
IRE_Military_Build_Up_desc: "If Ireland is to be safe and secure, we will have to militarize the nation on a massive scale while fortifying every beachhead and port of ingress, for our foes will not wait long before they strike at us once again. New factories and industrial centers shall rise to plume the smog of progress and modernity into the air while we expand our armed forces and fortify every square kilometer of our Emerald Isle. We shall not fall!"
IRE_Ireland_Strong_And_Free: "Éire Strong and Free"
IRE_Ireland_Strong_And_Free_desc: "Under Ceannaire Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin and the Ailtirí na hAiséirghe, we have initiated a Celtic Renaissance and an Irish resurgence, for Éire stands strong and free in defiance of our foes and the fate of subjugation that so many deemed inescapable. Never again shall we bend the knee to foreign conquerors, for the revived Pan-Celtic identity and our prosperous mixed economy now carries us towards prosperity and progress! Under the Ceannaire and under God, Ireland shall never falter, for our corporatist paradise and the spirit of the Celtic people will endure forevermore!"

IRE_Blueshirts: "Our Isle Under the Blueshirts"
IRE_Blueshirts_desc: "Eoin O’Duffy and his Blueshirts, formally called the Army Comrades Association, have risen to save our united Irish republic from the dangers of radical Socialism and Liberalism, and from the compromised and soft vision of Michael Collins and Fine Gael. With his agrarian biases and devotion to Catholicism, O’Duffy shall guide the people of the Emerald Isle under his iron fist as he builds a strong, conservative, and pious Ireland centered around his National Corporate Party, championing the ideas of the Easter Rising movement and the republican dream birthed in that baptism of fire and bloodshed. Now, supported by his ideas of Clerical National Authoritarianism, Agrarian Corporatism, Gaelic Revivalism, Irish Nationalism, Catholic Populism, and Anti-Leftism, Mharascail, or Marshal, O’Duffy will make the dream of a strong and independent, wholly Irish Ireland a reality."
IRE_Honour_Collins: "Honor Collins"
IRE_Honour_Collins_desc: "Though Micheal Collins may not have had the guts to do what must be done to secure Ireland like Mharascail O’Duffy has, ultimately paying the final price for it, he was still a hero of Irish independence and one of the most famed figures in modern Irish history. While serving as one of the most successful rebel leaders of the IRA, Collins stood as a guiding beacon that helped lit our way through The Troubles and towards true but cautious freedom before his untimely and violent demise. We shall honor Collins and all he endured and sacrificed during his time as a freedom fighter and great negotiator, granting him the respect he deserves while also solidifying his legacy as a proud and honorable, but permanently retired relic of the past that ultimately failed where our Blueshirts have now triumphed. Carving off our rough edges and dusting them under the rug of Collins’ tremendous reputation, we will ensure that our interpretation of the republican Irish dream can truly come to fruition while using the image of the fallen Big Fellow to uphold our new regime and our standing in the eyes of the masses."
IRE_Maintain_Social_Order: "Restore Societal Order"
IRE_Maintain_Social_Order_desc: "The very fabric and well-being of Irish society has deteriorated in recent years as our nation tries to tear itself apart at the seams under the pressures of radical extremism, Socialism, Liberalism, and foreign or other subversive influences. We must restore this deteriorating fabric while ensuring that a sense of true law, order, and justice is ushered in with this new era of order and peace. Under O’Duffy and the Army Comrades Association, Ireland shall be healed and made orderly and obedient once again, for the good of all Irishmen and for the good of all Ireland."
IRE_Oppose_Syndicalism: "Defang the Red Dogs"
IRE_Oppose_Syndicalism_desc: "We shall oppose Syndicalism and all its vile alternate forms, for nothing is less Irish than following the predatory ideology of the perfidious Anglo menace. All Leftist political parties and other similar organizations shall be outlawed, their members and known associates put on government watch-lists, and their activities closely monitored by our growing police force and by Blueshirt militias, facing the penalty of law if any should step out of line. The Emerald Isle shall be cleansed and purified for the good of all true Irishmen as we defang the Red Dogs once and for all."
IRE_Organize_Public_Service: "Public Service Reorganization"
IRE_Organize_Public_Service_desc: "The apparatus of state has decayed, endlessly assailed by Crypto-Syndicalist and Liberal radicalisms thinly-veiled as reforms and populism. We will need a new civil service and bureaucracy entirely distinct from and untainted by these naive ideological viruses that have infected our beloved Emerald Isle. From the smallest local government and clan organization to the halls of the Oireachtas itself and our own police force, every aspect of our administration shall be cleansed, reorganized, and re-staffed in order to ensure all public services and government institutions are loyal, well-functioning, and firmly in our control at the end of our leash."
IRE_Christian_Ireland: "A Purely Catholic Ireland"
IRE_Christian_Ireland_desc: "Mharascail O’Duffy and his militiamen in the IRA and the Blueshirts made a name for themselves early in our fight for freedom as prominent pro-Catholic zealots and anti-Protestant patriots. Raiding Protestant homes and storefronts for weapons and supplies while allowing the occasional slaughter of resistant Protestant traitors and apparent pro-Anglo agents, these pious Catholics have brought these attitudes to Ireland on a national level. Catholicism shall be the only religion accepted in our Ireland, and all shall follow the one true faith, or otherwise will keep their true beliefs to themselves if they know what is good for them, for our island will not be subjected to dangerous, traitorous, and heretical Protestant sectarianism ever again."
IRE_Organize_Employers: "Organize the Employers"
IRE_Organize_Employers_desc: "As the O’Duffy regime works to retool the economy to fit our new Catholic Corporatist direction, a major hurdle has arisen in how to go about the shift from predatory and unhinged Capitalism towards our more beneficial, stable, and prosperous economic model. The employers of the nation, including the managerial class, and all other cogs of the Capitalist machine shall be reeducated and reorganized in order to create a far more fair economic and profitable financial system that benefits all true Irishmen as opposed to a select group of elitist beneficiaries. By removing any lasting influence of both Capitalism and Socialism from the economy, we shall construct a more equal yet authoritarian Corporatist state built around class cooperation, trade protectionism, and nation-wide economic parity so that all loyal sons and daughters of Éire can truly prosper, all without falling to dangerous and predatory radicalism."
IRE_Organize_Farmers: "Organize the Farmers"
IRE_Organize_Farmers_desc: "A farmboy himself as a youth growing up in an impoverished smallholder family, O’Duffy has always held a soft spot for Agrarian pursuits. A proponent of more modern and efficient tillage farming as opposed to traditionalist pasture farming, which drove a wedge between himself and his former Sinn Féin allies, O’Duffy has begun to orchestrate Ireland’s own agricultural revolution. With modernized and mechanized Agrarianism supporting the new Corporatist economic structure, paired with protectionist trade policies and new legislation and reserve funds for our farmers, Ireland’s fields and fens shall be turned into the most lush and fertile farm plots we can muster, reawakening our agrarian traditions while creating a modern agriculturally-based economy that both feeds and enrichens the masses as we make the Emerald Isle truly green."
IRE_Awaken_Ireland: "Awaken the Emerald Isle"
IRE_Awaken_Ireland_desc: "Ireland nearly collapsed into radicalism under the rotting structure of our old democracy, but all that calamity was avoided thanks to the intervention of the Blueshirts and the resurgence of Irish Nationalism. By the hand of the Mharascail Eoin O’Duffy, the old wretched Liberal and Crypto-Syndicalist regime has been torn down, replaced with a new Catholic Corporatist state apparatus that supports Ireland’s one true faith and her loyal patriots. The Emerald Isle shall now prosper strong and free forevermore, fully awoken to our natural and pious destiny by the new administration, and all guided by O’Duffy’s genius vision and by God’s holy light."

IRE_Democratic_Mandate_desc: "Irish democracy has been preserved, and despite these hard times, the goals of the Easter Rising shall not falter! The original dream of a Democratic Irish Republic shall continue on as new elections are prepared, with the major parties of the Oireachtas all being in the running, such as Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, the National Centre Party, and the returning incumbents from Fine Gael. We have given the people of Ireland their voices again, so now let those voices finally be heard!"

IRE_Valera: "Fianna Fáil Victory"
IRE_Valera_desc: "Fianna Fáil, literally meaning the ‘Soldiers of Destiny’ or the ‘Warriors of Fáil’, have come out victorious in the recent democratic elections. Known as the Republican Party of Ireland, these conservative Christian Democrats adhere closely to the ideas espoused by Irish national father and Fianna Fáil founder Éamon de Valera, pushing for Center-Right populism, non-radical Irish nationalism, Gaelic conservatism, and Christian piety. Under these populist conservatives, Ireland shall heal and prosper as one nation, one republic, and one people under God."
IRE_Christian_Democracy: "True Christian Democracy"
IRE_Christian_Democracy_desc: "Fianna Fáil has always prided itself on the pursuit of a good and holy, Christian and pious Irish democracy. With de Valera and his clique of Catholic democrats finally at the helm, Ireland shall once again march along under the light of the Lord, promoting Catholic morals and sensibilities as a fair and untampered conservative democratic system is established in order to give power to the voices to the masses."
IRE_Cultural_Conservatism: "Cultural Conservatism"
IRE_Cultural_Conservatism_desc: "Ireland is a Conservative nation at heart, wary to drastic change and deeply tied to centuries-old traditions and ideas. This legacy of cultural conservatism tied to the Catholic faith and to Celtic traditions shall not only be safeguarded and upheld, but also expanded and promoted throughout the state, ensuring that Irish Conservatism remains the dominant thoughtform among the people for generations to come."
IRE_New_Constitution: "A New Constitution"
IRE_New_Constitution_desc: "Deciding to distance ourselves from the original Constitution of the Irish Free State established in 1922, de Valera and Fianna Fáil have decided to draft a new Constitution of Ireland, or the Bunreacht na hÉireann. Asserting the national sovereignty of the Irish people, this document will become the foundation of our reformed democratic system, enshrining traditions of Conservative Democracy and Catholic Traditionalism while guaranteeing certain fundamental rights, the existence and power of our bicameral legislature the Oireachtas, the separation of powers between branches of the government balanced with checks, and judicial independence and review. By this document, we shall build a stronger and more unified Irish democracy."
IRE_Irish_Soverignty: "Cement Irish Sovereignty"
IRE_Irish_Soverignty_desc: "One of the main pillars of the Fianna Fáil platform is the establishment of a wholly independent and sovereign Irish state supported by modern and non-radical notions of Irish Nationalism and Catholic pride along with Gaelic language revivalism and anti-Anglo reform. With these unified positions in mind, we shall slowly march to build a fully Irish Emerald Isle, detached from the dark shadow of the Troubles and from English identities, and with the best intentions in mind for the Irish people and the Irish people alone."
IRE_Special_Status_Church: "A Special Status for the Church"
IRE_Special_Status_Church_desc: "The Catholic Church has always held a special and lofty position within Irish society, sometimes reigning as the most influential organization within the state over the government or the English imperialists themselves. Ever the staunch ally and the foundational body that supports our faith and our Conservative Traditionalism, we shall grant the Catholic Church and its subsidies a special status within the state, eroding the idea of secularism without fully breaking it, and ensuring that our beloved Church remains closely tied to the functions and developments of the state for ages to come."
IRE_Fiscal_Conservatism: "Classical Fiscal Liberalism"
IRE_Fiscal_Conservatism_desc: "Though the Americans have muddied the term ‘Liberalism’ and conflated it with progressive, semi-Socialist and welfare based practices, we here in Europe know the true meaning. We shall pursue a policy of Fiscal Classical Liberalism, advocating for tax-cuts, reduced government spending, free markets, financial deregulation, privatization, free and open trade, and an attempt at limiting government debt over all other economic goals. We will build a strong and self-standing economy linked with the wider Capitalist world, bringing about the end of Irish economic stagnace as we rise to the global financial stage."
IRE_Smear_Collins: "Tarnish Collins’ Legacy"
IRE_Smear_Collins_desc: "Though a renowned freedom fighter with the IRA and a well-respected orator, negotiator, and politician, Collins was always a wolf in sheep’s clothing. A potential tyrant and unabashed strongman lying in wait, he has ever plotted to wrap Ireland within the palm of his hands despite his otherwise noble notions of creating an independent Ireland. We must reveal the varied truth of Collins’ grey reality, showing the masses the true man behind the mask as we further uphold the real hero of Irish independence, our own de Valera."
IRE_A_Conservative_Ireland: "A Conservative Ireland Under God"
IRE_A_Conservative_Ireland_desc: "By the will of the Father of Irish Conservatism and his allies in Fianna Fáil, the Emerald Isles have once again been wrapped in the safe and prosperous arms of Catholic morality and modernized traditionalism. By the will of Éamon de Valera, non-Liberal and anti-Socialist Catholic populism has risen to support the masses as measured Capitalism and Catholic morals breathe life into our once-stagnating socio-economic reality. Under God and under de Valera’s Fianna Fáil, the reborn Irish nation shall stand proud, pious, and strong against corruptive and sinful outside forces, blazing a path towards prosperity for all true children of Éire guided by the glorious light of the Lord."

IRE_Collins_Democracy: "Fine Gael Re-Elected"
IRE_Collins_Democracy_desc: "Fine Gael, or the ‘Family of the Irish’, has secured yet another win for themselves, once again rising to the top of Irish democracy as the champions of a United Ireland. Practicing Liberal Conservatism and espousing Christian Democracy, Fine Gael has always preached a pragmatic, non-ideologically constrained approach to serving the masses, stating that their way is the right way for Ireland, regardless of dogma or ideology. Headed by former-freedom fighter turned national father Michael Collins, Fine Gael shall guide Irish democracy towards a mediated and pragmatic center partyline while supporting the masses and paying respect to our history and traditions."
IRE_Use_Collins_Popularity: "Collins’ Useful Heroism"
IRE_Use_Collins_Popularity_desc: "No single modern man or figure stands higher than Michael Collins, for millions across Ireland hold this freedom fighter and father of Irish independence in the highest regard. Though this pseudo-cult of personality has its dangers, the potential usefulness far outweighs the minor risks it holds as we inflate the Big Fellow’s power and ego. Fine Gael shall utilize Collins’ popularity and unmatched position in Irish culture and politics in order to ensure that our party and our platform is as widely beloved and followed as Collins is."
IRE_Old_Dog_New_Tricks: "Old Dog, New Tricks"
IRE_Old_Dog_New_Tricks_desc: "Collins has been in power for quite a long time, ruling the free and independent Irish Republic for roughly a decade since our rise to freedom in the wake of the British Revolution and defeated Unionist Uprising in Ulster. Though he has done much to create a prosperous and free Ireland, the state has stagnated in recent years as the German economy began to slump, and many fear that Collins now merely stands as a fallen hero living on the good graces of his past achievements, but that shall not become a reality! Collins has endeavored to not just coast on his old popularity as a war hero and founder of the Irish Republic and Fine Gael itself, instead beginning a new series of reforms and legislations aimed at breathing life into the economy and wider society once more. This old dog shall learn new tricks in order to solidify his legacy as the greatest Irish statesman of the modern age as the Emerald Isle is guided towards prosperous modernity under Fine Gael."
IRE_Hands_Across_The_Isle: "Hands Across the Isle"
IRE_Hands_Across_The_Isle_desc: "If Ireland is to survive the coming tumult, the government of our Emerald Isle must be united like never before. Fools like de Valera have only sought to sow division as they push for their uncompromising Christian Conservative vision, but this shall not be allowed! Using non-radical notions of Irish Nationalism with non-partisan populism and other universally liked positions, Fine Gael shall unite the disparate political masses of our island against the coming maelstrom. We must work with our fellow anti-de Valera rivals across the aisle and all true Irish statesmen across the Isle if we are to create a strong, pious, and prosperous Irish Republic for all, for we cannot unite the masses if our own government is in factionalist shambles."
IRE_The_Threat_To_The_East: "The Eastern Villain Looms"
IRE_The_Threat_To_The_East_desc: "To the East, the one true enemy of the Irish people waits, ever-plotting for our downfall and subjugation just as they have for hundreds upon hundreds of years. The Anglo-Saxon menace of England can never be trusted, for even despite Collins’ expert skills as a negotiator and diplomat, the foul English denied our demand for home rule and the creation of the Irish Free State all those years ago. Luckily for us, their own hubris led to their downfall, for the British Revolution turned their empire to ash and gave freedom to the Irish people at long last, but that does not mean we are safe. Under new banners and now puppets of the Red Star of Syndicalism, the English wolves may wear new coats, but these rabid dogs still are up to their same old tricks. We must never lower our guard against the Angloid menace, for we shall never allow another Time of Troubles ever again!"
IRE_Pragmatic_Liberalism: "Pragmatic Liberalism"
IRE_Pragmatic_Liberalism_desc: "The Liberalism of Fine Gael is far from the decadent and perverse idea of ‘Liberalism’ as spawned by the faltering Continentals and Americans or their ideological allies, for Collins and our united Ireland stand strong by the ideas of true Liberalism and the Enlightenment. Conservative by the standards of some, we walk the truth path to a Liberal and Republican society, free from the vices and dangers of stagnant Traditionalism and overly-cautious Conservatism, or from predatory Socialism and naive Progressivism, and ever pragmatic as to deduce the most correct path forward for our society at any one moment. This true incarnation of Liberal Capitalism shall form the foundation of the state, ensuring that Ireland always walks the path best suited for it, now and forever."
IRE_Irish_Unity: "United by Irish Nationalism"
IRE_Irish_Unity_desc: "Though often tainted by radicalism and ideology, Nationalism itself is not an inherently dangerous or harmful idea; in fact, it is these notions of non-radical Irish Nationalism that is the basis of Fine Gael’s foundations. By spreading these ideas of nonviolent patriotism and national loyalty to the masses while revitalizing our local Gaelic culture and language, we shall work to unite the Irish people like never before. Though we shall face difficult resistance in parts of the nation, particularly around Ulster due to the Unionists, Fine Gael shall persevere in order to promote nationwide Irish Unity, for this union shall form the bulwark against the corrosive foreign elements that seek to subjugate and weaken the Irish people."
IRE_Defend_Democracy: "Defenders of the Emerald Isle"
IRE_Defend_Democracy_desc: "Ireland for the Irish! That is the dream we uphold and maintain, for Fine Gael is the sword and shield of the Emerald Isle that Collins and his loyalists wield against anti-Irish forces and the Anglo-Saxon plague. Using controlled militarism, a renewed industrial and urban-focused economy, and the devotion of the masses, we shall defend Ireland and our liberal democratic republic against all those who would seek to undermine our platform. No Syndicalist swine or Reactionary wretch shall lay a finger on the gingered hair of our beloved masses, for Ireland stands strong and free, forever."
IRE_Democracy_Under_The_Big_Fellow: "Democracy Under the 'Big Fellow'"
IRE_Democracy_Under_The_Big_Fellow_desc: "Under the Big Fellow Michael Collins, Ireland has run the gauntlet of independence, prevented Syndicalism from spreading from English shores, stopped the Unionist threat, united the Emerald Isles, and ushered in true democratic republicanism for the masses, supported by Christian Conservative Liberalism, Irish Nationalism, and regulated Capitalism. Once just a warrior and diplomat, the Big Fellow now stands as the uncontested master statesman of Ireland, and in the eyes of some he stands as the greatest Irishman of the modern age. Our beautiful and verdant island breathes strong and free, prosperous and pious as it is guided by the brilliance of Fine Gael, and we owe it all to the Big Fellow."

IRE_National_Center: "National Centre Victory"
IRE_National_Center_desc: "In a shocking turn of events, the relatively small National Centre Party has seized control of Irish democracy by mandate of the masses. Formerly known as the National Farmers and Ratepayers League, at first glance the NCP seems to hold many similarities to their hated rivals in Fianna Fáil. However, where they differ truly matters, with the NCP pushing for Agrarianism and pro-farmer agricultural reform, Christian Conservatism, moderated Irish nationalism and patriotism, and most differentiating of all, a detente with our former Anglo enemies, all while reforming the economy along agricultural and rural lines with support from the agrestic masses which make up the bulk of the NCP’s base. Battling against the urban-focused Fianna Fáil, party leaders Frank MacDermot and James Dillon shall guide Ireland back towards its traditional Christian roots as a nation of farmers, shepherds, and bucolic paradise, ensuring an end to rural neglect."
IRE_End_Anglo_Irish_Hostilities: "End Anglo-Irish Hostilities"
IRE_End_Anglo_Irish_Hostilities_desc: "Hibernia and Brittania are truly brothers till the end, and while our history with the Anglos has been checkered at best, we can not deny our shared ties, history, and future. The National Centre Party has always aimed to end the Anglo-Irish Trade War, and now that these rural agrarians run the show, this goal of rapprochement can finally begin. The vendetta against our Eastern brethren will slowly come to an end as we move closer to our former foes economically and diplomatically, ensuring prosperity, peace, and pastoral paradise reigns free across our shared Isles."
IRE_Language_Equality: "One Ireland, Two Tongues"
IRE_Language_Equality_desc: "While our fair Irish mothertongue has survived into this modern day and age, it has done so under fire, constantly being erased and driven back into the annals of history by the far more dominant and widespread Anglo lexicon. In accordance with our goals of detente with the English, while still keeping true to our ideas of Gaelic revivalism and Irish cultural protectionism that we share with most Irishmen here on the Emerald Isle, we shall pursue a policy of bilingualism. Irish-Gaelic and English shall be able to be used in both official and private capacities, standing side-by-side as the two official languages of Ireland. Though we shall still pursue a revival of Goidelic language, culture, and identity, English too shall always have a place here as well."
IRE_Protectionism: "Hibernian Protectionism"
IRE_Protectionism_desc: "Ireland stands in a unique position in Europe, cast off the northern seas at the edge of this chaotic continent, stuck between economic zones and trade areas as we flutter in the seabreeze and try to find our own footing. In order to safeguard our own economic prosperity and progress, the NCP has moved to pursue their beloved policy of economic protectionism. In order to continue to ease relations with England, these tariffs, import quotas, and other protections shall be mediated for English markets - for the most part - while we direct our attention to the Continentals and the Americas. We will build a strong and stable economy built by Irishmen, for Irishmen, all upon the backs of our proud and supported farmers and our growing rural population."
IRE_Middle_of_The_Road_Politics: "Stick to the Middle Road"
IRE_Middle_of_The_Road_Politics_desc: "The radicals of the ANH or of O’Duffy’s Blueshirts are no different from the rotten Syndicalists of the Irish Workers League and their Socialist allies in groups like Sinn Féin. Both factions seek to dismantle the independent and democratic republic we have toiled so hard to build; we can not allow this! The policy of the National Center Party is one of opposing radicalism at every step, safeguarding the democratic system that every true Irishman knows and loves. We shall safeguard the middle way; a blazing and righteous path between Leftist naivety and Rightist shortsightedness, between the authoritarian liberalism of Fine Gael and the urban-focused greed of our main rivals Fianna Fáil, for the good of all on the Emerald Isle."
IRE_Agrarianism: "Farmers at the Foundation"
IRE_Agrarianism_desc: "The National Center party was founded by and for farmers, originally being called the National Farmers and Ratepayers League for a reason. Despite the urbanist focus of our main rivals across the democratic spectrum, it is we who have seized the mandate of the masses to lead the republic into a new bucolic age. The rates system of property taxes that exists as a holdover from the British system shall be removed from all agricultural land, allowing our farmers to reinvest that money into their fields and pastures while new modernization and mechanization measures are taken to drag our agricultural processes out of the stone age. Pastoralist practices traditional to the Emerald Isle shall also be revived, further distancing ourselves from the antiquated and foreign farming methods of our old oppressors. With farmers as the foundation and with ruralism and pastoralism in our hearts, Ireland shall come to embody the arcadian idyll as we make the Emerald Isle even more verdant and green."
IRE_Central_Bank: "Reform the Central Bank"
IRE_Central_Bank_desc: "A central goal of the NCP platform has always been to reform the banking system of Ireland. Despite being an independent nation, our monetary system is still heavily tied to the British pound sterling area, and though Collins attempted to create an independent Irish bank during his time in office, he largely failed in this pursuit, leaving our finances in limbo. A new central bank shall be created for Ireland, independent of other currencies and centered around the Irish Punt. Furthermore, this move shall be paired with deflation measures through nation-wide pay cuts and other protectionist policies, finally freeing our economy from the vices and virtues of foreigners for the benefit of all in Éire."
IRE_Oppose_Valera: "Oppose Valera's Conservatism"
IRE_Oppose_Valera_desc: "Éamon de Valera and his lackeys in Fianna Fáil have long been our largest rivals, with our parties sharing much of the same Conservative positions and policies. However, de Valera’s idea of Conservatism and Nationalism hinges far too much on faux populism, urbanist decadence, rural neglect, and a sinful interpretation of Irish Christianity as he wields these positions as tools to win over the masses instead of bringing true prosperity to our people. We shall work to weaken Fianna Fáil, taking their members and supporters under our wing so that we may grow to become the face of Irish Conservatism and Center-Right republicanism, revealing the truth to all those that will see it."
IRE_Centrist_Ireland: "A Rural Ireland of the Centre"
IRE_Centrist_Ireland_desc: "Under the guidance of the National Centre Party, Ireland has begun to embrace its pastoralist past, ushering in a new age of rural prosperity across the Emerald Isle. Our farmers and laborers are supported by conservative populism and our strong financial reform, our fields blow in the wind more verdant and fertile than ever before, our economy hums along strong and independent, and our people rejoice under God and united by a non-radical yet devout sense of patriotism and Gaelic nationalism. The English no longer bite at our heels, and the British Isles have seen peace and cooperation for the first time in centuries. Let us rejoice and sally forth as the NCP continues to breathe life into our free Irish agrarian democracy."

IRE_Brugha: "Sinn Féin Victory"
IRE_Brugha_desc: "In a shocking win for the Irish working-class that deals a tremendous blow to the traditionally Conservative atmosphere of our democracy, Sinn Féin has risen as victors in the recent elections. Founded by Arthur Griffith in 1905, the original members of Sinn Féin went on to found the revolutionary Irish Republic and its first domestic parliament, the Revolutionary, or First, Dáil before splitting up and fracturing during our civil war and fight for freedom. Translating to ‘We, Ourselves’, Sinn Féin is expected to pursue the dream of a Democratic Socialist Republic for Ireland, supported by Left-wing Irish Nationalism, socioeconomic progressivism, and secularism, though many within the party still support and push Christian ethics and morality, driving a wedge in the party’s unified front. Regardless of this debate, Sinn Féin shall endure in order to transform Ireland into the pink pearl of our archipelago."

IRE_Solidify_Irish_Republicanism_desc: "Ireland stands free and alone, for We, Ourselves have guided our people to independence. We must enshrine this freedom to be a paramount aspect of our state and identity, for never again shall Ireland be subjected to the whims of foreign powers or subjugated to the desires of far-off tyrants. Social Democracy and incorruptible Republicanism shall ring far and true across the Emerald Isle, cemented by Sinn Féin’s ideas of Leftist nationalism and social patriotism as we rise to be the shepherds of this new air of liberty and national pride."
IRE_Promote_Gaelic: "Revitalize and Adapt Gaelic Tradition"
IRE_Promote_Gaelic_desc: "One of the only near-universally accepted policies among Irish political parties is the revival of the Gaelic language and wider Irish-Celtic culture, and our party is no different. Where our righteous platform differs however is in that we do not wish to merely revive the old and deeply conservative traditions of our past, for we also seek to reform them to better fit our modern sensibilities while distancing it from ideas of religion and traditionalism. We must revive this past legacy and drag it into the light of modernity, creating a reborn and reformed Gaelic identity, language, and culture to support this free and independent Irish republic."

We must make it clear to the masses that while we pursue a Socialist democracy and seek to evolve the predatory Capitalist system, we in no way support the violent radicalism of the Syndicalist menace and their authoritarian allies, or their English benefactors. We will blaze a reform-oriented path towards true and open Leftist, supported by Irish nationalism, Socialist populism, welfare economics, and a desire to ever remain free and independent, all for the good of the Irish masses."

Of course, the Royalists in Canada are no better, desiring Irish subjugation just the same. We will not hitch our wagon to either side, for we know that they only desire the domination of the Irish people and state.

Collins sought to bend to the British, and would have been happy selling our sovereignty to the Angloids in exchange for power and dominance over our Emerald Isle. We must reveal the truth to the masses, sullying the so-called ‘good’ name of Collins as we raise Brugha to be the one and true Father of our free and sovereign Ireland."

IRE_We_Ourselves_desc: "Sinn Féin Amháin, or We, Ourselves Alone, is the motto of not only Sinn Féin, but of our free Ireland at large. Coined by Irish nationalists at the beginning of the century, this motto has binded us together in our struggle for true freedom and independent prosperity. Under the ingenious and unifying vision of Brugha and his Sinn Féin, Ireland has prospered and flourished like never before, opening every door to the people as we create a Social Democratic paradise. Though our party still argues over matters of religion and economics, we shall sally forth and continue this prosperous new era for the good of all in Éire."

IRE_MILITARYINDUSTRY_desc:0 "Whilst the people of Ireland would prefer peace to war, there is no doubt that war may very well be on the horizon. With an enemy across the Irish Sea and more still waiting in the wings, Ireland must build her military industry if she hopes to survive the coming storm."
IRE_HEAVYINDUSTRY:0 "Heavy Industrial Focus"
IRE_HEAVYINDUSTRY_desc:0 "Ireland is a small nation and can only spare so much space for a military arms complex.

IRE_OFFICERSCHOOL:0 "Establish the ATÓÉ"
IRE_OFFICERSCHOOL_desc:0 "Currently, many officers in our army lack proper training as a result of our armed forces being descended from a guerrilla rather than a professional army.

IRE_CAPITALFLEET_desc:0 "If we are to stand up to the British, we must be able to build a fleet similar to their own. While this will take a long time it will pay off in the end, just as it did for Germany which once also had a far inferior fleet to the British."
IRE_CAPITALFLEET2:0 "Better Battleships"
IRE_CAPITALFLEET2_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to build a grand fleet to match the British, we should look into the building of a Super-Heavy Battleship. While it will take a long time to build and will be expensive, the results should be worth it."
IRE_RUTHLESS:0 "Ruthless Interdiction Doctrine"

ire.2.d:0 "After countless years of arduous rebellion and weathering oppressive British rule, the Irish people have won their freedom, and their country back. But as one enemy was vanquished, another rose in her place, perhaps yet more dangerous still. Michael Collins sits as President, eager to defend the independence of his nation at any cost, yet his political enemies are many as the 1937 election approaches. Violence between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil is rife, while Sinn Féin; while as not popular as the other two, presents itself as a moderate alternative. Ireland is a powder keg, and it's only a matter of time until it explodes. "
ire.2.a:0 "These are turbulent times."

ire.53.t:0 "Problems Up North"
ire.53.d:0 "Edward Carson, the former leader of the Unionist Party, died last year aged 81. He was an extremely divisive figure whilst alive and fled to England when Ireland gained her independence and took back Ulster. He was particularly reviled outside of Ulster for his persecution of beloved Irish poet and author Oscar Wilde. His memory was venerated today by loyalists in the north of Ireland, who held a memorial service in Belfast with several leading members of the UUP speaking in his name. The memorial attracted quite a crowd, showing that Carson still has power even in death. His spectre is looming over Ulster, just as the tensions and threat of rebellion loom over it as well."

ire.4.a:0 "What a relief."
ire.5.t:0 "Disgruntled Populace in Ulster"
ire.5.d:0 "For some time now, there has been a slow but surely growing unrest in the northern region of Ireland, Ulster. Stirred up by predominantly Protestant Unionists, who advocate for closer ties with England, Ulster has become something of a problem region for the Dáil. If this situation is not handled carefully, the issues that divide the region are sure to grow more incendiary."
ire.5.a:0 "This is a delicate matter."
ire.6.t:0 "Radical Movements Mobilising"
ire.6.d:0 "In response to what they see as oppressive policies towards the people of Ulster, Unionist organisations are growing more radical and attracting the most disenfranchised and angry Northerners to their cause.

ire.6.a:0 "Bloody radicals."
ire.7.t:0 "Riots in Belfast"
ire.7.d:0 "The streets of Belfast are in an uproar after the Unionists have begun to make their play for a general uprising. Disgruntled Ulstermen, the vast majority of which are Protestants, have taken to the streets in a violent stand against what they believe to be hostile intentions from Dublin. The Dáil has called an emergency meeting to address their grievances, but that may not be enough to stop them."
ire.7.a:0 "Madness."
ire.8.t:0 "Civil War Imminent"
ire.8.d:0 "All measures, peaceful or otherwise, to try and pacify Ulster has failed. The Ulster Unionists, backed by the Ulster Volunteer Force, have announced their independence from Ireland and have declared that they will defend the province of Ulster to the death from Dublin, and Catholic, rule. A civil war is inevitable."
ire.8.a:0 "God help us."

ire.131.t:0 "Radical Movements Diminishing"
ire.131.d:0 "The more radical elements of the Ulster region are slowly but surely diminishing. While the core members will remain as extreme as ever, they are finding it harder to recruit new members thanks to our latest policy changes. If things turn for the worse though, they'll most likely find followers soon enough, and we have to be wary. There's no peace in Ulster yet, only silence."
ire.131.a:0 "We'd best stay on our guard."

ire.132.t:0 "Riots Dispersed"
ire.132.d:0 "The streets of Belfast have been silenced and there are no riots anymore. Bricks, newspapers and trash litter the sideways as people return to work. However, the people who participated believe they have only lost a battle, not the war. In their work-place, at the pub and at home they whisper of when to strike next, not if."

# Election Events

ire.14.d:0 "The time for elections in Ireland has come at last, and with that the people head to the polls to elect Ireland’s new government. Unlike every other election in recent memory, Collins is not the overwhelming favourite to win, as Fianna Fail wages a brutal campaign against Collins; denouncing him as a jaded old war hero only kept in power by the weight of his name. Collins has shot back; both refuting these claims, and steadily working to prove to Ireland that he still has policies to bring to the table.\n Meanwhile, Sinn Fein continues positioning themselves as a non-violent and non-radical option compared to Fine Gael and Socialists; receiving a surge in power not seen since the fall of the now-defunct Irish Labour Party.\n Another dark-horse party that has been steadily gaining power is the National Center Party; which has been steadily growing since the economic slump began. While most of the major parties in contention for the seek to preserve Ireland’s democratic system as-is, the Socialist Irish Worker League has been steadily gaining power with funding and support from the Union of Britain. The IWL promises to tear down Ireland’s current system and usher in a Syndicalist Revolution in the Emerald Isle, and while their chances of winning the elections are very slim, if they manage to pull off a win then it would surely shake the world of Irish Politics to the core; possibly even leading to its end.\n As the votes come in, who has won?"

In the wake of Collins’ death, Eoin O’Duffy, Collin’s Taoiseach and leader of the Army Comrade Association, better known as the Blueshirts has taken ‘temporary’ control of Ireland. However with the situation in Ireland deteriorating rapidly, O’Duffy has considered simply handing control of the state to a group eager to restore order to the Emerald Isle. Stepping up with an offer to lead is the the Ailtirí na hAiséirghe or Architects of Resurrection; lead by a curious man named Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin. This movement promises O’Duffy a place in the cabinet if he authorizes them to take charge, an ideal situation for O’Duffy, who desires not leadership but rather a place as a militia leader. Will O’Duffy take the ANH up on their offer?"

However, many in Collins’ cabinet, namely one Taoiseach Eoin O’Duffy, have suggested dissolving Ireland’s civilian government entirely, and formalizing Ireland as a Military Dictatorship under the Irish Republican Army watchful eye. With all powers held within Collins’ hands, he is fit to shape Ireland in his vision, no longer abided by the gullible masses, what will our Ceannaire make of the government? "

Replacing him as the leader of Fine Gael is Richard Mulcahy, a long-time member of Fine Gael and fellow general and freedom fighter in the Irish Republican Army. This marks the end of an era for Ireland, as Fine Gael begins moving away from being just the ‘Party of Collins', and instead as a party dedicated to pragmatic liberalism, Irish unity and defense against English influence.

However, their rise in socio-economic status came often at cost to the Protestant residents of the region, who had previously enjoyed such unbridled dominance over the Catholic minority. A group of Ulster Unionist factory workers went on strike today citing unfair pay and unwarranted treatment by their Catholic employer. Their strike soon turned violent when they were attacked by what some believe to be hired thugs. Nobody was killed, although Belfast City Hospital had plenty of patients in the immediate aftermath.

Whilst the words 'revolt' or 'uprising' might not have been spoken out loud, they were certainly thought.

Five hundred people are believed dead and many more could follow when an official death count is taken. Two men believed to have been responsible for the bombing were shot dead by the Gardaí as they attempted to flee the scene and put up resistance when asked to stand down. At least one of the men has been identified as a Belfast native with known Unionist ties. This terrifying escalation of the on-going conflict in Ulster is tantamount to a declaration of war upon Ireland and her people, and the public outcry has been enormous. The Irish people are baying for blood, and it is Ulster that may have to pay the price."

Ulster Unionists are said to be considering their options whilst the Irish Republican Army is preoccupied with the on-going conflict, and they very well may use this opportunity to try and break free from the Republic. The consequences of such an action could be grave for the nation, as they might very well attempt to align themselves with our enemies and would provide a perfect base for an invasion of Ireland."

However, now that hostile volunteer forces have joined the Republican forces, it would be fair to say that the civil war in Ireland is not necessarily developing to our advantage. If we were to invest any more of our own military even as 'volunteers' then it could be seen as a direct act of war by our hostile neighbours in Europe and across the Atlantic.

This is another clear attempt by the Union of Britain to steal Ireland back through a Unionist puppet. The conflict has escalated yet again, but the Irish people will not give up until the matter is put to rest, no matter how much French, English, or Unionist blood needs to be spilled."

Thus, Ceannaire Collins’ has ordered Valera’s political party, Fianna Fáil to be dissolved and banned, and for de Valera himself to be placed under arrest.\n Unfortunately, Valera seems to have been a step ahead of Collins, as he had fled to America mere days before the police were set to haul him off to prison. While having Valera lost to a land beyond the waves is not ideal, the chaotic situation in America is nowhere close to comfortable for the disgraced rebel Valera.

Though a majority of the voices in the government have called for an Irish monarch for an Irish kingdom some dissenters, inspired by Patrick Pearse have offered an alternative, warning that Ireland may not be able to stand against the Syndicalist powers of Britain and France, as well as the Plotting Monarch in Canada without Foreign protection. To this end he has selected Prince Joachim of Prussia, the sixth son of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Joachim does not speak English, and some hope that his complete lack of ties to the Anglos will allow us to influence his government towards the de-anglicisation of Ireland, and perhaps the entire Isles. This fusion of Irish monarchy with Prussian constitutionalism would allow for Ireland to seek protection under the Kaiser’s watchful eye. Though this would, naturally, require us to reject a Native candidate. Some have voiced their fears that this is selling Ireland to the Germans, and that German occupation will be no better than the English; of course this is but fear-mongering, and appropriate balances will be placed on the monarchy, assuring that the King is merely a representative of Ireland on the world stage."

To this end monarchists have instead suggested offering the crown to Oskar of Prussia, the older brother of Joachim, who would be less burdened by the crown than his younger brother. Of course, we don't have to reject Joachim simply because he is already king; it's not as if he will be actively required for day-to-day ruling regardless. However, there is a third option, forming a personal union between the two kingdoms of Georgia and Ireland; though the two crowns have little in common; this merger would allow Joachim to rule both countries from whichever country he resides in, and would further integrate Ireland into the crowns of Europe."
