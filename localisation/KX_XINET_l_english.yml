Shepard were having tea this evening in the UoB, chitchatting about their newest ilustration of Winnie the Pooh, a worldknown and renowned children's book, when someone knocked at the door.\nMilne told Shepard to ignore it as it was rude and not the English way to disturb people during tea time, but then the door flew half through the floor.\nA 195cm tall extremely muscular Asian man with a face like a marmor bloc and the sharpest jaw line ever to be seen entered the house and he asked 'Are you ze writers Ernest Howard Shepard and Alan Alexander Milne?'.
