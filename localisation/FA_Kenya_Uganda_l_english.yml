### Events ###
ugken.1.t: "Second Mau Mau Uprising"
ugken.1.d: "The Mau Mau have risen up once again! Despite our best efforts to quell the revolt, The Mau Mau were able to seize several key areas and have declared a Second Uprising. At their helm is a seemingly resurrected Obama, who seems more insane then normal. The Government response has to be swift otherwise we might fall against their rebellion."
ugken.1.a: "Death to the Imperialist Dogs!"
ugken.1.b: "Oh God!"

ugken.2.t: "Collaborationists win Kenyan-Ugandese Elections"
ugken.2.d: "The Collaborationists have won the Kenyan-Ugandese elections, to the dismay of many. It is unknown what their plans are for the nation however, we can only hope the future is bright."
ugken.2.a: "The best possible outcome."

ugken.3.t: "Center-Right Coalition wins Kenyan-Ugandese Elections"
ugken.3.d: "The Centre-Right Coalition has won the Kenyan-Ugandese elections, with celebrations across the nation lasting into the night. It was unsurprising to many that the Centre-Right Coalition would claim victory, but with their plans for the nation known, the future looks bright."
ugken.3.a: "An agreeable outcome."

ugken.4.t: "Center-Left Coalition wins Kenyan-Ugandese Elections"
ugken.4.d: "In an Upset, the Centre-Left Coalition has won the Kenyan-Ugandese elections, with celebrations across the nation lasting into the night. It was unsurprising to many that the Centre-Left Coalition would claim victory, but with their plans for the nation known, the future looks bright."
ugken.4.a: "An unfortunate outcome."

ugken.5.t: "Taking the Fight to Mt. Kenya"
ugken.5.d: "We have finally done it! After a hard fought battle, the Mau Mau have capitulated to our forces. Several key locations are decimated from the conflict but with our Government finally in control, expectations are high for a quick reconstruction."
ugken.5.a: "Death to the KLFA!"

ugken.6.t: "Reassuring Businesses"
ugken.6.d: "We have decided to make pitches to different German industries in the hopes that we can bring investment back to Kenya. However, depending on what we wish to focus on, we can choose to appeal to different companies. Rea Leakey urges us to appeal to German tank producers in the hopes of creating our own armor force, and the wealthy British colonials in Kenya encourage us to appeal to both German and Canadian businesses, though the time spent courting both would mean we would benefit less from each investment. Of course, we could also invest in the construction industry, given the sorry state of our infrastructure after the Mau-Mau Revolt. What should we do?"
ugken.6.a: "Attract armor production"
ugken.6.b: "Invest in the construction industry"
ugken.6.c: "Appeal to both German and Canadian companies"

ugken.7.t: "Nairobian Military Industrial Complex"
ugken.7.d: "In the modern day, the presence of a 'military industrial complex' is becoming commonplace in nations with strong industrial and military capacities. If we want to emulate these nations, we should begin creating our own version of a military industrial complex. Of course, the best place to do this would be in Nairobi, which is our military hub and most important city. With this new institution, we will have an advantage over our neighbors."
ugken.7.a: "Why is there so much smoke?"

ugken.8.t: "Japan Offers Investment"
ugken.8.d: "As of late, investment in Kenya has been minimal, but a strange offer has arrived at our shores. The Japanese Empire is offering to invest in Kenya, likely to undermine the German Empire in the East African region and simultaneously make a profit. Japan is not traditionally seen as a major global investor, but who are we to turn them down if they wish to help us?"
ugken.8.a: "Accept their help!"
ugken.8.b: "We'll stick with the Europeans..."

ugken.9.t: "The Invisible Hand of the Market"
ugken.9.d: "The growth of our markets has been met with a simultaneous growth in the calls for a separation between government regulation and industry. Our most prominent businesses suffer under the boot of our overly bureaucratic regulations and high taxes, and it is time that we let them do what they do best. Without these burdensome regulations, businesses will be free to compete as they should, and the country will prosper as a whole because of it. However, this may come with a resource shortage for the national government."
ugken.9.a: "It is well worth the cost!"

ugken.10.t: "Nationalize the Railroads"
ugken.10.d: "Perhaps the most important industry in Kenya is the railroad industry. German and British investments have created many miles of railroad in the country, but our people are outraged by this state of affairs. They point out that they, not these investors, did the work to build these railroads. Further, the companies cannot be trusted to keep their railroads open in economic crises, as we saw at the beginning of Black Monday, and it would be safer to give the government control over them so that they would remain open regardless. Let us give these roads to the people!"
ugken.10.a: "We will not be taken advantage of anymore!"`

ugken.11.t: "Targeted Trade Barriers"
ugken.11.d: "It has become a matter of significant concern that foreign interests have been exploiting Kenyan resources for their own gain. The Entente, the Germans, even the Japanese; they have all tried to steal our wealth and make it their own. Even if Germany is ostensibly our colonial overlord, they have asked for too much. There is little we can do to oppose them, but we will do our best to assert our right to resources that belong to us. The British, meanwhile, have interests everywhere in Kenya, yet they do not have our best interests in mind. Enacting trade barriers against them could be yet another step in our economic recovery. Finally, the Japanese, a bizarre new trading partner, seem to think they can treat us the way the Europeans do. Their arrogance blinds them, and we could teach them a lesson in diplomacy. We must make a decision: who should we target?"
ugken.11.a: "Go after the Germans!"
ugken.11.b: "The British will make a good target!"
ugken.11.c: "Stop the Japanese!"

ugken.12.t: "Lessons for the Army"
ugken.12.d: "Many of our people still remember the destructive days of the Weltkrieg, in which warfare devastated Europe and even came to Kenya. We should study the major battles of this war in order to exact as many lessons as possible from what occurred. Some of our advisors have pointed to the Battle of Verdun, in which the soldier's spirit prevailed, as an example of how to conduct modern warfare. Others have instead pointed to the Somme and noted that the lessons learned about trench warfare and defensive tactics in this battle should be emulated in Kenya. Which battle should we take as an example?"
ugken.12.a: "Learn from Verdun"
ugken.12.b: "Learn from the Somme"

ugken.13.t: "Slash-and-Burn Tactics"
ugken.13.d: "One of the largest lessons we learned in the Mau-Mau Revolt was the effectiveness of scorched earth tactics in modern warfare. Wars nowadays are not like the wars of old, and they involve not only the armies, but the entire populations of the belligerent nations. To adapt to such warfare, we should adopt some form of these tactics for our own uses, so that if we are ever invaded by a larger, more powerful rival, we will be ready to fend them off. What tactics should we use?"
ugken.13.a: "Conscription and Harassment"
ugken.13.b: "Speed and Recovery"
ugken.13.c: "Focus on Doctrine instead"

ugken.14.t: "Night of the Long Spears"
ugken.14.d: "We have found proof that the most prominent United Kenya Front politicians in our country had ties to the Mauists, with some even maintaining said ties until recently! This is disastrous for the country as a whole, and these traitors must be dealt with. To do so, we will arrest these leaders, and those who will resist will meet a more grizzly fate..."
ugken.14.a: "It had to be done."

ugken.15.t: "Targeted Raids"
ugken.15.d: "In the aftermath of the Mau-Mau revolt, Bob Leakey has come to understand that many of their troops still exist, albeit without any real leadership. That fact matters little, though, if these bandits harass our villages in the countryside, our merchants in the cities, or even our own troops in their barracks. Thousands of such bandits still roam free, some of them supposedly belonging to our own army, and we must decide where to concentrate our efforts to root them out. Whatever we decide, we will need to adapt if we are to match the unconventional tactics of these rebels. Where should we concentrate?"
ugken.15.a: "Root them out in the jungle"
ugken.15.b: "Pursue them into the mountains"

ugken.16.t: "University Restoration"
ugken.16.d: "With many of the troublesome leftists in the higher professions and universities eliminated, we can now move forward with a new intellectual elite. This new elite will be loyal to our government, and more importantly, to a united Kenya. With their help, we will ensure stability in Kenya for years to come!"
ugken.16.a: "Wonderful!"

ugken.17.t: "Addressing the Workers"
ugken.17.d: "It is time for us to address the elements of our society that were the most troublesome during the Mauist Revolt. Chief among these groups were our very own workers, whose complaints of mistreatment and unfair payment led them to revolt in large numbers. Now that our coalition is in power, we must decide what to do with this rabble. We could grant them better compensation for their work, but doing so would cost us money we currently lack due to the drying up of German and other European investment. Alternatively, we could bring in labor from other colonies or regions in order to fill the need for labor. Or, if both options are too extreme, perhaps we could maintain the status quo, although this would do nothing to address the causes of revolt. What should we do?"
ugken.17.a: "Better compensation for workers"
ugken.17.b: "Bring in immigrant labor to replace them"
ugken.17.c: "Enforce the status-quo"

ugken.18.t: "Societal Safeguards"
ugken.18.d: "The Mau-Mau Revolt made it clear that the people cannot be trusted to organize without undermining the national government. Unions, leftist parties, and even gatherings or meetings could all fracture our country once more, and we will not allow this. As such, proposals have been set forth to deal with this threat. If we ban these organizations, we can seriously undermine their ability to spread. Further, our German and British industrialists are recommending we foster some sort of competition among our farmers. By granting subsidies to farmers who meet certain quotas or who have certain amounts of land, we can inspire them to fight amongst themselves rather than against our government. It is a genius ploy, but perhaps we would be better off just banning the organizations."
ugken.18.a: "A little competition never hurt anyone..."
ugken.18.b: "Focus on eradicating the leftist groups!" 

ugken.19.t: "Dreams of Social Democracy"
ugken.19.d: "Unlike the Syndicalists, Marxists, and other extremists in Kenya, we wish to create a new left through peaceful and reformist means. Of course, the Mau-Mau Revolt left a significant stain on the left as a whole in the region, and it is a wonder we were able to win the election at all. Only through a coalition of the center-left parties were we able to emerge victorious. With the election behind us, it would be wise to distance ourselves from the Mauists and any that associated with them. However, there are many different ways we could do this. We could beat the Mauists and even our other rivals at their own game, mobilizing masses of people for our own goals and adopting populist rhetoric. On the other hand, we could work with more conservative elements in the government to help suppress these rebels. Doing so might lose us some credibility with our supporters, but we must do what we can to prevent another uprising."
ugken.19.a: "Take the fight to the people!"
ugken.19.b: "Work to suppress these unsavory elements!"

ugken.20.t: "The Healthcare Question"
ugken.20.d: "One of our most significant promises to our people before the election was to implement a new system of healthcare. Such a system is non-existant in Kenya, and if we want to catch up with the modern world, creating a healthcare system for our people is paramount. However, members of the United Kenya Front disagree on what type of healthcare should be advocated. Some have pushed for a system akin to Germany's system, in which mandatory health insurance would be implemented for certain employees and low-income workers. This system would be primarily government run, though the exact details of this will likely be ironed out with time. It would be difficult to get past the other parties, but it would undoubtedly be popular with our people. On the other hand, we could implement a system in which healthcare would be provided for our oldest people only and would be paid into by those who would eventually benefit from it. Health insurance would also be available to people below a certain age, but for a cost to insurance companies. This would be better for our corporations, who would profit more from such a system, and it would certainly be an improvement for our people. If neither option is palatable, we could just maintain the status quo and leave the issue of healthcare for later down the line. What shall we do?"
ugken.20.a: "A government-run system"
ugken.20.b: "A corporate health insurance system"
ugken.20.c: "Keep the status quo"

ugken.21.t: "Dealing with the Center-Left Coalition"
ugken.21.d: "Though we have been blamed by some for the Mau-Mau Revolt, the reality is that the leftists in our congress have inhibited any serious action on our part for years, and in the process, prevented us from doing what we had to do to squash the Mauist Revolt in its infancy. As such, we should punish these traitors, who stood in our way naively at best, and malevolently at worst. Should we ban the Kenyan Unity Party, the furthest left party, or shall we arrest the traitors outright so we can keep an eye on them?"
ugken.21.a: "Ban the party!"
ugken.21.b: "Arrest this rabble!"

ugken.22.t: "Deciding Our Future"
ugken.22.d: "The collapse of Mittelafrika has sent shockwaves through a continent. Now that enjoy relative freedom from both Mittelafrika's influence and our overlords in Germany, we can decide where our loyalties truly lie. We could remain faithful to the Kaiser in Germany and pledge our support to any wars they may have in the future. Alternatively, we have many British colonists from the days of British control, and they are urging us to align ourselves with the Entente, as we were in the past. The loudest voices of all, though, are clamoring for us to forge our own path forward, towards a free Kenya. What shall we do?"
ugken.22.a: "Stay loyal to the Germans"
ugken.22.b: "Go our own way"
ugken.22.c: "Side with the Entente"

ugken.23.t: "An odd but effective trio"
ugken.23.d: "The night air was cold and crisp as it whipped against the anglos’ faces. They lay in wait, squatting in cover behind a small rock wall covered by scrub-bushes and overgrowth. As this brave trio lay in wait, their quarry fast approached. Shuffling up the nearby path was a detachment of Mau-Mau rebels on the retreat from their failed offensive at Isiolo. While the rest of the Kenyan Frontier Forces stayed back in the city, celebrating their victory over the marxist dogs with drinks and smoke, the brave heroes of Jack Churchill, Digby Tatham-Warter, and Bill Millin knew the job was not yet done and abandoned their jovial comrades to pursue their prey. As the ragtag group of totalist rebels meandered their way up the path, a sharp melody began to blare, seemingly coming from all directions as it echoed in the still quiet of the night. As the cacophony continued, originating from Millin’s bagpipes, “Mad Jack” Churchill arose from behind the way, drawing his long bow and sending an arrow directly though the right eye of the rebel leading the column. With this shot striking true, the Mau-Mau began to scream in a panic, diving for what little cover could be found as they readied their makeshift rifles. Before any of them could fire off a first shot, another arrow planted itself firmly in the chest of the chief rebel officer as Mad Jack and Digby fired volley after volley at the rebel scum. At this point, the Mau-Mau began to return fire, though in their panicked state each of their shots failed to find a target in the dark. With lighting-fast speed and under Digby’s suppressive volley, Mad Jack lept forth, drawing his broadsword from its scabbard and charged the Mau-Mau line as Millin continued to play “Scotland Forever'' on his glorious bagpipes, drowning out the noise of screams and pleas for mercy with the jaunty, nationalist tune. As Mad Jack got stuck in with the separatists, Digby too joined the melee, wielding the umbrella he became infamous for carrying as a bludgeon against this totalist scum. By the end of the bloodshed, the trio stood blood soaked and wild-eyed, triumphantly cheering over their new found victory. Wiping the blood from their sabres and umbrella and reclaiming the arrows now lodged in dead reds, the trio marched back to camp, eager to join in on their comrades celebrations. Drinks all around for a well fought victory!"
ugken.23.a: "Any officer who goes into action without his sword is improperly dressed"

ugken.24.t: "The Fate of Kenya-Uganda"
ugken.24.d: "Kenya and Uganda were merged during the chaos of the British Revolution, consolidating these two bastions of Anglo influence under German control while allowing the Brits to have a considerable degree of autonomy. With the Collapse, the Mittelafrikan occupation had ended, inciting rebellion in Uganda, splitting the union in two, forcing us to retake these lands by the sword. With our rule reestablished, we now must decide what to do with these lands."
ugken.24.a: "Restore Kenya-Uganda!"
ugken.24.a: "Split these two valuable and restless regions apart."

### Decisions ###
KEN_maumau_actions: "Fighting the Mau-Mau Insurgents"
KEN_maumau_actions_desc: "The Mau Mau in Kikuyuland have been rebelling against us since the 1925 revolution. So far we have contained them to the mountains of eastern Kenya, but they continue to disrupt our operations in the colony and they undermine our legitimacy with the locals."
KEN_maumau_1: "Collaborationist Approach"
KEN_maumau_1_desc: "Echoing sentiments of their friends, or masters, in Dar-Es-Salaam and Berlin, the National Rejuvenation Party seeks to strike the Mau-Mau in a two-pronged attack to cleanse their plague from Kenya-Uganda. With aid from the Germans, they seek to bribe, incentive, and if necessary, intimidate any and all potential supporters of the Mau-Mau radicals. No matter the economic cost nor loss of life, Obama and his savage gang must be contained and destroyed at all costs. By swaying and scaring the locals while disrupting their operations, we will starve them out in the scrublands around Wajir."
KEN_maumau_2: "Conservative Approach"
KEN_maumau_2_desc: "The Unionist wing of the Joint Unionist party serves as the anchor of conservative politics and economics in Kenya-Uganda. Agreeing with their coalition members on only some issues, they both share a strong love of Laissez-Faire policies. With these roots in free-enterprise mixed with their vaguely populist, Social Conservative leanings, the Unionists will apply both reform and new monetary incentives to those prone to Mau-Mau support, the lower classes, to weaken the support base of the vile Marxists. Though the strain on our industry will be noticeable for a time, the benefit to both our people and to the destruction of our enemies is too large to pass up."
KEN_maumau_3: "Market Lib. Approach"
KEN_maumau_3_desc: "Reigning as the more free-market orientated, ‘liberal’ wing of the conservative Joint Unionist Party, the Farmer’s Alliance believe they know the secret to dismantling the Mau-Mau’s rebellion. With much of the Mau-Mau’s manpower and support coming from destitute and disgruntled farmers across the Kenyan Highlands, these Market Liberals wish to pass a slew of farmer-friendly reforms and directives to both turn the farmers against one another as they compete for the few slots in the government programs, but also drawing these farmers into the arms of the state and away from the clutches of Obama and his raucous band. Though this will tie up funds and factories destined for other projects, crushing these vagabonds is our top priority."
KEN_maumau_4: "Social Dem. Approach"
KEN_maumau_4_desc: "The leftist, labourist wing of the United Kenya Front’s approach to weakening the Totalist rebels: by striking at their public support. Seeking to win the support of the natives and reduce the allure of Obama’s siren song of demagoguery, these Social Democrats seek to offer new incentives and pass new pro-worker legislation to alleviate the plight of the lower classes, hoping to use the reforms to lure potential Mau-Mau supporters away from their barbaric extremism. Though our economy will drag along for a few months as it adapts to these new concessions, the support these Labourites will steal from the Mau-Mau is worth the economic pain."
KEN_maumau_5: "Hardline Approach"
KEN_maumau_5_desc: "The venomous cretens of the so-called ‘Mau-Mau’ are our highest priority! By allocating additional military supplies to our frontier forces and authorizing more raids into the rebel’s territory, we will ensure their destruction, wiping this Totalist plague from the Dark Continent. This increased military pressure will undoubtedly cause many casualties to the Mau-Mau’s forces, but will also likely see sympathy for them grow within the native populace; we must keep an eye on this."


### Focuses ###
KEN_theeconomyyoufools: "The Economy, You Fools!"
KEN_theeconomyyoufools_desc: "The Mau-Mau Revolt has clearly had a detrimental effect on our economy; we are nearing a recession and the economy is in full meltdown. We will have to act quickly, or we won't be able to enact any policies at all. Such inaction would hamper our ability to help the people and perhaps lead to the demise of our government-something must be done!"
KEN_aindustryofarmor: "An Industry of Armor"
KEN_aindustryofarmor_desc: "Rea Leakey was always a major proponent of tanks and motorised equipment, a man ahead of his time. Now that we are introducing his ideas, it would be a wise idea to begin streamlining the production of tanks and motorised equipment to ensure they are created as quickly and efficiently as possible."
KEN_doctrineofoffence: "Doctrine of Offense"
KEN_doctrineofoffence_desc: "When referring to opponents, Leakey always said that no quarter should be given to the enemy, and that the army should constantly attack them to make sure they are disorganised and tired. This would leave them open for a final crippling blow to their forces and give us the advantage. Let us introduce these offensive tactics into the army as soon as possible."
KEN_expandthearmsindustry: "Expand the Arms Industry"
KEN_expandthearmsindustry_desc: "Now that we have dealt with the Mauist revolt, it is quite clear that we need to expand the arms industry to prevent a future uprising of similar character. We cannot predict when the next native rebellion will occur; regardless of the concessions we give to the native populace, it seems they are never satisfied. Towards a more secure future! "
KEN_industrialresearch: "Industrial Research"
KEN_industrialresearch_desc: "The colonial empires in Europe were able to colonize the world thanks in part to their industrial prowess. Kenya may never be an empire on that scale, but if we wish to prosper as a region, the best investment of our limited resources may be in the form of industrial research. This will allow us to begin some sort of industry in Kenya while also improving efficiency in our production."
KEN_aharrasingrea: "A Harassing Rea"
KEN_aharrasingrea_desc: "The Rea Tank (named after the RVA leader, Rea Leakey) is nothing less than a perfect machine, but with our new doctrines, we may have to modify it somewhat. A tank for the people shall be one that is both swift and cheap. We shall turn the Rea into a tank that can not only be mass-produced, but also be quick enough for the new hit and run tactics that we have developed."
KEN_dealwiththeoligarchicalcollectevists: "Fight Oligarchical Collectivists"
KEN_dealwiththeoligarchicalcollectevists_desc: "The United Kenya Front is made up of fools, scoundrels, and worse. They are the worst party in Kenya, nothing more than RAA Mauists hiding in plain sight. Now that we have emerged as the victorious party in the recent election, however, we shall teach them how wrong they are in thinking that they are well hidden..."
KEN_dealwiththefanatics: "Deal with the Fanatics"
KEN_dealwiththefanatics_desc: "Somehow, despite our many attempts to snuff them out, the Mau Mau's most extreme elements still exist. While our army is calmly dealing with the remnants of this rebellion, an interesting question has been raised. That is, primarily, the question of what the army should become in this new Kenya. What will their role be in our government?"
KEN_dealwiththefalseliberals: "Deal with the False Liberals"
KEN_dealwiththefalseliberals_desc: "Ever since this Kenyan "Unity" Party has been formed, it has done nothing more than cause trouble in our nation. Even worse, they have prevented us from dealing with the problem of Syndicalism, not to mention the emergence of the Mau-Mau movement. They must be dealt with for their willful incompetence; we will bring stable, competent governance to Kenya."
KEN_thesteelsword: "The Steel Sword"
KEN_thesteelsword_desc: "As the dust settles, it appears that the National Rejuvenation Party has maintainted its power. The NRP is a pro-German authoritarian party that hopes to improve Kenyan relations with both Dar es Salaam and Berlin. Their new leader, the youthful but energetic economist Robert "Bob" Leakey, is now in charge, and we will see what his party can do to recover from the stains of the previous few years of rule."
KEN_agoodeconomist: "A Good Economist"
KEN_agoodeconomist_desc: "We are confident that the Kenyan economy will prosper under the stewardship of Bob Leakey. It is quite clear that there are few in Nigeria that possess his understanding of the laws of economics, and now that the rebellion has been put down, we can focus on this aspect of governance without interruption. The Kenyan economy will soon be the strongest in the Afrikan colonies!"
KEN_reassurecompanies: "Reassure Companies"
KEN_reassurecompanies_desc: "It is clear that corporations are fearful of a leading National Rejuvenation Party, judging by how vehemently they opposed our election. Specifically, they fear we will promote govenment interference and hurt the company bottom line. Let us reassure them that we are going to cooperate with them and find a way for them to maintain or even improve their profit margins in this wild land. With the corporations on our side, we are one step closer to a prosperous economy!""
KEN_digdeeper: "Dig Deeper"
KEN_digdeeper_desc: "With the advent of new mining technologies, we can now dig deeper into the Earth and more efficiently extract the resources we need to keep our nation afloat in this new world. After all, we cannot rely on the resources we have traditionally exported if we hope to be useful to the Kaiser in his economic woes, and exporting new resources may gain us a second look from Dar es Salaam as well..."
KEN_dealwithtradeunions: "Deal with Trade Unions"
KEN_dealwithtradeunions_desc: "It is time for us to decide how to act towards our trade unions. Trade unions are the second enemy of our state, beaten only by Mauist traitors. These groups have done everything in their power to stop the growth of our industry, from the very first day we came to power. Let us send some of our lads to pay these unions a visit, and, hopefully, we won't have to worry about them anymore."
KEN_nairobianmilitaryindustrycomplexnmic: "Nairobian Military Industry Complex(NMIC)"
KEN_nairobianmilitaryindustrycomplexnmic_desc: "While overseeing the construction of a military factory, Leakey had a magnificent idea. We possess a rather impressive arms industry, but Leakey believes it would be in our best interest to estabilsh a new Military Industrial Complex in Nairobi. This would be an institution that would allow us to support our troops even further, and if all goes as planned, even the DKG's forces in Goeringia. Kenya shall be the arms forge of Mittelafrika!"
KEN_weareinthegreenlads: "We are in the Green"
KEN_weareinthegreenlads_desc: "It seems that we have succesfully transformed the weak and decadent economy of Kenya into a highly profitable one. It is an economy with tons of factories, many happy investors, and better yet, Kenya is now a stable place to ship arms to. We can now safely say that our economic prosperity is here to stay."
KEN_ablackstorm: "A Black Storm"
KEN_ablackstorm_desc: "A man from Russia, of all places, has thrown an interesting idea into our political circles. This man proposes the creation of something called the Yunarmiya, a group that will serve as the perfect organization to instruct future generations on dealing with the syndicalist disease. It shall also serve to secure loyalty in our land, in order to keep rebellious populations in check, and Leakey believes we should implement something akin to this policy."
KEN_cuttheirheads: "Cut Their Heads Off"
KEN_cuttheirheads_desc: "These leftist traitors insist on showing their faces and defying our government, and we will no longer tolerate it. It is finally time to send in the Blackshirts, who will show the leftists the price of defiance! We shall cut the heads off these rebels once and for all."
KEN_hunttheirtroops: "Hunt Their Troops"
KEN_hunttheirtroops_desc: "From our vast farmlands to our most remote forested regions, the collectivists continue their war. They have succeeded in disrupting our food, and, most importantly, our industry. It is high time we find their hidden bases and finish them off. If we rob these rebels of their army, how can they hope to continue their struggle?"
KEN_collectivistswhatcollectivists: "Collectivists? What Collectivists?"
KEN_collectivistswhatcollectivists_desc: "Hurrah, it is done! After the proud work of the Blackshirts and our glorious army, we have finally managed to finish off the collectivists, and the land is now scrubbed from their dirty hands. We have won the trust of the Germans and can now expect the type of investment we once enjoyed. "
KEN_grabthecollectivists: "Grab the Collectivists"
KEN_grabthecollectivists_desc: "Even now that most of the collectivist troops are dead or otherwise eliminated, there are still many citizens, particularly students, who sympathise with their cause. It is high time we sent some Blackshirts to grab these thought traitors and re-educate them, so that they understand why oligarchical collectivism is so detrimental to our nation!"
KEN_lessonsfromnairobi: "Lessons from Nairobi"
KEN_lessonsfromnairobi_desc: "In the Battle of Nairobi, we defied the odds and with Weltkrieg-era tactics, managed to win against the natives. As such, it is in our belief that the old tactics still work, at least in Kenya, and so we shall spend our time improving these tactics rather than abandoning them for a new doctrine entirely."
KEN_reasdream: "Rea's Dream"
KEN_reasdream_desc: "Sir Rea Leakey, RVA representative in the Congress and leader of the KUP, has always said that trucks and tanks will be the way of warfare in the future. His military prowess is widely respected, and our administration is inclined to believe he is right. We should learn from his words and ideas and invest in mechanized forces. "
KEN_adefensiverea: "A Defensive Rea"
KEN_adefensiverea_desc: "The Rea Tank (named after the RVA leader, Rea Leakey) is nothing less than a perfect machine, but with our new doctrines, we may have to modify it somewhat. We shall make sure this tank can complement the defensive nature of our army while also ensuring they can support our lads in the trenches for as long as they can. We shall bombard our enemy into submission!"
KEN_aoffensiverea: "An Offensive Rea"
KEN_aoffensiverea_desc: "The Rea Tank (named after the RVA leader, Rea Leakey) is nothing less than a perfect machine, but with our new doctrines, we may have to modify it somewhat. Rea always envisoned a fast, powerful tank storming through the enemy lines and shattering their defenses into pieces. We shall make the Rea Tank into just that: an overwhelming force."
KEN_kenyianguards: "Kenyan Guards"
KEN_kenyianguards_desc: "While not an idea of Rea Leakey, the idea of Kenyan Guards should be considered. The idea is to create a commando force that will not only be able to scout, but also to harass the enemy and support our forces to make sure they achieve their goals. Whether they are successful or not is a different question, but it is something worthy of testing."
KEN_expandtheofficercorp: "Expand the Officer Corps"
KEN_expandtheofficercorp_desc: "The gentlemen who emerged victorious from the Weltkrieg and the Mau-Mau Uprising are possibly the best and most experienced men we have. However, that does not mean we should exclusively allow them to lead the army; someday, these men will be rotting in the grave, and we will be left with nothing to show for their experience. To remedy this, we shall expand the officer corps into the next generation, so that we can make sure our army will be in competent hands for years to come."
KEN_preparetheartillery: "Prepare the Artillery"
KEN_preparetheartillery_desc: "While our soldiers may have the protection of trenches, it is quite clear we need something to make sure we are not bombarded by the enemy, bombardment that makes trenches nearly useless. What better way to deal with their artillery than by having our own, hopefully better artillery bombing theirs?"
KEN_lessonsfromverdunandsomme: "Lessons from the Somme and Verdun"
KEN_lessonsfromverdunandsomme_desc: "The Battles of Verdun and Somme have taught us important lessons about the modern state of warfare. Verdun showed us how, even in the worst conditions, the simple will and determination of a soldier can protect a location for as long as it is needed, and the Somme taught us how not to conduct an offensive when engaging in trench warfare. It is quite clear that we need to learn from these battles and use this experience in our own military doctrines."
KEN_armyradio: "Army Radios"
KEN_armyradio_desc: "Rea Leakey once proposed the introduction of radio support into our divisions, regiments, and tanks, believing that this would bolster the organization of such units, even in the midst of battle. We should begin production of military radios and make sure the army is supplied with them wherever possible, so that our communication is efficient and we can better adapt to the ever-changing circumstances of warfare."
KEN_thekaiserspartyofkenya: "The Kaiser's Kenya"
KEN_thekaiserspartyofkenya_desc: "Despite the influence of British colonists in Kenya, we have firmly anchored ourselves in the German sphere. Now, the Kaiser has sent representatives to Kenya to survey our progress, and we shall show them that we are a shining example of efficient German governance."
KEN_loyaltyquestions: "Loyalty Questions"
KEN_loyaltyquestions_desc: "With the advent of the Mau-Mau Revolt and the wider chaos in Mittelafrika, the goverment in Dar es Salaam has been receiving mixed messages regarding the loyalty of Kenya. Now that we have finally restored order in Kenya, we can look to our neighbors and our German overlords, and perhaps reconsider our allegiances. Is now the time to break away from the German yolk?"
KEN_kenyianvolunteercorp: "Kenyan Volunteer Corps"
KEN_kenyianvolunteercorp_desc: "We have carefully observed the British and German armies, and we have decided how best to emulate them. Just like the British Volunteer Corps of old, Kenya shall also have such formations. Our volunteer corps will guarantee we have enough men to fight against the perfidious enemies of the grand state of Kenya."
KEN_dealwiththeinternationalists: "Deal with the Internationalists"
KEN_dealwiththeinternationalists_desc: "It is quite evident that the Internationale is supporting some of the less-friendly elements of our government. Specifically, they have supported leftist revolts in the form of the Mau-Mau Uprising and more, generally any resistance that will accept their help. The Syndicalists can only stand in the way of our new left-wing movement, de-legitimizing our regime and inspiring uprisings among extremist elements. Now that we have suppressed the revolts, it is high time that we dealt with these outsider influencers."
KEN_breakthecommune: "Break the Syndicalists"
KEN_breakthecommune_desc: "With their suppliers in Europe cut off, Kenyan leftists lack the resources necessary to continue their struggle against our government. It is time we cornered them in their strongholds and arrested or otherwise eliminated them, once and for all."
KEN_nationalizationofcivicindustry: "Nationalize Civilian Industry"
KEN_nationalizationofcivicindustry_desc: "As part of our Keynsian economic plan, an initiative to begin nationalizing failing companies has begun. After all, why should we allow these greedy corporations to repeat the same actions that caused an economic crisis in the first place? Nationalized industries will allow us greater control over the economy and perhaps a respite from the global chaos of the Black Monday crisis."
KEN_heartheirpleads: "Hear their Pleas"
KEN_heartheirpleads_desc: "The people of Kenya are pleading for our help, and help they shall receive! The first step in achieving this will be to improve our infrastructure. This program will create thousands of jobs for suffering Kenyans and also benefit Kenya in the long term by providing easier access to our commercial hubs. We will bring Kenya back from the brink of collapse and create a prosperous economy for years to come."
KEN_bringeuropeaninvestersback: "Bring European Investers Back"
KEN_bringeuropeaninvestersback_desc: "It is clear to all observers that the Mau-Mau rebellion has scared European investors in Kenya. Investment has all but dried up and our economy has been driven to a halt as a result. Now that we have restored some semblance of stability though, we shall prove to them that there is nothing to fear. Kenya is back on track and our markets will flow once more."
KEN_fixthebarrier: "Fix the Barriers"
KEN_fixthebarrier_desc: "A lot of the states that have invested in us have used our unofficial colonial status to try and exploit our lands and become wealthy in the process. That cannot, and will not, be allowed anymore. We will still allow these investors to be here, but they shall be here under our laws and they will respect them, whether they like it or not."
KEN_adealwiththeworkers: "A Deal with the Workers"
KEN_adealwiththeworkers_desc: "A factory is nothing without its workers, and they know this as much as we do. Ever since our takeover, they have watched our government expectantly, hoping we fulfill our promises of better conditions for workers. We shall prove to them that we mean them no harm and that, in fact, we are fully willing to cooperate."
KEN_tradeunionconcession: "Trade Union Concessions"
KEN_tradeunionconcession_desc: "It is becoming evident that our workers are not that easy to satisfiy. We have given them their deal, yet they still want concessions from our government. However, there is a way we can deal with this, by giving some concessions to the trade unions in particular. In doing so, we can make sure that our workers are in a good state of mind knowing they will be represented, and also ensure that the capitalists don't run and scream that the Syndicalists have come to Kenya. "
KEN_thegoldeneconomy: "The Golden Economy"
KEN_thegoldeneconomy_desc: "With our civilian economy moving again and our workers in a satisfied state, our economy has entered into a new golden age. It seems this new prosperity is here to stay, and for the first time in years, we can say that Kenya is booming."
KEN_rulebritannia: "Rule Britannia"
KEN_rulebritannia_desc: "Berlin be damned! We were a British colony once, and it was a time we remember with fondness to this day. Now that we are free of the German yolk, we shall be a British colony once more! Let us proudly sing "Rule Britannia", for the empire lives on!"
KEN_freehealtcare: "Free Healthcare"
KEN_freehealtcare_desc: "One of the main issues that has plagued the nation is rather ineffective subsidised healthcare system we have. Leftist groups in Kenya have lobbied for some form of universal healthcare for years, but given its status as a colony, this has been ignored. Now that we are in charge though, perhaps it is finally time to implement a free healthcare system for the betterment of our people."
KEN_freeeducation: "Free Education"
KEN_freeeducation_desc: "One of the "Good Friday" agreements was the introduction of multiple socialized laws, none of which concerned education. The New Deal was already planned to address education in Kenya, but with the support of the UKP, it will now certainly pass. Let us deal with our intellectual shortcomings and begin a campaign of free education."
KEN_thekenyandream: "The Kenyan Dream"
KEN_thekenyandream_desc: "A house for every family, a school for our children, and access to medical care for all. Through the combination of these things, we have succeeded in giving our people the chance of fulfilling the Kenyan dream. It might has cost money or even blood, but now, future generations of Kenyans can live in peace and prosperity."
KEN_apopularwar: "A Popular War"
KEN_apopularwar_desc: "In the past, wars in Africa have been fought with small colonial forces against large, outmatched native forces. We will not allow this to be the case any longer! Starting today, we will have popular wars, in which the whole population is involved in one way or another. We will recruit the best men from the villages and bring them into the army, and all of Afrika will tremble at our might!"
KEN_harassandambush: "Harass and Ambush"
KEN_harassandambush_desc: "The vast savannah landscape of Kenya, bolstered by some areas of forest or even jungle, is perfect for harassment and ambush. These tactics have served our ancestors and they should serve us as well. Like a lion in the grass, we shall stalk our prey, and when they least expect it, we shall strike!"
KEN_hitemwheretheyareweak: "Hit 'Em Where It Hurts!"
KEN_hitemwheretheyareweak_desc: "Every military force has a weakness. Just as the Mgai managed to smuggle troops inside Nairobi using weaknesses in our defenses, there are also weak spots in invading armies. If we manage to find these weak spots and hit them hard in their soft underbellies, we will certainly break our enemies and secure the independence of our land for years to come."
KEN_salttheland: "Salt the Land"
KEN_salttheland_desc: "If the enemy comes to take Kenya, they will find nothing but ashes and salt in the land. Kenya is larger than one would expect at first glance, and it is easy to get lost in its vast savannah landscape. By using scorched earth tactics, we can deny our enemy any reprieve and even drain them. When they are at their weakest, they will be ripe for attack."
KEN_apeoplesarmy: "A People's Army"
KEN_apeoplesarmy_desc: "Kenya has yet to fight a proper war on its own. We have only succeeded in beating the Mau-Mau Revolt, and that is because of their ineffective army staff and technology, not any military prowess that we possess. Rea Leakey's dream can only be achieved if we achieved if we were to develop industry akin to Germany or Britain, which is essentially impossible. However, we have our land and our people, and these are things we shall use to great advantage in the coming wars. We shall use the people and guerrilla warfare to beat back any would-be conqueror, and perhaps one day, even take the fight to them..."
KEN_anewdeal: "A New Deal"
KEN_anewdeal_desc: "With the election having come and gone, it seem that the United Kenya Front has emerged victorious. It managed to achieve a political victory even after the fall of the Kenyan Unity Coalition, and now, with Nigel Leakey in charge of the region, he will pursue his vision of a "New Deal" for Kenya. "
KEN_anewcenter: "A New Center"
KEN_anewcenter_desc: "With the recent chaos of the Mauist Rebellion against the colonial goverment, a lot of questions have been raised about the efficacy of the current government. Specifically, there are questions about the Kenyan Unity Party (or what remains under the Kenyan Liberal Party), and what its fate shall be. Of course, they will be allowed to exist officially, but it is quite clear that they have left a mess in their wake, and we should handle their biggest mess: the economy."
KEN_anewleft: "A New Left"
KEN_anewleft_desc: "With a Social Democratic government taking power in Kenya, the question of what to do with the most radical leftist forces has been raised. Though we consider ourselves left-wingers, we are not Syndicalists, and perhaps we will gain some legitimacy by further distancing ourselves from these radicals. Those pursuing a revolution or acting to sow chaos in Kenya will be dealt with, one way or another..."
KEN_hunttheagrarianist: "Hunt the Agrarians"
KEN_hunttheagrarianist_desc: "Agrarian Socialism is one of the most popular forms of leftism in Kenya, being quite popular among our rural populations and in some larger villages. With the rebellion crushed, though, these supporters have abandoned the ideology, and we must hunt down the few left Agrarian Socialists left in Kenya, lest they rise up once more at a future date."
KEN_contactthechinese: "Contact the Chinese"
KEN_contactthechinese_desc: "The Chinese have a wealth of resources that is unparalleled in the rest of the world. They may be behind the West, suffering from political division and corruption, but their economic potential should not be underestimated. Establishing trade relations with the region would benefit us greatly, and we should work towards this goal."
KEN_apopularkenya: "A Popular Kenya"
KEN_apopularkenya_desc: "Our mandate to rule was given to us by the Kenyan people, and we will not forget this fact. We live and rule for Kenya, and our region will enter into a new phase of our history, one in which the people are given the rights the deserve, and can rest easy knowing that tomorrow, they will have food on their table."
KEN_anationalistkenya: "A Nationalist Kenya"
KEN_anationalistkenya_desc: "Kenya is still young compared to most countries in the world, but we have a great deal of nationalistic pride nonetheless. With the help of Germany, we will develop Kenya to become one of, if not the most powerful colonies in all of Afrika. Glory to Kenya, and glory to the Kaiser!"
KEN_afreekenya: "A Free Kenya"
KEN_afreekenya_desc: "We have no need for the false promises of Berlin or Ottawa. Our people grow tired of colonial rule, and now we will finally rule ourselves, for the first time in our history! We will fight to secure our freedom, if we must, but we will give everything to guarantee that we never suffer a colonial overlord again."
KEN_aunitedfront: "A United Front"
KEN_aunitedfront_desc: "Despite the Mau-Mau revolt and the near annihilation that has been caused by our internal struggles, the Kenyan Unionists and the Farmers Alliance have stood strong. Now that he has been given a new mandate to rule, Rea Leakey is determined to fix the mess Kenya has found itself in, one way or another. "
KEN_aneweconomy: "A New Economy"
KEN_aneweconomy_desc: "After the chaos of the Mauist Revolt, the free-form economy of Kenya was in freefall. Companies were leaving left and right, investment had dried up, and our economy seemed as broken as our government. Now though, Rea Leakey plans a new economy, one friendly to investment and willing to trade with anyone. Through this new economy, we will prosper like never before."
KEN_theeuropeancomesback: "The Europeans Return"
KEN_theeuropeancomesback_desc: "It is obvious that European investment did not give us the resources we needed to suppress a major revolt; were it not for the prowess of Rea Leakey, we would have failed as a colony. Therefore, it is clear that we need a much higher level of investment. Can we attract enough interest to truly prosper?"
KEN_bringmoreinvestors: "Bring More Investors"
KEN_bringmoreinvestors_desc: "The market does not discriminate, so, why should we? Instead of the preferential treatment given to German industrialists before, we will open our colony up to investment from the entire world, and we will turn no country away. Any nation who wishes to invest in our glorious future is a worthy trading partner, and so shall it be in Kenya."
KEN_cultivateacapitalistsociety: "Cultivate a Capitalist Society"
KEN_cultivateacapitalistsociety_desc: "Our society does not embody the principles of Capitalism, at least not to the extent that we are able to benefit from it. Instead, we have suffered from colonial exploitation as older and more powerful nations steal our most precious resources. We have had enough of this! Now, we will be the Capitalists, and we shall build a society in which the most talented Kenyans will rise to the forefront and gain wealth beyond their wildest dreams."
KEN_thecapitalistdream: "The Capitalist Dream"
KEN_thecapitalistdream_desc: "We have finally created a Capitalist society in Kenya! After toil, sweat, and significant internal struggles, we have created a society in which the most talented among us can rise to the top, becoming some of the wealthiest men in the continent. Kenya is truly becoming a Capitalist market economy, and our profits have soared in recent months. Let us hope this prosperity continues to grow, and one day, we will be a rival to the colonists themselves!"
KEN_rebelliousworker: "The Rebellious Worker"
KEN_rebelliousworker_desc: "Kenya has been a hotbed for Syndicalist activity for years, inspired by the revolution in our old overlords in Britain. It is no secret that native workers are treated poorly in Kenya, but what they do not understand is that this is how it must be. We lack the resources to pay all our workers enough money to live in luxury, and if they ever wish to live in such a society, we must show them that they will have to work for it. Those who rebel, meanwhile, will be extinguished..."
KEN_exterminatetheplague: "Exterminate the Plague"
KEN_exterminatetheplague_desc: "The one influence worse than Agrarianism or Syndicalism is that of Marxism. It is theis ideology that inspired the Mau-Mau Revolt, and it is this ideology that has undermined our government to this day. If we wish to restore stability to Kenya, we must snuff these elements out, lest we be defeated and overcome ourselves."
KEN_solidifycorporatecontrol: "Solidify Corporate Control"
KEN_solidifycorporatecontrol_desc: "As we hunt the last of the rebellious workers, it is past time we approached the corporations these rebels used to work for. The corporations have used the rebellion as a pretext to demand more power, noting that they do not have the resources they need to put down these revolts. We cannot help but agree-the corporations shall have their dues!"
KEN_acorporateland: "A Corporate Land"
KEN_acorporateland_desc: "After much struggle, we have dealt with the social crisis among the working population, and now the corporations they work for are more powerful than ever. Should another revolt ever emerge, the corporations will stomp it out in its infancy, and we will show the world that there is no better place in Afrika to conduct business."
KEN_acorporatekenya: "A Corporate Kenya"
KEN_acorporatekenya_desc: "Kenya may be behind the nations of Europe and North America, but we have carefully cultivated a Capitalist economy that will allow us to surpass our competition in Afrika and become an industrial power in our own right. Business and industry will never be challenged again in Kenya!"
KEN_letitfloat: "Let it Float"
KEN_letitfloat_desc: "The Kenyan Pound is a currency that was pegged into the Mittelafrikan Reichmark, ever since the establishment of that colony decades ago. However, since that currency is now more or less dead in the wake of Black Monday, the best course of action may in fact be to allow the Kenyan pound float for itself. Through this effort, we will take another step towards restoring our economy."
KEN_thepacifickraken: "The Pacific Kraken"
KEN_thepacifickraken_desc: "The Japanese Co-Prosperity Sphere is beginning to spread its influence across Asia and beyond, becoming a major power in its own right. Its tentacles have even reached our shores, and they have offered to become one of our largest trading partners. They are rivals to both Germany and Canada, but we should accept this deal on principle, as we have promised to work with any nation for a better Kenya. Should we accept their investment?"
KEN_themarketliberalideasexpand: "Growth of Laissez-Faire Economics"
KEN_themarketliberalideasexpand_desc: "It can be seen in our villages and in our streets, and yet it is invisible. The invisible hand of the market has allowed Kenya to prosper before, and it will do so now. While the "hand" may not be visible, our people will certainly feel the impact of the corporate prosperity that Kenya now enjoys. The ideas of Capitalism are expanding and entrenching in Kenya; the Capitalism dream itself is expanding."
KEN_corporatemilitias: "Corporate Militias"
KEN_corporatemilitias_desc: "The future of Kenya is in private milita forces that corporations can use to suppress revolts before they become too powerful for us to deal with. Such tactics have been proven to work in Capitalist nations the world over, and we will employ them here with much success as well. Corporate militias will serve all true Kenyans through their service for corporations, and all of Kenya will prosper as a result. However, we may embolden corporations and lose manpower for our national army in the process..."
