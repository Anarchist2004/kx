MNT_KING_MICHAEL_DESC:0 "King Michael I of house Petrović-Njegoš, King of Montenegro since 1929, was bestowed the crown by Danilo I, Crown Prince. Thus it fell to the young king to sort out the new, autonomous Montenegro and ensure its political integrity for years to come. A supporter of Montenegrin independence from Austria, the king found the prospect of independent Montenegro intangible, foreseeing the brutal suppression of the rebellions in the near future. With Serbia and other Slavic potential allies unable to assist Montenegro, Michael I signed the Treaty of Nikšić, granting Montenegro autonomy under the Habsburg crown, allowing Michael I to be crowned as King of Montenegro, the first since the end of the Weltkrieg.\nWhile his reign has been seen as a beacon of stability for Montenegro, the two nationalist People's Parties of Montenegro work with and against him, in an attempt to secure full Montenegrin independence. Michael I must tread the waters carefully, working with both the Serbs of the People's Party, and anti-Austrian Montenegrins of the True People's Party."

MNT_dynastic_issues:0 "Dynastic Issues"
MNT_dynastic_issues_desc:0 "The house of Petrović-Njegoš, while undisputed as the ruling house of the Kingdom of Montenegro, has been in open conflict with the People's Party, and furthermore the Serbian royal houses. The Serbian royals have been trying for decades, even preceding the Weltkrieg, to depose the ruling house of Petrović-Njegoš and emplace their own Serbian dynasty, seeing it as a threat to the now nearly extinct idea of Yugoslavism.\nEven with the answering of the Yugoslav question, Serbian monarchs still see Montenegro as easy access to the Mediterranean, making cooperation difficult."
MNT_serb_separatism:0 "Serb Separatism"
MNT_serb_separatism_desc:0 "Following the victory of the Central Powers over the Entente, and the subsequent partition and occupation of the Kingdoms of Serbia and Montenegro, Montenegro's two nationalist political parties, the People's Parties, have been at odds with each other trying to decide what to do with Montenegro. The People's Party sees Montenegrins as being Serbs from Serbia, while on the contrary, the True People's Party sees the Montenegrins as Serbs from Montenegro. Militant nationalists, meanwhile, following the brutal South Slavic Revolts, have occupied a large portion of Northern Montenegro, much to the displeasure of Austria and Montenegro themselves.\n These nationalist strongholds have been a serious thorn in both the Illyrian and Montenegrin sides."
MNT_shackled_economy:0 "Shackled Economy"
MNT_shackled_economy_desc:0 "In 1929, during the South Slavic Revolts, Vienna struck a deal with Montenegrin revolutionaries: autonomy and the king for peace. This was accepted, as Montenegrins needed a strong position against Serbia. However, over the next seven years, Montenegro has found itself chained to the markets of Vienna.\nSuch a position is obviously untenable, and should be rectified soon."

MNT_the_great_balancing_act:0 "The Great Balancing Act"
MNT_the_great_balancing_act_desc:0 "With the situation in Austria occupying their time, now, if we wish to make moves, now is that time."
MNT_treading_carefully:0 "To Tread Carefully"
MNT_treading_carefully_desc:0 "The Klubaši are Serb-oriented, viewing Montenegrins as Serbs from Serbia. They could, however, protect Montenegro..."
MNT_old_pravasi_friends:0 "Trust the Pravaši"
MNT_old_pravasi_friends_desc:0 "The Pravaši sees Montenegro as Serbs from Montenegro. If we are to split from Austria, this shall secure our sovereignty."
MNT_independence_and_cordiality:0 "Independence and Cordiality"
MNT_independence_and_cordiality_desc:0 "Why should we change our course? Austria has given us what we have desired."
MNT_export_bauxite_stash:0 "Red Bauxite Shipping"
MNT_export_bauxite_stash_desc:0 "Montenegro is home to a large stash of bauxite. We must excavate it to pull a profit."
MNT_expand_the_sawmills:0 "Sawmills of the Woodlands"
MNT_expand_the_sawmills_desc:0 "Northern Montenegro is covered by woodland. With a need for materials at home, cutting these trees will heavily assist."
MNT_study_austrian_boats:0 "Reverse Engineer Warships"
MNT_study_austrian_boats_desc:0 "We have a few spare Austrian naval ships. We must disassemble them to figure out how they work."
MNT_nationalize_austrian_industries:0 "Nationalize Austrian Monopolies"
MNT_nationalize_austrian_industries_desc:0 "Austria holds our economy under lock and key. We may use a crowbar, to take our economy back."
MNT_third_great_danubian_port:0 "Grandeur of the Port"
MNT_third_great_danubian_port_desc:0 "Podgorica is a vital route for trade in the Adriatic. Its integrity must be ensured for profit to continue."
MNT_mobilize_for_action:0 "No Negotiating with Terrorists"
MNT_mobilize_for_action_desc:0 "The Serbian terrorists in the north, along with the radical Montenegrins, need to be cast out from this plain."
MNT_trade_treaty_serbia:0 "Podgorica Highway Agreement"
MNT_trade_treaty_serbia_desc:0 "We shall reach out to Serbia, and pave a larger highway from Belgrade to Podgorica."
MNT_trade_treaty_bulgaria:0 "Defensive Trade Diplomacy"
MNT_trade_treaty_bulgaria_desc:0 "The enemy of my enemy is my friend. This description fits Bulgaria, so by paving a road through it and Albania, we may enrich both of ourselves."
MNT_montenegrin_domestic_minerals:0 "Form the UZI" #Recovery Excavation Association
MNT_montenegrin_domestic_minerals_desc:0 "Besides bauxite, we have stashes of iron. The UZI, or Recovery Excavation Association, shall be created to look for the missing minerals."
MNT_prospect_for_coal:0 "Assist Elektroprivreda Crne Gore"
MNT_prospect_for_coal_desc:0 "Elektroprivreda Crne Gore is Montenegro's electric company. With Black Monday, it has suffered a large hit. We need to lend it a helping hand."

MNT_back_on_track:0 "Back on Track"
MNT_back_on_track_desc:0 "Montenegro's economy is back to its pre-crisis level, and is rising quite quickly for such a small nation."

MNT_any_trade_partners:0 "Open Ports Policy"
MNT_any_trade_partners_desc:0 "Our nation is rather new and as such nobody quite knows what to make of us. This means we are politically isolated on the world stage, which is dangerous for a small nation like ours in such a volatile region like the Balkans.To help establish new ties to the great powers both in Europe and across the seas we shall open our port Podgorica to all, no matter their political leanings. Some say this is dangerous but to survive we must take such risks."
MNT_defense_if_needed:0 "Armed Necessities Act"
MNT_defense_if_needed_desc:0 "Our new nation is defended by a miniscule army, though it is more like a militia than anything. To secure our borders we must expand the Army drastically and do so we shall pass the Armed Necessities Act that will divert funds from other projects into the military. This might have drawbacks to some economic and social sectors but none of our funding will matter no matter where it goes if some upstart state overruns us."
MNT_prioritize_montenegrin_companies:0 "Accentuate Domestic Business"
MNT_prioritize_montenegrin_companies_desc:0 "We are a poor people, neglected by all those who have ruled us. Now we are independent we can finally put Montenegrin money back into Montenegro. Our financial advisors have advised us that the most cost effective way to magnify our investments is investing in local business. This holds obvious merit so we shall begin to offer low cost loans to any and all businesses that need them. The money we put into these businesses then can be trickled down to the common man."
MNT_reintroduce_perper:0 "Reintroduce the Montenegrin Perper"
MNT_reintroduce_perper_desc:0 "Ever since the South Slavic Revolts our local currency, the Montenegrin Perper had been substituted for the Austrian krone in a flagrant attempt to suppress us. Now that we are free we cannot allow the Kaiser to have such leverage over us any more. We will begin to phase out the krone and reintroduce the perper at a new fixed rate for now. With this we will sever another tendril of Austrian influence."
MNT_overwrite_austrian_companies:0 "Overwrite Austrian Barons"
MNT_overwrite_austrian_companies_desc:0 "Our economy is dominated by Austrian businesses. These flagrant monopolies have all but strangled our local businesses in their cradle. We must decide what to do about them. Some suggest nationalizing them and cutting them up then selling them off. This would cut yet another foothold the Austrians have in our nation and give control of our economy back to ourselves. However, some caution against this saying it could easily backfire catastrophically and worsen the economic situation. Instead they suggest that we let the Austrians continue to operate but with harsher regulation to allow for local business growth. What are we to do?"
MNT_foreign_investment:0 "Nikšić Foreign Investiture"
MNT_foreign_investment_desc:0 "The Nikšić Bank is the first bank ever founded in Montenegro. To further boost the local economy we will encourage the bank to hand out private loans to average people who need it. It also will be allowed to look across borders to find foreign ventures it finds a good investment. "
MNT_bribe_serbs:0 "Placate the Klubaši"
MNT_bribe_serbs_desc:0 "The Klubaši, or Peoples Party, have not taken kindly to our reforms. They see our state, their state, as an abomination. They continue to push for our integration into Serbia. However, they are people just like us and just like us are vulnerable to gifts. In return for them not too loudly we will focus some investment in their strongholds. This obvious bribe will surely boost their chances in future elections, some warn, and if they take over then Montenegro’s days are numbered. Not only that but it might even embolden the Serb terrorists who plague the north of the country. However independence is fraught with risks, what is one more among thousands?"
MNT_podgorica_seaport:0 "The Podgorica Seaport"
MNT_podgorica_seaport_desc:0 "Our main harbor, the Podgorica Seaport, has become a trading hub along the Adriatic recently. Ships from America to Bombay stop to unload cargo and take more on. The sheer number of ships along with their increasing size has laid bare just how small the port is. If our meteoric economic growth is to continue we must expand it, so emergency modifications have been authorized for the port so it can accommodate more ships and bigger ships that continue to flow through."
MNT_lead_and_zinc:0 "Probe the Brskovo Mine"
MNT_lead_and_zinc_desc:0 "The Brskovo mine has been a rich source of lead and zinc for years now. However, recent surveys have indicated there might be still more veins that remain to be tapped. We have already been bombarded with requests to find these untapped veins and begin to mine them as well and we have little reason to oppose them."
MNT_northeast_livestocks:0 "Rapprochement with Berane Ranchers"
MNT_northeast_livestocks_desc:0 "The north of our country is crawling with Serbian terrorists who seek to destroy our nation as their long term goal. In the short term they have terrorized the landowners of Berane, stealing food and killing and burning livestock and crops. This has bred nothing but ill will between the victims and the government, who they see as doing nothing to stop this. In that sense they are right, we have done nothing to counter these terrorists. However we must get these landowners back on side if we are to maintain power and most importantly, prosperity. We shall meet these landowners and hear their concerns and address them in the best way we can."
MNT_business_of_balkans:0 "Business of the Balkans"
MNT_business_of_balkans_desc:0 "We are making money hand over fist. Trade is exploding across the nation and prosperity is slowly bringing us to a new standard of living unheard of just a decade before. We have been approached as an economic neutral ground for various Balkan states who officially hate each other but must still deal with each other. This reputation could mean big for us not only economically, but ensure our security as a Switzerland of the Balkans."
