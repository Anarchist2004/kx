### Ideas ###

GRE_memories_of_king: "Memories of the King"
GRE_memories_of_king_desc: "While Greece is still technically a monarchy, since the end of the Weltkrieg, her King has lived in exile with the Thunderbolt Regent ruling in his stead. When Kondylis first came to power, most monarchists expected him to restore King Alexander to his rightful throne. However, Kondylis refused, citing the instability of the Greek nation, saying the King returning would only make the situation worse, much to the chagrin of hardline Monarchists. To this day, hardline Monarchists and Republicans despise the Regent's government, and many are counting down the days to his death, which to them looks closer everyday..."
GRE_foreign_industry_GER1: "German-Owned Industry"
GRE_foreign_industry_GER1_desc: "Thanks to our incredible war debts after the end of the disastrous Weltkrieg, King Constantine signed a deal allowing German investors unfettered access to the Greek economy.

It is likely that the Regent-For-Life will continue ruling until his eventual death..."

POLITICS_KONDYLIS_DESC: "For the past ten years, Georgios "Thunderbolt" Kondylis has guided Greece as its eternal regent: a firm hand on the rudder of an often chaotic Greek state. Republican and Radical resentment hasn't been quashed so much as quieted after an abortive revolution in Thessalia, and many supporters of the King(s) wonder aloud when the "regent" will finally allow Greece's rightful rulers to return home. The fact that they're Germans should, of course, be forgotten. Yet, change is on the horizon. The thunderbolt general's health is failing. Kondylis has no clear successor, and the greats of Greek politics either live in exile or have already given up the ghost. What shall become of the Kingdom of the Hellenes?"

### Focuses ###
GRE_black_monday_focus: "Black Monday"
GRE_black_monday_focus_desc: "The Black Monday crisis has hit the Greek economy like a bull in a china shop, considering its domination by German businesses. It is time to take drastic action to resolve this crisis before it gets any worse."
GRE_farming_crisis: "The Farming Crisis"
GRE_farming_crisis_desc: "While the Greek economy saw strong industrial growth through the 19th century it remains primarily orientated on agriculture, and thus the sudden drop in agricultural exports has hit the country hard. Farmers are nearly at a point of rioting, and thus addressing the crisis tops our agenda."
GRE_foreign_industry_question: "Foreign-Owned Industries?"
GRE_foreign_industry_question_desc: "Much of Greece's industry is owned by foreigners, mainly in Germany and Austria. With the financial crisis, many of these factories have begun to shut their doors, expecting Greece to deal with the political fallout until such a time as the economy recovers. With so many industrial workers left unpaid and out on the street, we must do something about this."
GRE_board_of_industry: "The Board of Industry"
GRE_board_of_industry_desc: "A new government agency must be created in order to oversee an overhaul of some of Greece's rather outdated industrial laws and practices."
GRE_greek_mining: "Advancements in Mining"

GRE_land_reform: "Begin Land Reform"
GRE_land_reform_desc: "Many of the country's agricultural communes are still overseen by wealthy landlords, with the peasants treated practically as serfs.

GRE_privatize_industry: "Privatize Government Holdings"
GRE_privatize_industry_desc: "There are a number of government-run businesses and factories which would best work in the hands of private individuals.

GRE_nationalize_industry: "Nationalize Vital Companies"
GRE_nationalize_industry_desc: "Too many vital industries are ready to go bankrupt. Only the nation's government is organized and efficient enough to keep them afloat, at least until the crisis is passed and, in the meantime, they can keep the economy afloat and Greeks employed."
GRE_military_conversion: "Convert Military Factories"
GRE_military_conversion_desc: "There are a number of military factories which we must consider turning over to commercial use. It means Greece will be less prepared for war in the future, but there will be no Greece if it crumbles around us thanks to the crisis."
GRE_fund_business: "Take Out Loans"
GRE_fund_business_desc: "We cannot dig any deeper - the only way to bail Greece out of this crisis is to take out as many loans as we can afford, and channel that money into employment programs and funding the most promising companies willing to open new factories in Greece. It will hurt in the long run, but we have little choice."
GRE_recovery: "Full Recovery"
GRE_recovery_desc: "Our stimulus programs have begun to improve the economic prospects of the country for now, and the crisis is passed. Hopefully, the price we paid does not come back to haunt us."

GRE_monarchist_question: "The Remaining Monarchists"
GRE_monarchist_question_desc: "There are still many within the government, and especially the army, who yet hold loyalties to the monarchy.

GRE_monarchist_victory: "Monarchist Victory"
GRE_monarchist_victory_desc: "The kingdom shall be restored!

GRE_king_alexandros: "King Aléxandros"
GRE_king_alexandros_desc: "First crowned in 1917 and later exiled, King Alexander shall be returned to the throne. A moderate man used to being a figurehead, he shall serve as a constitutional monarch with only the minimum of formal powers."
GRE_republican_question: "The Remaining Republicans"
GRE_republican_question_desc: "With the king now back on the throne, a question lingers regarding what should be done with those who most oppose him and advocate a return to republican rule. The king advocates mercy, but would that only leave Greece to the possibility of more coups in the future?"
GRE_empower_the_throne: "Empower the Throne"
GRE_empower_the_throne_desc: "It seems Alexander has learned a thing or two in his exile and has been exerting his will on parliament more forcefully. He has garnered enough support to gain power enough to overrule the elected leaders when needed, making him far from the figurehead many assumed he would be."
GRE_king_georgios: "King Geórgios"
GRE_king_georgios_desc: "A military man from an early age, Prince George is the eldest son of the late King Constantine and shall create a strong monarchy along German lines, where the King serves as a brake on the powers of parliament."

#GRE_divine_mediator: "A Divine Mediator" already defined above as an idea
GRE_divine_mediator_desc: "The king stands as a divinely anointed ruler, chosen by both God and the people to defend them from radicalism and instability.

GRE_education_programs_desc: "Improving the literacy rate of the Greek population is of paramount importance, as is broadening the quality of education in general. We intend to found hundreds of new schools for this purpose, where the keen minds of new generations will thrive."
GRE_neuter_military: "Neuter Military"
GRE_neuter_military_desc: "By far the biggest threat to stability in Greece comes from the military, while we accept the need for the armed forces we must take steps to ensure their political neutrality and remove overly ambitious demagogues from the ranks."
GRE_strong_and_free: "Strong and Free"
GRE_strong_and_free_desc: "It may not always be wise to give power to the military, lest they abuse it, but without our army's strength we will never truly be independent. We must empower them and keep Greece both strong and free."

GRE_christian_unions: "Found Christian Unions"
GRE_christian_unions_desc: "Founding state-endorsed unions under the leadership of priests will allow us to prevent labour disputes from getting out of hand and becoming a threat to the safety of Greece.

GRE_export_focus_desc: "The Greek economy would be best served with a focus on exports, allowing cash to flow into the country and further develop her industries. To this end, we intend to raise industrial tariffs while seeking free trade arrangements for our agricultural produce."
GRE_auth_dems: "Néo Krátos"
GRE_auth_dems_desc: "The authoritarian, but still republican, New State have taken the lion's share of the influence in the new parliament. Fiercely anti-union and protectionist, their rule promises to take a firm hand to radicals if nothing else."

GRE_reverse_secularisation: "Reverse Secularisation"

### Events
gre.1.t: "The Thunderbolt Regency"
gre.1.d: "The years since Greece's loss in the Weltkrieg have seen little but upheaval and hardship. The loss of Crete and Macedonia to the Treaty of Salonika and crippling war debts to Austria and Germany sent King Alexander fleeing into exile as the Third Republic was declared... only to result in years of failed governments and coups until Georgios Kondylis took control in 1926 and declared himself the permanent Regent of Greece; its king still in exile. Republicans, Syndicalists, and Monarchists all resent the Regent’s reign. Only the loyalty of the officer corps has kept him in power. The arch-republican, Eleftherios Venizelos, waits in self-imposed exile in Vienna. Monarchists like Panagis Tsaldaris demand a plebiscite for the return of the King. Syndicalist workers’ unions are growing increasingly militant. Yet, for the moment, Greece remains in the iron grip of the Thunderbolt General."
gre.1.a: "Goodness!"
gre.2.t: "The Challenges Ahead"
gre.2.d: "The new republic, which faces its next election in 1938, faces several challenges before then: most prominent is the simmering resentment towards the loss of Greek territory. Most are certain that war is coming again soon, with many groups such as the syndicalist rebels and the looming figure of Ioannis Metaxas waiting for the first moment the government makes the slightest misstep. Monarchist sentiment is also on the rise, with many demanding that another referendum be held soon to determine whether the kingdom should be restored... even if republicans fear that doing so would only plunge the nation into anarchy yet again."
gre.2.a: "We shall not repeat past mistakes."
gre.3.t: "Independence Day"
gre.3.d: "In 1821, Greeks rose up against the oppressive Ottoman Empire, which had occupied Greece for nearly four hundred years. Bishop Germanos of Patras boldly raised the Greek flag at the monastery of Agia Lavras, inciting the Greek revolution. While the exact date probably was not March 25th, it did occur in late March and it was gradually associated with the religious feast of the Annunciation which occurs on the same date. On the day of the Feast of the Annunciation the archangel Gabriel appeared to the maiden Mary and announced the news, she was pregnant with the divine child. Bishop Germanos chose this day to deliver a different but not unrelated message, a new spirit was about to be born in Greece."
gre.3.a: "A new spirit shall be born again!"
gre.4.d: "Independence Day is celebrated once again in [Root.GetNameDef], with crowds lining the streets in Athens and other cities, all waving the Greek flag and singing 'Ýmnos is tin Eleftherían' - the Hymn to Freedom, and the country's national anthem. Despite all the hardship the country has faced, its people are still eager to celebrate their sense of independence from those who would oppress them."
gre.4.a: "Hail, o hail, Liberty!"
gre.5.t: "Black Monday hits Greece!"
gre.5.d: "The rapid German economic collapse has reached our nation! Our reliance on trade with Germany and Mitteleuropean dominance of our economy has exacerbated the crisis, with many German factories being instructed to shut down. Worse, the spread of the crisis has meant a lack of markets for our agricultural exports, and already farmers are facing a crisis where almost none of them can sell their crops. We must quickly work to address this crisis, lest it grow out of hand and sow chaos throughout our nation."
gre.5.a: "O Theós na mas voithísei!"
gre.6.t: "Responding to the Crisis"
gre.6.d: "With the number of farmers left holding crops and nowhere to sell them, we are left with a choice: either support them for the current year and encourage them to switch away from their reliance on exports, or dig deep into our pockets and support them fully until the economic crisis has passed."
gre.6.a: "Help them out as much as we can."
gre.6.b: "Dig deep - they're the backbone of Greece."
gre.7.t: "Foreign-Owned Industry"
gre.7.d: "Almost half of our economy is owned by investors in Germany and Austria, but after Black Monday many of their mines and factories have closed down - some because they have become unprofitable but others because the investors are trying to save money or have gone bankrupt. In either case, many thousands of Greeks have been put out of work. The suggestion is that we should seize these assets, or at least the worst cases, despite the Treaty of Salonika stipulating that we cannot. The only way to prevent a backlash from either country, however, is to subsidize the investors out of our own pocket... a deeply unpopular move if we attempted it, to be sure."
gre.7.a: "Seize it all, no matter the repercussions."
gre.7.b: "Deal with the worst cases only."
gre.7.c: "Subsidize the investors ourselves - they'd better be grateful."
gre.8.t: "Greece Seizes [Root.GetAdjective] Assets"
gre.8.d: "Thanks to the rippling effects of Black Monday, [Root.GetAdjective] investors who held majority shares in Greek factories and mines have been closing those businesses down - in some cases because they're unprofitable, but in others because the investors have gone bankrupt. The Greek government has responded by seizing the companies, despite the Treaty of Salonika signed after the war stipulating that our investors have unfettered access to their economy. Many in the government are suggesting we respond harshly, and not only apply sanctions but pull all investment out of [From.GetNameDef] altogether. Others say the country is only trying to stay afloat - Black Monday has hit all of us hard."
gre.8.a: "Apply sanctions and pull all business out at once."
gre.8.b: "Just apply the sanctions and express our outrage."
gre.8.c: "Leave them be - we're all trying to cope."
gre.9.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Applies Harsh Sanctions"
gre.9.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has applied a range of economic sanctions in response to our contravention of the Treaty of Salonika - including pulling all assets out of the country, including those which were still operational - but thankfully has gone no further. The move will sting for a few years, to be sure, and has seriously soured relations between our countries."
gre.9.a: "It had to be done."
gre.10.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Applies Sanctions"
gre.10.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has applied a range of economic sanctions in response to our contravention of the Treaty of Salonika, but thankfully has gone no further. The move will sting for a few years, to be sure, and has soured relations between our countries."
gre.11.t: "Greece Seizes [Root.GetAdjective] Assets"
gre.11.d: "Thanks to the rippling effects of Black Monday, [Root.GetAdjective] investors who held majority shares in Greek factories and mines have been closing those businesses down - in some cases because they're unprofitable, but in others because the investors have gone bankrupt. The Greek government has responded by seizing many of the worst cases, despite the Treaty of Salonika signed after the war stipulating that our investors have unfettered access to their economy. Many in the government are suggesting we respond with sanctions, while others say the Greeks are simply doing what they have to in order to survive - they could, after all, have seized all investor assets if they'd wished, and not simply some."
gre.11.a: "Apply sanctions - they must be taught a lesson."
gre.12.t: "Monarchists Demand Referendum"
gre.12.d: "Several prominent aristocrats, led by the influential former general Ioannis Metaxas, today stormed Parliament and demanded the government begin a referendum on the future of the monarchy. They say the question must be settled once and for all, and the government has put it off for too long. Their position has gained considerable support among the people, as well."
gre.12.a: "Perhaps we should consider it?"
gre.13.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Leaves the [Root.GetFactionName]"
gre.13.d: "Evidently, the [From.GetAdjective] government has decided it has gotten all it required from their alliance with us, and have informed us that they are leaving the [Root.GetFactionName] effective immediately."
gre.13.a: "It was fun while it lasted."
gre.14.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks to Join the [Root.GetFactionName]"
gre.14.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] has sent a formal request, asking to be admitted into the [Root.GetFactionName]. Are they worth the possibility we might also get dragged into their struggles?"
gre.14.a: "Of course!"
gre.14.b: "They're more trouble than they're worth."
gre.15.t: "We are Part of the [From.GetFactionName]"
gre.15.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to admit us into their alliance. We are now officially part of the [From.GetFactionName]."
gre.15.a: "Excellent."
gre.16.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
gre.16.d: "Perhaps deciding we're more trouble than we're worth, the [From.GetAdjective] government has refused to admit us into the [From.GetFactionName]."
gre.16.a: "Ah well."
gre.17.t: "Massive Demonstrations Against the Government"
gre.17.d: "The country's loss in the war has triggered demonstrations across [Root.GetNameDef], all calling for the government to step down immediately. Indeed, it is apparent that forces are beginning to array themselves to take control of the country by force if the government does not step down, and the fear is that the country is on the verge of civil war."
gre.17.a: "This is a disaster!"
gre.18.t: "The Government Nears Collapse"
gre.18.d: "Demonstrations have continued against the government, with the situation having finally reached a critical mass. If the government doesn't step down immediately, radical elements could take control, or the country could completely dissolve into chaos."
gre.18.a: "Forces loyal to Ioannis Metaxas take over to maintain order."
gre.18.b: "Aris Velouchiotis wrests control in a coup."
gre.18.c: "The army takes control, promising free and democratic elections."
gre.18.e: "The King abdicates the throne, restoring the republic."
gre.18.f: "The government steps down, promising immediate elections."
gre.19.t: "The Death of Ioannis Metaxas"
gre.19.d.ishos: "President Ioannis Metaxas, leader of [Root.GetNameDef], died today of a phlegmon of the pharynx. He has been succeeded by Alexandros Koryzis, his chosen successor, though many fear Koryzis cannto hope to match Metaxas's personal magnetism and military record. While Metaxas was considered a controversial figure by many, people still lined the streets throughout the country to mourn the man's death."
gre.19.d.nothos: "Former general Ioannis Metaxas, a war hero and politician renowned for his strong beliefs, died today of a phlegmon of the pharynx. While Metaxas was considered a controversial figure by many, people still lined the streets throughout the country to mourn the man's death."
gre.19.a: "He shall be remembered."
gre.20.t: "The Death of Alexandros Papanastasiou"
gre.20.d.ishos: "Prime Minister Alexandros Papanastasiou died today of a sudden heart attack. As the nation mourns his passing, former general Nikolaos Plastiras has taken over his duties as well as leadership of the National Unionist Party."
gre.20.d.nothos: "Alexandros Papanastasiou, leader of the National Unionist Party, died today of a sudden heart attack. Former general Nikolaos Plastiras has taken over leadership of the party, and gave a speech in Athens today honouring the man who, in his words, 'served [GRE.GetNameDef] until his last breath'."
gre.20.a: "A fine man."
gre.21.t: "Kostas Gavriilides Steps Down"
gre.21.d.ishos: "Kostas Gavriilides, long-time leader of the radical Rural Democratic Front and president of [Root.GetNameDef], today stepped down from his position to retire. After a debate within the party, leadership has been passed to Gavriilides's chosen successor, Nikos Ploumpidis."
gre.21.d.nothos: "Kostas Gavriilides, long-time leader of the radical Rural Democratic Front, today stepped down from his position to retire. After a debate within the party, leadership has been passed to Gavriilides's chosen successor, Nikos Ploumpidis."
gre.21.a: "OK."
gre.22.t: "The Papandreou Scandal"
gre.22.d: "A number of government ministers have been caught up in a corruption scandal, revealed by the press, but the nation was shocked today to learn that Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou also stands accused. While it seems there is insufficient evidence for formal charges to be laid, the scandal has been enough for the New Liberal Coalition to consider whether Papandreou should continue as the party leader."
gre.22.a: "Panagiotis Kanellopoulos wrests control of the party."
gre.22.b: "Papandreou holds onto leadership after a narrow vote."
gre.23.t: "The Death of Themistoklis Soufilis"
gre.23.d.ishos: "Prime Minister Themistoklis Soufilis died today, his health having suffered since taking power in the last election. Though most in the government were unsurprised, having expected this for months, the nation was overcome with shock and mourners have lined the streets in Athens. Leadership of his wing of the Liberal Party has fallen to his deputy, Konstantinos Tsatsos."
gre.23.d.nothos: "Themistoklis Soufilis died today, his health having suffered since the last election. Though most in the Liberal Party were unsurprised, having expected this for months, the nation greeted the news with shock and mourners have lined the streets in Athens.

gre.23.a: "He shall be missed."
gre.24.t: "The Death of Panagis Tsaldaris"
gre.24.d: "Panagis Tsaldaris, leader of the Peoples' Party, died today as a result of a degenerative health condition which has plagued him since assuming leadership of the party several years ago.

gre.51.t: "National Elections of [GetYear]"
gre.51.d.noban: "With the socialist agrarians having gained considerable headway, absorbing much of the remaining anti-monarchist sentiment, the traditional political parties may be hard-pressed to win in today's election."
gre.51.d.ban: "The ban on the socialist agrarians taking part in the elections has made some decree it an illegitimate one, yet even so the Greek people have assembled at the polls to select a new government."
gre.51.a: "The Peoples' Party wins."
gre.51.b: "The Rural Democratic Front is victorious."

gre.100.t: "The Referendum Begins"
gre.100.d: "Word has been sent out to former King Alexander, currently in exile along with the rest of the royal family, that the referedum on the future of the monarchy has begun. Already lines have been drawn, with the pro-republicans and the pro-monarchists attempting to convince anyone and everyone of how to vote. It will be a difficult couple of months until the vote is actually held, and expectations are high that it will not be a peaceful time for Greece."
gre.100.a: "Let's hope there's no trouble..."
gre.101.t: "Monarchists in the Streets"
gre.101.d: "The pro-monarchist forces are busily campaigning in the streets of Athens and other Greek cities, handing out pamphlets which suggest the government has not done its job and is in need of a king to watch over us. They are gaining considerable traction, and some are suggesting that we should make efforts to shut them down before their actions grow out of hand."
gre.101.a: "Allow them to distribute their pamphlets."
gre.101.b: "We must suppress this nonsense."
gre.102.t: "The Republican Campaign"
gre.102.d: "There are a number of advisers in the government growing nervous at the prospect of a monarchist victory. They are suggesting we should consider funding a campaign of our own, in favour of republicanism - quietly, of course, so not to draw undue suspicion that we are exerting too much influence on the results. This is, however, exactly what they want."
gre.102.a: "Yes, we should fund this effort."
gre.102.b: "No, we should not get involved."
gre.102.c: "Discourage this talk within our government."
gre.103.t: "Aristocratic Lobbying"
gre.103.d: "Reports have it that a large number of wealthy Greek aristocrats are busily buying up influence within the government, what they call 'lobbying'... and, it's said, with the assistance of the influential Ioannis Metaxas, who himself has weighed heavily in favour of the monarchy's restoration. If we allow this influence-peddling to continue, the monarchists will definitely gain an advantage in the upcoming referendum."
gre.103.a: "We'll allow it."
gre.103.b: "Place a moratorium on this 'lobbying'"
gre.104.t: "The Syndicalist Rally"
gre.104.d: "Small rallies have been held throughout the north by the syndicalists, with a huge rally apparently planned for tomorrow in the city of Athens - with the charismatic Nikos Zachariadis, leader of the Kinonikó Ergatikó Kómma, said to be preparing a fiery speech against the monarchy and all it stands for. There are fears that Zachariadis might do more than stir up republican support, however, and also gain plenty of support for his own revolutionary ideas."
gre.104.a: "Allow the rally to proceed."
gre.104.b: "Send in the police to break it up, by force if necessary."
gre.105.t: "Monarchist Riot"
gre.105.d: "Rioting has broken out in Athens after fears by monarchist supporters that they will lose the upcoming referendum were followed by accusations that our government was attempting to rig it. There has been considerable damage, and a large number of assaults on republican supporters and their headquarters. If we don't do something soon, the damage done to the republican cause will be significant."
gre.105.a: "Keep it contained, but use leniency."
gre.105.b: "Shut this down with extreme prejudice."
gre.106.t: "Republican Riot"
gre.106.d: "Rioting has broken out in Athens after fears by republican supporters that they will lose the upcoming referendum were followed by accusations that our government was attempting to rig it. There has been considerable damage, and a large number of assaults on several aristocrats as well as monarchist supporters and their headquarters. If we don't do something soon, the damage done to the monarchist cause will be significant."
gre.107.t: "Monarchists Have the Advantage"
gre.107.d: "The sentiment within Greece in the lead up to the referendum appears to be favouring the monarchists. Some are suggesting that, if the government were to intervene and rig the referendum, now would be the time to begin. The more popular the monarchists become, the less likely the rigging would be successfully kept secret, but advisers say that the alternative is that the monarchists might win."
gre.107.a: "We need to rig the outcome in favour of the republic."
gre.107.b: "Might win? We must rig the referendum to ensure it!"
gre.107.c: "Do nothing - we will accept the legitimate results."
gre.108.t: "Republicans Have the Advantage"
gre.108.d: "The sentiment within Greece in the lead up to the referendum appears to be favouring the republicans.

gre.109.t: "Voting Begins"
gre.109.d: "Today, all throughout Greece, voting has begun on the referendum to determine the future of the Fourth Republic. King Alexander is on-hand in Athens, having returned to the country for the first time since his exile, though it will be several days until the final results are tallied."

gre.110.a: "Republicans."
gre.110.b: "Monarchists."
gre.111.t: "Republican Victory"
gre.111.d: "The question of the monarchy's future has finally been settled, and the answer is that the Fourth Republic will live on. The king and the rest of the royal family will return to exile, and while it will take some time for the republic's strength to be solidified, for now it seems the debate is finally over."
gre.111.a: "Long live the Republic of Greece!"
gre.112.t: "Monarchist Victory"
gre.112.d: "The question of the republic's future has finally been settled, and it is with celebration throughout the country that its people welcome back the royal family. There is, however, already disagreement on who should assume the throne: should it be King Alexander, the unpopular younger brother who ascended to the throne after his father and brother were originally exiled, or Prince George, the brother who should have been the heir and yet has never been king? Alexander is considered the more moderate and legitimate choice, considering George's autocratic tendencies, but George is clearly the popular favourite."
gre.112.a: "We will need to decide soon."
gre.113.t: "Rigging Suspected"
gre.113.d.monarchist: "While the monarchists proved victorious in the referendum, there are many republicans who suspect the government of rigging the results... enough so that crowds of their supporters have poured into the streets throughout the nation to demand an investigation. Syndicalist leader Nikos Zachariadis is spearheading these demands, and many fear that if the slightest bit of evidence is uncovered of deceit, that will be enough of a spark to allow the syndicalists to overthrow the government in a popular coup."

gre.113.a: "The rigging is discovered!"
gre.113.b: "No evidence is uncovered and the protests die down."
gre.114.t: "The Metaxas Coup"
gre.114.d: "Our worst fears have been realized: the attempt to rig the election in favour of the republicans has been discovered, with several government officials having gone public with the proof. Riots have spread throughout the country, and former General Ioannis Metaxas has stepped in to take over. He and numerous army supporters have stormed parliament, arresting government leaders and declaring Metaxas as interim President and dictator."

gre.115.d: "Our worst fears have been realized: the attempt to rig the election in favour of the monarchy has been discovered, with several government officials having gone public with the proof.

He and numerous army supporters have stormed parliament, arresting government leaders and declaring Nikos Zachariadis as interim President and dictator. While there is some resistance, the rage at the government's actions has made it so that the syndicalists have more support than they would otherwise have enjoyed."
gre.116.t: "Coup in Greece"
gre.116.d.metaxas: "With confidence in the Greek government having reached a new low, and riots spreading throughout the country, former General Ioannis Metaxas has stepped in to assume control, seizing the Parliament in Athens and declaring himself dictator. He has also declared Greece to be free of [Root.GetAdjective] rule, vowing to fight any reprisal should it come."
gre.116.d.syndicalist: "With confidence in the Greek government having reached a new low, and riots spreading throughout the country, syndicalist strongman Athanasios Klaras has stepped in to assume control, seizing the Parliament in Athens and declaring Nikos Zachariadis and the syndicalist communes as the leaders of the new republic. He has also declared Greece to be free of [Root.GetAdjective] rule, vowing to fight any reprisal should it come."
gre.116.a: "They cannot escape so easily."
gre.116.b: "We have little choice but to let them be."
gre.117.t: "The Monarchist Question"
gre.117.d: "There is no question that the monarchists lost the referendum. It is, however, not the first time - they'll be back eventually, unless we can make sure that this is the last time they'll think of raising the question. Some are suggesting we begin a purge of all remaining or suspected monarchists from the government and army. Others, however, say we should take a softer approach lest our attempt to strengthen the republic weaken it instead."
gre.117.a: "Purging them is the only way."
gre.117.b: "Let them remain - the question is settled."
gre.118.t: "The Republican Question"
gre.118.d: "There is no question that the republicans lost the referendum. It is, however, not the first time - they'll be back eventually, unless we can make sure that this is the last time they'll think of raising the question. Some are suggesting we begin a purge of all remaining or suspected republicans from the government and army. Others, however, say we should take a softer approach lest our attempt to strengthen the republic weaken it instead."
gre.119.t: "Rise of the Agrarians"
gre.119.d: "With the monarchist now solidly in control of the nation, those who remain loyal to republican values have begun turning away from liberal parties - and instead have turned to the socialist agrarians under the Rural Democratic Front. Their fortunes have been especially buoyed by endorsements from Greek syndicalists, who see gathering together under the agrarian banner as the only way of defeating the monarchists and conservatives now in control of the nation. Rural Democratic Front leaders have been courting the moderate left in recent weeks, and if they succeed then the agrarians will pose a potent force in the upcoming election."
gre.119.a: "Rather worrying..."
gre.119.b: "Ban them from the elections."
gre.120.t: "A Liberal and Socialist Coalition"
gre.120.d: "While there were fears that the moderate socialists would agree to ally with the hardline agrarians, those fears appear to have been unfounded. Today the National Unionist Party announced a coalition with the Liberal Party, with Georgios Papandreou and Nikolaos Plastiras reportedly having hashed out a deal to form a united cabinet. This will blunt the efforts of the Rural Democratic Front, and possibly poses a threat to the Peoples' Party in the next election."
gre.120.a: "Interesting."
gre.121.t: "The Left Unites"
gre.121.d: "In response to the republican control over [GRE.GetNameDef], parties across the left of the spectrum have united under syndicalist leader Nikos Zachariadis, who intends to run in the upcoming election - and with support from moderate socialists, stands to pose a serious threat. Already there is talk within the government regarding whether the syndicalists should be banned, although their popularity indicates that would instantly throw the nation into civil war if attempted."
gre.121.a: "They can't win anyhow."
gre.121.b: "Ban them from the elections."
gre.122.t: "The Syndicalists Rise Up"
gre.122.d: "Having been banned from Greek elections, the left has gathered its supporters together in the north and started a campaign to take over [Root.GetNameDef]. The civil war has begun!"
gre.122.a: "They will regret this."
gre.123.t: "The Syndicalists are Victorious"
gre.123.d: "We can no longer resist the syndicalists. Our forces have begun laying down their arms and surrendering en masse. It appears another nation has fallen to tyranny."
gre.123.a: "A sad day..."
gre.124.t: "We Are Alone"
gre.124.d: "[GRE.GetNameDefCap] is no more, and we now stand alone. This is victory, of a sort."
gre.124.a: "We'll take it!"
gre.126.t: "The Civil War is Over"
gre.126.d: "The war with [GRE.GetNameDef] has been forced to end, and thus so has our rebellion."
gre.126.a: "Alas"
gre.150.t: "The First Hellenic Congress"
gre.150.d: "Syndicalists and trade union leaders from across the country met in Athens this week to discuss the future of [Root.GetNameDef]. Where does it belong in the international socialist community? How will its economy be restructured? What is to be done about the remaining republicans and monarchists who will surely struggle against the new order? In the end, the congress turned into a struggle between two men: the acting chairman, Nikos Zachariadis, and the charismatic general, Aris Velouchiotis. Velouchiotis's vision for Greece is much less forgiving, and far more geared towards turning the country into a military power, while Zachariadis argues that path will destroy Greece in the end."
gre.150.a: "Zachariadis remains in control."
gre.150.b: "Aris Velouchiotis commands the room, in the end."
gre.151.t: "Establishing the Communes"
gre.151.d: "While the unions are certainly willing, changing the entire [Root.GetAdjective] economy to a socialist model will be a challenge. Some are suggesting that no mercy be shown - swift industrialisation is a necessary goal of the communes, and anyone who doesn't comply quickly enough should be punished. Others say that a more diplomatic tactic is needed: work with the capitalists and convince them the communes will benefit them, and use incentives to win them over. Still others say it is the unions who should lead the way - bring them more directly into the government, and prove to the country that the communes are a government by the worker."
gre.151.a: "Expand the industrial base, regardless of the cost."
gre.151.b: "Ease the country into this, with incentives."
gre.151.c: "The unions must drive this change - let them take charge."
gre.152.t: "Rebuilding the Nation"
gre.152.d: "The capitalists of Greece have been beaten into submission, and now all that remains is to rebuild the country's economy from the ground up. For that, the government is turning to the Dioitikis - the leader - for direction on what should be the main priority moving forward."
gre.152.a: "We must build our military power."
gre.152.b: "A strong civilian industry will be our foundation."
gre.152.c: "Unity is more important than the economy."
gre.153.t: "Unions March in Thessalia"
gre.153.d: "The effects of Black Monday are being felt throughout Greece, but the hard-hit industrial workers are now marching in the streets in protest. In Thessalia, the crowds are especially large, spurred on by union leaders as well as the charismatic syndicalist spokesman, Nikos Zachariadis. The syndicalists are gaining a ready audience, and many in the government are suggesting that we crack down on them hard before they have a further chance to spread more sedition."
gre.153.a: "Crack down on these rabble-rousers."
gre.153.b: "Keep them contained, but we want no violence."
gre.154.t: "The Farming Crisis"
gre.154.d: "A great deal of Greece's economy relies on agricultural exports - and thus, with the collapse of European markets following the onset of Black Monday, a huge number of Greek farmers are left with crops they cannot sell. Not only does this put them in an immediate crisis, Greece will feel the effects for years to come if too many of the communes fold now. Thousands of farmers are marching in the streets, with radical agrarian sentiment running high."
gre.154.a: "This isn't good..."
gre.155.t: "The Santos Plot"
gre.155.d: "Greek leader Aris Velouchiotis is many things, but a leader who unites people is not one of them. There has been many conflicts within the government, the most serious one being a growing division between Velouchiotis and party official Georgios Santos. Recently it was revealed that Santos and a cadre of fellows hatched a scheme to have Velouchiotis ousted as leader, though Velouchiotis is unlikely to go quietly..."
gre.155.a: "Georgios Santos takes over party leadership."
gre.155.b: "Santos is executed - Aris Velouchiatis rules."
gre.156.t: "The Second Hellenic Congress"
gre.156.d: "Syndicalists and trade union leaders from across the country met in Athens this week to vote on the chairmanship, with Nikos Zachariadis this time challenged by longtime party member Konstantinos Speras. Speras is said to be a more moderate choice, attracting many of the less radical syndicalists who feel a hard line is no longer necessary in [GRE.GetNameDef]."
gre.156.a: "Zachariadis ushers in a new cabinet and retains control."
gre.156.b: "Konstantinos Speras wins the most votes and becomes chairman."
gre.157.t: "The Third Hellenic Congress"
gre.157.d.zach: "As the third syndicalist congress begins, Nikos Zachariadis announced that he would not be running again for the chairmanship - a surprise to many, considering how popular the man remains. While many consider the congress a sad farewell to their leader, the delegates now must choose his replacement: either the moderate Konstantinos Speras, running once again, or the new and charismatic upstart, Nikos Beloyannis."
gre.157.d.notzach: "Syndicalists and trade union leaders from across the country met in Athens this week to vote on the chairmanship, with Konstantinos Speras challenged by young an charismatic upstart Nikos Beloyannis - who has already won over a large number of delegates despite his age."
gre.157.a: "Konstantinos Speras maintains control."
gre.157.b: "Konstantinos Speras wins the majority of the vote."
gre.157.c: "Upstart Nikos Beloyannis wins over the council."
gre.158.t: "Metaxas Makes his Move"
gre.158.d: "Refusing to accept the conversion of Greece into a socialist state, Ioannis Metaxas has gathered together a large number of loyal soldiers and generals and started a rebellion in the north. His intention is to forcibly overthrow the government and return it to its 'natural' state."
gre.158.a: "He must be stopped!"
gre.159.t: "Metaxas Victorious"
gre.159.d: "We can no longer resist Metaxas and his supporters. Our forces have begun laying down their arms and surrendering en masse. It appears another free nation has fallen to tyranny."
gre.159.a: "A sad day for us all."
gre.160.t: "We Are Alone"
gre.160.d: "[GRE.GetNameDefCap] is no more, and we now stand alone. This is victory, of a sort."
gre.160.a: "We'll take it!"
gre.161.t: "[GRR.GetNameDef]"
gre.161.d: "The preparations are over. The time has come for us to march against [GRE.GetNameDef]!"
gre.161.a: "Se be it!"
gre.200.t: "Diplomatic Overtures from [GRE.GetNameDef]"
gre.200.d: "While our relations with the Greeks have been cool at best since their rebellion from Turkish rule in the 19th century, today we received several emissaries from [GRE.GetNameDef] who are hopeful to start a new era of peace between our nations - perhaps even going so far as to eventually work out an exchange of land and people, without the need to resort to further war. For today, however, they Greeks are looking for an indication that we might be open to such talks in the future."
gre.200.a: "We welcome better relations with the Greeks."
gre.200.b: "No, we've no need for this."
gre.201.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
gre.201.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government appears to be open to peaceful discussion with [GRE.GetNameDef], and has indicated a willingness to talk about more co-operation in the future."
gre.201.a: "That is a relief."
gre.202.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
gre.202.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has rejected our peaceful emissaries, and appears to have no interest in any further talks with [GRE.GetNameDef]."
gre.202.a: "So much for diplomacy."
gre.203.t: "A Treaty with [GRE.GetNameDef]?"
gre.203.d: "For several weeks now, [Root.GetAdjective] officials have been in talks with emissaries from [GRE.GetNameDef] about the possibility of a treaty of co-operation. This would mean an end to hostilities with the Greeks, and a sorting out of our differences. What the Greeks are asking for is this: we give them any states integral to their country, and they give us ours, while each of us give up any claims to other territories. We also begin an exchange of population, with Turks in [GRE.GetNameDef] coming to [Root.GetNameDef] but our much greater number of Greeks leaving for their country. In exchange, they will sign a pact of non-aggression, and we will do the same. The disruption caused by such a massive displacement of people will be considerable...but perhaps it might be worth it, in the end?"
gre.203.a: "We agree to their terms."
gre.203.b: "We agree to everything but surrendering land."
gre.203.c: "No, they are asking for far too much."
gre.204.t: "The Turks Refuse to Surrender Land"
gre.204.d: "After weeks of discussion, the [From.GetAdjective] government has stated it would agree to an exchange of populations between our countries, and also make a pledge of non-aggression...but under no circumstances will they turn over land we believe is rightfully ours. Is it worth agreeing to the rest of the treaty, knowing that our mutual claims could very well lead us back to war in time anyway?"
gre.204.a: "Then there's no deal."
gre.204.b: "Very well, we'll work with that."
gre.205.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
gre.205.d: "We did our best to conclude the deal, but without agreeing to exchange the territories the Greeks see no point in pursuing a treaty of non-aggression."
gre.205.a: "So be it!"
gre.206.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
gre.206.d: "The Greeks have agreed to our modified deal. It may mean we'll end up back at each other's throats in time, but for now there will be peace...and once the disruption caused by the exchange of population is over, chances are [Root.GetNameDef] will experience far fewer internal problems caused by their presence."
gre.206.a: "Excellent."
gre.207.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
gre.207.d: "After weeks of negotiation, the [From.GetAdjective] government finally ended the talks with [Root.GetNameDef] and no treaty worked out. There were simply too many points of contention that [From.GetNameDef] was unwilling to budge on, and se we leave empty handed."
gre.207.a: "It was worth the attempt."
gre.208.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
gre.208.d: "After weeks of negotiation, we have come to an agreement with [From.GetNameDef] on a treaty between our nations. A pledge of non-aggression has already been signed, and within a month's time the exchange of populations will begin. This will mean a large number of people coming into [Root.GetNameDef]. We will need to be ready for a great deal of disruption."
gre.208.a: "We will gladly welcome them home."
gre.210.t: "The Exchange Begins"
gre.210.d: "The population exchange between [Root.GetNameDef] and [GRE.GetNameDef] has begun, with thousands of Turks arriving daily...but many more Greeks leaving. The disruption is worse than we imagined, and there is a considerable amount of looting occurring in the homes left behind by the Greeks. Many of the refugees are reportedly starving or becoming ill en route, considering some have no means of transportation other than to walk to [GRE.GetNameDef] on foot or to take ramshackle boats across the Aegean. Authorities are already moving in to try and keep order where they can, and ideally this will sort itself out in time."
gre.210.a: "It's for the best."
gre.211.d: "The population exchange between [turks.GetNameDef] and [GRE.GetNameDef] has begun, with thousands of Turks leaving daily...but many more Greeks arriving. The disruption is worse than we imagined, and there is a considerable amount of looting occurring in the homes left behind by the Turks. Many of the refugees are reportedly starving or becoming ill en route, considering some have no means of transportation other than to walk to [GRE.GetNameDef] on foot or to take ramshackle boats across the Aegean. Authorities are already moving in to try and keep order where they can, and ideally this will sort itself out in time."
gre.212.t: "Stability Restored"
gre.212.d: "The population exchange is now a year in the past, and finally the dust appears to have settled and the refugees that returned to [Root.GetNameDef] have acclimated to their new homes."
gre.212.a: "That's finally over, then?"
gre.213.t: "Mission from [GRE.GetNameDef]"
gre.213.d: "The [GRE.GetAdjective] ambassador has been in talks with [Root.GetAdjective] officials over the past several weeks, attempting to foster better relations and more mutual cooperation between our nations. While some in the government are suspicious of their motives, it does appear as if their intentions are nothing more than to foster greater peace in the region."
gre.213.a: "Yes, let's work more closely with the Greeks."
gre.213.b: "No, there's no need for this."
gre.214.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
gre.214.d: "After discussions between the [Root.GetAdjective] ambassador and the [From.GetAdjective] government, they have agreed to increase ties between our nations."
gre.214.a: "Well done!"
gre.215.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
gre.215.d: "It appears that suspicions between the nations of the Balkans runs too deeply. The [From.GetAdjective] government listened to our ambassador and made non-committal noises of agreement...but nothing has come of it, and relations between our countries remains unchanged."
gre.215.a: "Too bad."
gre.216.t: "Greater Balkans Cooperation"
gre.216.d: "Our efforts to foster better relations with other countries in the Balkans has paid off - namely with greater investment in [Root.GetNameDef] and greater confidence amongst our citizens that peace will be maintained."
gre.216.a: "Good to hear."
gre.250.t: "[GRE.GetNameDefCap] Resurrects Megali Idea"
gre.250.d: "The Greeks have become increasingly revanchist over the last several months, making motions at resurrecting the 'Megali Idea' which aims at reclaiming ethnically Greek - but goes far beyond their traditional territory, including [773.GetName] and the western coast of Anatolia, which are primarily Turkish. We can warn them to abandon these rash claims entirely or go along with them, even though it likely means dragging the [Root.GetFactionName] into their war."
gre.250.a: "We support them, no matter what"
gre.250.b: "This is unacceptable - they either desist or they go"
gre.251.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Supports Us"
gre.251.d: "While some were nervous that [From.GetNameDef] would refuse to be dragged into an irredentist war with us, that has not proven to be the case. The [From.GetAdjective] government has declared their support for us, and - as our ally - will be there for whatever war we decide to pursue."
gre.251.a: "Excellent"
gre.252.t: "A Warning from [From.GetNameDef]"
gre.252.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has gotten wind of our intention to reclaim ethnically Greek lands in Anatolia, and informed us in no uncertain terms that, if we do not abandon all our claims immediately, we will pursue our wars outside of the [From.GetAdjective] alliance."
gre.252.a: "Then Megali dies here"
gre.252.b: "Then we are on our own"
gre.253.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Leaves the [Root.GetFactionName]"
gre.253.d.allies: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has decided to abandon the [Root.GetFactionName] and pursue its reckless claims on Greek territory... which includes our own allies. Whether this means war with [From.GetNameDef] remains to be seen."
gre.253.d.noallies: "Despite our warning, the [From.GetAdjective] government has decided to abandon the [Root.GetFactionName] and pursue its reckless claims on Greek territory."
gre.253.a: "Good luck with that!"
gre.254.t: "The Greeks Offer Peace"
gre.254.d: "We are losing the war with the Greeks - badly. They have contacted the [Root.GetAdjective] government and offered peace, in exchange for all their claimed territories. It is a hard pill to swallow, but the alternative is very likely for us to be crushed completely."
gre.254.a: "We must make peace while we can"
gre.254.b: "No - they will have to fight us to the last man"
gre.255.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Peace"
gre.255.d: "It seems the [From.GetAdjective] government wishes to fight us to the last man. They have turned down our offer of terms."
gre.255.a: "So be it!"
gre.256.t: "A New Capital?"
gre.256.d: "Konstantinoúpolis is once again under our control, and a question has now been risen: should the [Root.GetAdjective] capital be moved? For the sake of stability, some are saying it should not... but there are still others who say it is the greatest city in our nation, perhaps the greatest in our history. With the glory of [Root.GetNameDef] having been achieved, perhaps it should be reflected in our seat of government?"
gre.256.a: "Yes, this is the proper capital of our nation."
gre.256.b: "No, we remain in Athens as always."
gre.257.t: "The Return of [transfer_state.GetName]"
gre.257.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has transfered control of our former lands in [transfer_state.GetName]. [Root.GetNameDefCap] is now one step closer to being made whole."
gre.257.a: "At last!"
gre.258.t: "Partition of Macedonia"
gre.258.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has split the majority-Greek regions of Macedonia under their control."
gre.258.a: "Great."
gre.259.t: "The New Greek Expansionism"
gre.259.d: "While there are benefits to having the Greeks as allies, they have recently announced a renewal in their expansionism goals - the kind of expansionism which will put them at odds against the Turks and their other neighbours. It's an age-old story in the Balkans, and now we must consider whether we want the [Root.GetFactionName] to be a part of it."
gre.259.a: "We don't want to get drawn into this"
gre.259.b: "It's fine - they've proven their worth"
gre.260.t: "Greece Ejected from the [From.GetFactionName]"
gre.260.d: "It appears our expansionism intentions have alarmed our [From.GetAdjective] allies. Despite all we've given them in the past, they have asserted that they will not get drawn into our wars to reclaim lost territory. We are on our own."
gre.260.a: "So be it!"
gre.261.t: "The Extent of Greek Claims"
gre.261.d.faction: "[GRE.GetNameDefCap] is ready to reclaim our lost territory and rescue our lost brethren. The question at hand is this: do we push our claims eastward, but keep them within 'traditional' Greek lands - [184.GetName] and the islands of the Eastern Mediterranean, such as [183.GetName] - or do we resurrect the Megali Idea and claim everything eastward up to [773.GetName] and the western coast of Anatolia, despite the majority Turkish population in those areas. Megali is an elusive but dangerous dream... if we pursue it, it will be seen as an aggressive move on our part, and we may be kicked out of the [Root.GetFactionName] as a result."

Once inside the Holy Communion was performed with Senators and patricians offering their prostrations. The Patriarch read a set of lengthy prayers before presenting the emperor with the mantle and crown.

In order for Greece to be saved from itself a new state must be born, one that harkens back to the traditions of the Ancient Hellenics. A nation for Greeks to wholly commit themselves to, with the same determination and discipline that the Spartans had. A nation that follows in the footsteps of Pericles, who’s Athenean regime evolved into the ‘First Greek Civilization’. A nation that honours the legacy of our forebears who brought greatness and pride to all of Europe and the greater world, a people who are worthy enough to proclaim lineage to Alexander the Great. Greece will become the eternal flame of the Balkans, a beauty never to be extinguished. Through these trying times it is the Greek ecclesiastic hierarchy who will take on leadership of the Orthodox Church, whilst our neighbours collapse we shall strive forward.

With the Ottoman forces now fleeing we will move our government from Athens and establish Constantinople as the new capital of Greece, this is just the beginning for the planned resurrection of the Byzantine Empire!"
gre.302.a: "It has always belonged to us!"
gre.303.t: "Striking Our Mortal Enemies"
gre.303.d: "Since the dawn of Hellenic civilisation, our people have been under threat from the eastern hordes. Whether it be the gigantic Achaemenid Empire or rapidly expanding Ottomans, the struggle for independence has defined our history. Today marks the dawn of vengeance, well shall avenge our ancestors who defended the walls of Constaninople, who fought for Greek independence and who battled the Turks once more during the Weltkrieg. The valiant heroes of the past did not die in vain, their legacy will continue through our armies who already are marching towards the Ottoman front lines!"
gre.303.a: "Onwards to victory!"
gre.304.t: "Warrior Culture"
gre.304.d: "Greece’s history has been built upon warfare, the fractious nature of Ancient Greek society forged a people who lived life through battle. With the rise of ancient military powers such as the Spartans, came the development of new styles of warfare: the hoplite phalanx being one example. This innovation of military tactics and formations defined the Greek warriors. The Ancient Macedonian Army under King Philip was composed of supremely defensive formations that allowed for his armies to dominate the battleground. It is from this innovation that we will seek to develop a superior fighting force that can defend our borders from our enemies who surround us.\n\nOur military strategic experts have been researching extensively into historical Greek military tactics, and from this they have devised two plans. Both plans take inspiration from both Ancient Greece and Byzantium. The first idea is the 'Neo-Nicean Army'. We simply do not have the vast resources at our disposal like the Byzantine Empire of old. Like the Empire of Nicaea, we are cornered, but we will not fall like our ancestors! We will make the most of our situation, employing a smaller, yet highly disciplined force to outwit our enemies on the battlefield. The other plan is the ‘New Komnenian Army’, as the name suggests, the military would adopt tactics used during the Komnenian era, which includes the pronoia system. This system grants fiscal rights and lands to loyal individuals who serve the Empire with all of their being, ensuring a loyal and steady supply of men. The Komnenian army also employed numerous skilled mercenary companies to fill the gaps that a native army was insufficient at, and we shall do the same. The only drawback the latter plan has is grave, though; we lack a strong economic base after Black Monday, and such a great investment into the army may spell doom and bankruptcy for our state. Which plan shall we choose?"
gre.304.a: "...the New Komnenian Army"
gre.304.b: "...the Neo-Nicean Army"
gre.305.t: "The Founding of the New Byzantine Empire!"
gre.305.d: "Under the blessings of the Patriarch, the purple phoenix has risen from the ashes. The Byzantine flag has been raised over Constantinople for the first time since Emperor Constantine XI fell, defending his decimated empire from the Turkish invaders. The Weltkrieg left Greece devastated, however under our glorious leadership the Hellenic people are united and have expanded beyond their borders to reclaim what is rightfully theirs!"
gre.305.a: "For the Emperor!"
gre.308.t: "The Fall of Rome"
gre.308.d: "After a period of intensive fighting throughout the streets of Rome, the ancient city is now under Byzantine control once more. Just like the Gothic War, when Byzantine forces reclaimed the former capital of the Roman Empire from the barbarians, we have restored true Roman order to these lands. The Double-Headed Eagle banner has been placed above the Vatican and the Pope has been forced out and replaced with a true Patriarch of the Othordox Catholic Church. Although the city is still unstable and susceptible to an invasion from the forces in the north of Italy it has been agreed by the Byzantine Senate that Rome should be declared the ceremonial capital of the Empire. For logistical reasons all governing will still take place in Constantinople for the time being."
gre.308.a: "Veni, vidi, vici."
gre.309.t: "Third Hellenic Civilization"
gre.309.d: "The republican era of Greece has been a scourge on the youth, lack of central authority and enforced morality has produced weak children. Children who are not fit to inherit the Greek state, therefore we have established the National Youth Organisation (Ethnikí Orgánosis Neoléas). This will instill the same sense of loyalty and duty that Spartan youth possesed, the youth of the nation will swear an oath to defend Greece at all costs. The activities of the EON include athletic events, parades, marches and military training, this will cultivate their national values and cooperational spirit. The goal of the EON is to build a generation of youth who will establish the ‘Third Hellenic Civilisation’, one that maintains the aesthetics of Ancient Greece and Byzantine whilst prepared to face the modern world..."
gre.309.a: "One nation, one king, one leader, one youth!"
gre.310.t: "Caesaropapism"
gre.310.d: "From the 330 consecration of Constantiople through to the tenth century, the Emperors of Byzantine held great authority over the Church and religious affairs. This power was fit only for a divine monarch whose authority and rule was blessed by God, many centuries have passed since a leader of Greece could claim such holy blessings that would justify authority over the Church. That is until now, our Archigos has rebuilt Greece under the faith of Orhtodox Christianity. It is this dedication to faith that has allowed Greece to enter into a period of prosperity. Furthermore Ecumenical councils have been established to aid in the settlement of religious matters. The moral degradation and sins of republicanism, liberalism and syndicalism will never conquer the spirit of Greece!"
gre.310.a: "Deus Vult!"

gre.264.t: "Georgios Kondylis Dead!"
gre.264.d: "Regent-for-life and prominent general, Georgios Kondylis, nicknamed ‘Keravnos’ or ‘Thunderbolt’, has sadly passed away due to a heart attack. The fierce military commander had a long history serving in the military, serving in the Crete expedition, Macedonian Struggle and as captain during the Balkan Wars. Beloved by many as a national hero, his reputation throughout the Weltkrieg was enough to strike fear into the hearts of Greece’s enemies. During the choas of post-Weltkrieg Greece he took power and offered stability to his people.\n\nWith no apparent heir, Prime Minister Papandreou, in agreement with the republican parties that have a large legislative majority, proclaimed the Greek Republic, becoming interim president and appointing Panagiotis Kanellopoulos as Prime Minister. Depsite proclaiming a Republic, Papandreou has made it clear he intends to hold a long-promised referendum on the Status of the Greek Monarchy, at the earliest convenience."
gre.264.a: "The nation mourns..."

gre.313.t: "The Socialist Populist Coalition"
gre.313.d: "Troubling news comes from our informants who are affiliated with left leaning Greek political parties! It seems that the conniving Nikos Zachariadis has, with a menagerie of rhetoric, manipulation, and blackmail, united most of the Greek left into a new coalition: the Socialist Populist Coalition. A united left will surely spell trouble for us, as we can already hear their voices reach the people about our army committing heinous acts against our conquered foe in the name of Byzantium! In a surprising twist of events, Zachariadis has claimed that we have not fulfilled the true Byzantium, as it was an Empire of many peoples. He goes further into lunacy, calling Byzantium 'the first true socialist nation', citing the revolts of many populist leaders of the time, including Basil the Copper Hand, a revolutionary who lead a revolt of peasants a milennium ago. While we expected the people to disregard this lunacy, it appears quite the opposite: the left coalition is growing stronger and stronger each day."
gre.313.a: "This is concerning."

gre.314.t: "On the Status of Greek Primacy"
gre.314.d: "The talk around Greece is the decision of the Prime Ministership, with the key issue lying with non-Greek minorities. With our armies ever successful, we have come to control large swathes of land that once belonged to us. However, over the centuries, Greeks have become a minority in these lands, vastly outnumbered by Arabs and Turks who are less than friendly to our rule to say the least. While we could easily drown out these heretics after years of Greek settlement and through eroding minority freedoms, this would likely cause a wave of violent backlash. Alternatively, we can take a pluralist direction, and work with these minorities to build a multi-ethnic and egalitarian new Byzantium, for it is with practices like these that the original Byzantine Empire lasted so long. What should we do?"
gre.314.a: "These new lands shall be Greek and Greek alone!"

gre.315.t: "The Greek Exodus"
gre.315.d: "Finally putting our plan into action, Greeks have begun to leave the homeland in droves, moving in massive convoys to settle in Constantinople and Anatolia once more. Though this has created some tension, we have a handle on the situation now, and we are confident we can put down any trouble should it arise. These old lands of the fallen empire shall now be Greek once more as the might of our people and culture spreads out from Greece once again."
gre.315.a: "We shall be the King of Kings ruling over all other rulers once again!"

gre.316.t: "The Anatolian Riots"
gre.316.d: "In a reaction to our nationalist pro-Greek agenda, the Turks and other minorities of Anatolia have begun to violently riot against our policies. Greek settlers are under attack all across this new region, and blood has already been spilled. We must declare an official stance to these riots and fast, lest they spread further across the Empire."
gre.316.a: "They will come to their senses in time. Let the riots die out themselves."
gre.316.b: "They shall learn our peaceful ways by force!"

gre.317.t: "The Reds Strike!"
gre.317.d: "Disaster! Our police failed to quell the riots around Anatolia! In fact, by resorting to violence, the Socialist Populist Coalition has completely turned this problem on our heads. The riots have swollen to breaking out throughout the country, as Greek and Turk join hand in hand in protesting our unfair rule and treatment. Nikos Zachariadis himself has lead a march to Constantinople to depose our rule! With the people against us, and even the most staunch nationalists having no desire to spill Greek blood, it appears all we can do is watch as the Socialist Populist Coalition seizes power in Byzantium."
gre.317.a: "No! That's not how this is supposed to go!"
GRE_kondylis_dead: "The Thunderbolt Regent had died"

gre.318.t: "The Last Laugh"
gre.318.d: "Originally constructed in 537 A.D under the reign of Justinian I, the Hagia Sophia has been the center and seat of  Christendom since it's foundation. In it's millennia long history, the Church of Holy Wisdom has suffered much, everything from fires and floods to Latin occupation, there is little the grandest Cathedral on earth hasn't endured. The greatest and latest of these sufferings has of course been it's desecration and mocking by the vile Mohammedans, who have, since 1453, used the greatest testament to God's glory build by human hands as a mosque. Covering the glorious icons of Our Lord and Lady with blasphemous symbols, the Mohammedans have spent the last 600 years making a mockery of Christ in the very spot were his sacrifice was represented to the Faithful, at least they had, until now. With the City of the World's Desire once more under the control of it's rightful masters, Emperor [tag.getleader] has ordered that the Hagia Sophia be transformed from a place of vile blasphemy into a place of true sacrifice and worship to the One, True, Triune God. Ordering that the very walls be scrubbed until the great icons of old are once more shown to the world, the Emperor has also officially reinstated the Church as the seat of the Ecumenical Patriarch. While reconstruction and revitalization efforts shall take some time, before long the halls of the Hagia Sophia will sound with the glory of the Divine Liturgy, restored to it's proper place."
gre.318.a: "After so long a time, Christendom regains her rightful capital!"
