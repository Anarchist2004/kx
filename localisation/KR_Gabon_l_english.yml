### Focus tree ###
GAB_fall_of_the_iron_cross:0 "Fall of the Iron Cross"
GAB_fall_of_the_iron_cross_desc:0 "The Iron Cross that once stretched across the dark expanse of this massive continent has finally fallen - and with it the last shred of stability and peace left in Africa has gone along with it. We are a sea of Frenchmen and Africans lost amidst a sea of Krauts and chaos. We must tread carefully as we seek to establish our sovereignty here on the Equatorial Coast."

GAB_kick_out_the_congo:0 "Kick out the Kongo"
GAB_kick_out_the_congo_desc:0 "The Manikongo to the south has invaded our borders, serving as ominous and ravenous heralds to the utter apocalypse that has reached Africa with the collapse of the German goliath. We must repel these savage tribesmen at all costs, for if we wait too long, their friends in Portugal might send aid!"

GAB_open_recruitment:0 "Lower Our Recruitment Standards"
GAB_open_recruitment_desc:0 "If we are to drive back the Manikongo’s forces and preserve our newfound independence, we will need men to fill the ranks of our newly raised regiments. Historically, the defense force of our mighty colony has been selective with its troop intake, but the time for caution and strict standards is dead and gone. Now is the time for action as we fight for our survival!"

GAB_borrow_french_guns:0 "Requisition Guns from the French"
GAB_borrow_french_guns_desc:0 "With the fall of colonial rule, our access to the wider German economy has been cut off, and with it, we have also lost our easy access to new equipment. While raiding old caches and weapon-stores may be enough to outfit a few divisions, we will need a steady supply of firearms if we are to beat back the Kongo monarchists. We must make overtures to the Algerian Regime in order to sequester new weapons of war as we fight for our survival."

GAB_conscript_askari:0 "Conscript the Askari"
GAB_conscript_askari_desc:0 "The Askari that were once loyal to the Germans now find themselves with no benefactors nor allies in the wake of Mittelafrika’s demise. Though French colonial regimes rarely relied on these native mercenaries, now is not the time to be picky. We shall reach out to these aimless veterans and offer them a new deal - fight for the Gabonese army as our elite and specialized infantry force, or lose all benefits and rewards being an Askari once granted. Surely waving their pensions and right to vote in their faces will get them to jump to action!"

GAB_gabriels_cabal:0 "Gabriel's Cabal"
GAB_gabriels_cabal_desc:0 "Gabriel Léon M’ba rules as the first ‘president’ of an independent Gabon, though his regime already shows the tell tale signs of undemocratic practices and wider ambitions that lay outside the regular purview of a normal democracy’s limits on power. For M’ba, being president is not to better his fellow Gabonese, but to enrich himself and his associates as they run Gabon as their personal playground. Under this cabal, Gabon shall bend to the will of its first, and possibly last, president."

GAB_penal_labour:0 "Toil for the President"
GAB_penal_labour_desc:0 "President M’Ba has a long history of co-opting his followers and constituents to bend to his will, both mentally and physically. Implementing strategies and ideas he perfected during his time as ‘chef de canton’ of Libreville’s largest Fang burrough, M’ba shall finally have the workforce he desperately needs to build up Gabon’s fledgling economy. No one may deny the call to work from our President!"

GAB_reverse_apartheid:0 "Independence at Any Cost"
GAB_reverse_apartheid_desc:0 "President M’Ba, though a rabid Francophile, still seeks to establish Gabon as an independent and self-sufficient nation, free of any colonist aide or influence. To do this, Gabon shall be transformed into a beacon of autarky, and anyone that disagrees with these new edicts shall be dealt with accordingly. The assets of the remaining Huns will be seized, the press and civil liberties will be restricted, and any remaining colonialist holdouts resistant to our regime will be forced to work for our regime or face our wrath. Gabon needs no other!"

GAB_foreign_labour:0 "Accept Harsh Realities"
GAB_foreign_labour_desc:0 "President M’ba has seen the writing on the wall - Gabon is a fragile and fledgling nation on a continent of chaos, and will need help if it is to survive. Though he will still go to great lengths to curtail any and all chances at internal dissent, he shall do so with a lighter hand to save face with his new partners as he plays nice with the French government in order to secure the necessary funding and aid Gabon needs to survive. Gabon may not need others, but their help shall certainly be taken when we can get it so easily."

GAB_fang_supremacy:0 "Fang Supremacy"
GAB_fang_supremacy_desc:0 "Belonging to the wider Ekang subgroup of the Bantu people, the Fang are a some of the most numerous of the varied peoples of East-Central Africa, with their numbers spreading across Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Kamerun. Their dominance shall continue not only in number but through state policy as well, for President M’Ba, a Fang man himself, has begun to increasingly favor his native people in all matters of state policy. Ideas of Fang suprematism and Bantu extremism have begun to takehold through Gabon, and M’ba does not seem to show any signs of stopping it."

GAB_bwati_national_religion:0 "Embrace the Bwiti Faith"
GAB_bwati_national_religion_desc:0 "With the arrival of the French colonizers, Christianity quickly replaced Biere as the dominant religion of the various Gabonese people. With the return of native rule, interest in our native roots has exploded, with Biere also becoming incredibly popular again. However, more interesting has been the explosion in popularity of the syncretic Bwiti faith, a fusion of Christianity and Biere beliefs mixed with the ceremonial usage of psychedelics on specific holidays. With President M’ba, member of the Fang people who first practiced this new religion, even taking part in some of its beliefs and rituals, perhaps the time has come to fully embrace Bwiti as a national faith."

GAB_return_to_french_rule:0 "A French ‘Constitution’"
GAB_return_to_french_rule_desc:0 "With the birth of this newly independent Gabonese ‘republic,’ a new constitution shall be needed for the nation, and what better system to emulate than the French. We have only witnessed firsthand how ineffectual the German system is, and with President M’Ba’s clear francophile sympathies already becoming apparent, the French system is the clear way to go for our people. Besides, our esteemed President can always make alterations to the document as needed. It is only a piece of paper after all."

GAB_join_entente:0 "Overtures to Old Allies"
GAB_join_entente_desc:0 "With our new government established and the foundations for President M’ba’s rule beginning to fully cement, it is time we established full contact with the rightful French regime who has long been Exiled to Algiers. The stench of syndialism shall not disgrace M’ba’s pure Gabon state, and the Entente and our old overlords shall be the perfect deterrent. We open our arms to our old allies!"

GAB_president_for_life:0 "L'Hyperprésident du Gabon"
GAB_president_for_life_desc:0 "Gabriel Léon M’ba has ruled over Gabon with an iron fist, but has always maintained an air of legitimacy and democracy. However, this all ends now as M’ba seeks to elevate himself past his current position as mere president. M’ba has higher aspirations in mind, and no small hurdles like voting or oppositional parties will stand in his way. M’ba shall rise to become the first ‘Hyperprésident du Gabon’ - a dictator in all but name, giving him the power to do as he pleased fully and totally for life."

GAB_paranoia_of_man:0 "The Paranoia of Man"
GAB_paranoia_of_man_desc:0 "Hyperprésident M’ba has narrowly survived the military coup aimed at ousting him from power, and with their failure, the dreams of a democratic Gabon die with them. Now the nation will know just how far their Hyperprésident is willing to go, for the paranoia has begun to fester within the mind of their great leader. M’ba will not rest until Gabon is safe and secure, for nothing will stand in the way of his insatiable lust for total dominance."

GAB_purge_the_military:0 "Cull the Traitors"
GAB_purge_the_military_desc:0 "The instrument of the failed coup was our military - long dominated by German sympathizers and democratic rabble. The entire Gabonese military shall be cleansed from the bottom-up,  with no traitor left standing nor any weakling left to sully our good name. Our military shall be forged to be as resolute and as dedicated to our survival as the Hyperprésident himself!"

GAB_blame_the_huns:0 "An Easy Scapegoat"
GAB_blame_the_huns_desc:0 "It was the Huns! Every single poor decision our administration has made, every misstep we have taken, every problem that ails our state, and ever mallady that plagues our people has been caused by these vile and incompetant Germans. Their colonial monstrosity is what oppressed us for so long and its collapse is what has thrown our very way of life into absolute chaos. Blame it all on the Huns, and let the people take their frustrations on the true culprit behind their woes!"

GAB_who_the_hell_needs_democracy:0 "Who the Hell Needs Democracy?"
GAB_who_the_hell_needs_democracy_desc:0 "Our glorious Hyperprésident has evolved past the need for democracy. The voice of the people only clouds his near-divine judgement while their incessant need for attention and direction only serves as a distraction to M’ba’s ambitious vision. The last semblances of democracy shall be cast off from Gabon, for the only opinion and word that matters now is the word of M’ba."

GAB_greater_kleptocracy:0 "What About Greater Kleptocracy?"
GAB_greater_kleptocracy_desc:0 "It has been no secret that from the very beginning of his entrance to politics, Gabriel M’ba has thirsted for self-satisfaction and profit above all else. He has openly declared at many a state function and gathering that he merely entered the political arena to make himself rich while pleasing his esteemed Évolué family. Now as Hyperprésident of this new Gabonese state, nothing can stand in his way as he turns the nation into a true and pure kleptocracy - one that entirely benefits himself above all others. Gabon shall be M’ba’s private playground as he endeavors to become the richest man in all of Africa!"

GAB_sucsesful_coup:0 "The Folly of Man"
GAB_sucsesful_coup_desc:0 "With his French benefactors leaving him to the wolves, President M’ba’s authoritarian kleptocracy has collapsed under the pressure of the Gabonese Defense and Security Forces. Now, under the protection of our military, true democracy shall be brought to the Gabonese people - a right stolen from them by the villainous M’ba."

GAB_rebuild_democratic_institutions:0 "Rebuild Democratic Institutions"
GAB_rebuild_democratic_institutions_desc:0 "The deposed ‘Hyperprésident’ M’ba suffocated and quashed virtually every institution, system, or check within our government that could be even thinly labeled ‘democratic.’ Under his rule, the Bloc Démocratique Gabonais became the sole party of our dying republic as M’ba transformed Gabon into a single-party kleptocracy fueled entirely by the Hyperprésident’s greed and ambition. We must weave true democratic ideals and practices back into the fabric of our nation lest the country unravel entirely."

GAB_reverse_the_madmans_policies:0 "Reverse the Madman's Policies"
GAB_reverse_the_madmans_policies_desc:0 "M’ba the madman has been deposed, but many of his vile policies remain. Ideas of Fang supremacism must be contained and suppressed while the other religions must be brought back as nationally accepted faiths to further foster unity in our fractured people. Press freedoms will return, and all further criticisms can be voiced against the legislation of the M’ba regime. We shall tear down his twisted legacy page by page until Gabon is finally free!"

GAB_aubuames_conservatives:0 "Aubame's UDSG"
GAB_aubuames_conservatives_desc:0 "In the first fair elections free from the tampering of the fallen Hyperprésident, Jean-Hilaire Aubame and his Union Démocratique et Sociale Gabonaise have taken hold of the nation. Once M’ba’s largest rival and critic before the creation of his one party state under the BDG, Aubame now leads a coalition of the remaining true conservatives left untainted by M’ba working with a slew of socially liberal, anti-socialist reformers. Taking inspiration from Louis Marin and the Fédération Républicaine and fusing it with our president’s own socially liberal, economically conservative ideas and faith, Aubame and the UDSG shall build Gabon up as a bastion of true Social-Christian republicanism."

GAB_crush_colonial_corruption:0 "Crush Colonial Corruption"
GAB_crush_colonial_corruption_desc:0 "With the German colonial apparatus dead, the M’ba regime overthrown, and the French colonialists largely outnumbered, we can finally take on the herculean task of quashing corruption within our republic once and for all. For too long have politicians, civil servants, military officials, and imperialists let their greed and ambitions run rampant within our borders. The Gabonese Republic will be cleansed of this sin."

GAB_tatical_investment:0 "Gabonese Civic Nationalism"
GAB_tatical_investment_desc:0 "In order to create a truly strong and united democratic atmosphere, we must actively work to include as many within our borders as possible. Gabon is land of various and distinct Bantu tribes, from the Estuaire and the Ogooué groups to the Nyanga and Woleu Ntem. These myriad ethnic bands, along with our minority Pygmy population, must all band together under ideas we can all share and have pride in. Our rights, our liberties, our shared cultures and identity as the Gabonese people shall unite us like no mere racially-motivated nationalism could. We are Gabonese, one and all!"

GAB_church_voulenteership:0 "Utilize the Church"
GAB_church_voulenteership_desc:0 "With the French came Catholicism, and despite M’ba’s attempts to snuff out pure Christian beliefs with his syncretic ideas, Catholicism still dominates the people of Gabon. We too are true sons and daughters of God, and as such, the Catholic Church has long been allowed to operate within our borders. Henceforth, we shall actively support the Church so that we may use it as a tool to strengthen this democratic republic we are creating."

GAB_church_tax_exemptions:0 "Social Catholicism"
GAB_church_tax_exemptions_desc:0 "The three pillars of a just and righteous society are human dignity, solidarity, and subsidiarity. These guiding principles shall form the cornerstone of our pious new democracy, as we endeavor to both respect the rights and abilities of our people. The Lord is our Saviour, and we are His children - may His doctrine guide us as we strive to create a fair and just society that knows limits and good Christian morals."

GAB_in_god_we_trust:0 "Dieu et la Liberté"
GAB_in_god_we_trust_desc:0 "Under President Aubame, Gabon has been transformed into a stable and moral democratic haven here on the Dark Continent. Utilizing ideas from the French colonizers’ more enlightened and ethical thinkers and fusing them with our own unique Gabonese spirit, we have created a pious, steadfast, and resilient republic that no longer bears the dark mark of the M’ba regime or the Kaiser’s greed. Gabon is free and safe at last, under God."

GAB_gondouts_liberals:0 "Gondjout’s PDG"
GAB_gondouts_liberals_desc:0 "In the first fair elections free from the tampering of the fallen Hyperprésident, Paul Marie Indjendjet Gondjout and his Parti Démocratique Gabonais have taken back their seats as the rightful rules of the nation as they strip their party of any and all traces of the Hyperprésident’s regime. Once the leader of the centre-right BDG before M’ba seized power and stole party leadership from him, Gondjout now leads a coalition of liberal economists, Secular conservatives, and Pro-Westernization groups left untainted by M’ba. Taking inspiration from the Alliance Démocratique and from theorists such as Paul Reynaud and Pierre Étienne-Flandin and fusing it with his own beliefs, our new President and the PDG shall build Gabon up as a true embodiment of pluralistic and profitable democracy."

GAB_western_investment:0 "French-Inspired Liberalism"
GAB_western_investment_desc:0 "Our republic shares the same roots and lineage of the heroes of the French Revolution, the great Enlightenment thinkers, and the titans of French Liberalism from Montesquieu and Constant to de Staël and Reynaud. Ideas such as the separation of powers, inherent civil rights and liberties, true democratic republicanism, capitalist enterprise, and so much more form the foundation of our Republic’s very existence. This legacy shall become the foundation of our new government as we work to bring true liberty to the Gabonese people."

GAB_westernization_first:0 "Westernization First"
GAB_westernization_first_desc:0 "Though it may be hard to accept for many within our nation, we need the West and their modern ideas if we are to survive in the world order they have created. Westernization and modernization must be top priorities of the state, for if we fall behind any farther, our opportunistic neighbors or foreign imperialists will come knocking once more."

GAB_satisfy_basic_needs:0 "Meeting the Needs of the People"
GAB_satisfy_basic_needs_desc:0 "It is the basic goal of a government to provide the basic needs of its people, but the M’ba regime and the colonialist establishments of the past both failed to do even this most basic and fundamental task - this must change. Our citizens, as rightful members of this Gabonese Republic, have certain inalienable rights that the state must protect and deliver upon. It is time we had a government that truly cared for and respected its people and we can provide for them without giving falling to radicalism and giving into deceit like the silver-tongued leftists that seek to undermine our rule."

GAB_tip_from_kenyesianism:0 "A Tip from Keynesianism"
GAB_tip_from_kenyesianism_desc:0 "Despite being a member of the ever-scheming Anglos, John Maynard Keynes has been making a splash in the wider international scene as a brilliant and near-clairvoyant economic theorist. His ideas, an evolution of the laissez-faire mindset that had taken hold of Britain before the revolution and the wider world since, is based on free market principles, social welfare systems, and anti-austerity stances, among a slew of other novel ideas. We should take a note from Keynes as we develop our new modern economy."

GAB_free_market:0 "Union, Travail, Justice"
GAB_free_market_desc:0 "Under President Gondjout, Gabon has been transformed from an underdeveloped, humanitarian nightmare into steadily growing economic paradise where profit and liberty are paramount virtues. This secular, shining republic has fully washed clean the decay and toxic residue left over from the M’ba regime and the Krauts, and the people of Gabon rejoice for it. Liberty rings across our union, for working together towards prosperity and profit has brought true justice and freedom to the Gabonese people."

GAB_entente_question:0 "Old ‘Friends’ or New Horizons?"
GAB_entente_question_desc:0 "Well before the Iron Cross of the Kaiserreich rose over Africa, the French ruled these lands we call home, and all the while we lived under their rule, their culture melded with ours and became part of who we are. When the Hun fell, Hyperprésident M’ba one more reached out to the French to make overtures, and in doing so, secured their aid. Now, M’ba is gone and we rule Gabon, so we must make a choice: stay aligned with our former overlords and the regime that backed a destructive madman, or find our own way?"

GAB_pierres_socialists:0 "Goura’s GUDS"
GAB_pierres_socialists_desc:0 "In the first fair elections free from the tampering of the fallen Hyperprésident, Pierre Goura and his Groupe de l'Union Démocratique et Socialiste have won a surprise victory over the more moderate candidates, and now seeks to put Gabon on the road to Socialism. Heavily influenced by Marceau Pivert and his radical Parti Socialiste Ouvrier et Paysan, Goura shall bring the red beacon of Syndicalism and Socialism here to Gabon, but heavily altered to fit the realities of our underdeveloped nation and with a unwavering dedication to true democracy. The Gabon proletariat shall finally be free under President Goura as he welcomes the Red Tide to our shores."

GAB_break_the_colonial_shackles:0 "Break the Shackles of Colonialism"
GAB_break_the_colonial_shackles_desc:0 "With the victory of President Goura and the GUDS, one of the state’s most pressing concerns has been to crush the last vestiges of colonialism influence within the nation, namely from the previous German and imperialist French regimes. Many of our institutions and systems still bear the marks and scars of colonialist greed and imperial inequalities. The last of these traces must be eradicated and replaced with more equitable and fair institutions that are capable of accurately providing for our people with the allure of corruption and personal gain getting in the way. The Gabonese people are free, it is time we started living like it."

GAB_true_agrarianism:0 "Afro-Syndicalist Agrarianism"
GAB_true_agrarianism_desc:0 "Though we are inspired by the successes of the Commune in Paris and their progress towards benefiting mankind, many of their policies would not work in a nation in our current state. Their emphasis on industrialization and urbanization shall be dialed back and replaced with emphasis on mechanized agriculture as we bend their ideas and fuse them with our own to create a new, uniquely African solution to our situation. Agrarianism shall be embraced fully with a focus on animal husbandry more so over large scale crop-farming as we slowly build up small amounts of modern industry, particularly in manganese mining and timber harvesting, in the background. This will allow us to craft a new, worker-orientated economy where the realities of our situation and the needs of the people are both taken into account."

GAB_voluntary_collectives:0 "Voluntary Collectives"
GAB_voluntary_collectives_desc:0 "Democracy is sacred, and our people have their inherent rights that we can not infringe upon. However, our regime still thinks that collectivization of at least some sectors, particular within our agricultural departments, would do wonders to both our economy and our population’s sense of freedom and agency. To this end, a completely voluntary system of collectivization shall begin, with those that participate receiving generous benefits from the state to incentivize more volunteers. Gabon’s agricultural sector, at least in part, will no longer be dominated by wage-slavers and workplace bureaucracy."

GAB_disband_askari:0 "A Red Militia"
GAB_disband_askari_desc:0 "Despite whatever reforms we shall undertake to transform the Gabonese armed forces into a formidable and reliable fighting force, a more localized force could prove to be extremely useful in the event of another military or foreign-backed coup like we all witnessed during the M’ba regime. A Red militia should be formed, taking volunteers from collectives and cooperatives throughout the nation, to serve as the last line of defense between Gabon and utter chaos if hard times should ever reach us again. These dedicated, loyal, and fervent supporters of our regime shall serve Gabon proudly!"

GAB_african_comrades:0 "Socialist Democracy and Comradery"
GAB_african_comrades_desc:0 "We have achieved the mandate of our rule democratically, and we will respect that mandate no matter our goals or ambitions. Democracy must be maintained at all costs, even if the people’s mandate changes hands and we are voted out, no matter how righteous and true our egalitarian cause may be. To ensure that we are reelected for terms to come to continue on our Socialist endeavor, we must earn the people’s trust and adoration while also building a combined sense of unity both within our own nation and with our African neighbors - regardless of their positions. Only together can Gabon and all of Africa be free."

GAB_red_africanism:0 "Red Africanism"
GAB_red_africanism_desc:0 "The Continent of Africa is vast, and much of our fellow Africans have yet to embrace or even think about the prospects of Socialism. We must be the heralds of this great awakening, for Socialism is the saviour they need but do not know it. We shall ride into this Red Dawn with the rest of our brothers and sisters in tow, for the Age of Imperialism is over, and the Age of Red Africa has only just begun..."

GAB_contact_the_real_france:0 "L'Internationale Sera le Genre Africain"
GAB_contact_the_real_france_desc:0 "Our Socialist foundation has been established under the wise and fair rule of President Goura, and now it is time to showcase our progress to the wider world. The Internationale, led by the rightful French government, is half a world away, and yet, they are our best hope at salvation. We shall reach out to their government, not as a former colony but as equals, and discuss matters of reconciliation and cooperation. Workers of the world unite!"

GAB_intergrate_askari:0 "The Question of the Askari"
GAB_intergrate_askari_desc:0 "As a former French colony, the concept of using Askari was foreign to us until the arrival of the Germans and the rise of Mittelafrika. With their rise, these favored Black soldiers of Mittelafrika, who were near slaves to their White masters who dangled basic decency in their faces as rewards, came to influence our military for both good and for ill. Under General Hans Schomburgk, they have continued to be a source of influence and annoyance despite their tiny size. Now, with our political situation stabilized, we must finally decide on what to do with these German-inspired soldiers: disband them or fully integrate them into our current armed forces’ structure?. "

GAB_officer_corps:0 "Establish a Proper Officer Corps"
GAB_officer_corps_desc:0 "With the Askari Question out of the way, we must now work to establish a true officer corp, both independent from politics and drilled in the finest of strategy and tactics. From the unruly rabble of our tribal forces to the pompous remnants of the French and German garrisons, all of our forces shall fall in line behind the new class of Gabonese officers."

GAB_first_squadron:0 "The First Squadron"
GAB_first_squadron_desc:0 "We must take flight! If we are to come out victoriously against any future foe, we will need airpower to do it. The last conflicts we fought have been internal squabbles or conflict with tribal kingdoms and ragtag, undersupplied, and isolated Germans. We will not be so lucky again, and so in the next war we won’t have to just rely on foot soldiers and guns, for now our soldiers will have their own eyes in the skies over Africa. The First Gabonese Squadron shall be the first of many!"

GAB_liberville_international:0 "Construct Libreville International"
GAB_liberville_international_desc:0 "In order to house and supply the airfleet we have so desperately strived for, we are going to need to build a modern airport unlike the people of Gabon have ever seen. Near the capital, just outside Libreville, we shall construct a large and (relatively) state of the art aerodrome, while also simultaneously launching a program to upgrade and renovate the few standing airstrips we have left from the colonial regime. We need the infrastructure on the ground before we can reliably take to the air."

GAB_experiment_with_french_designs:0 "Experiment with French Designs"
GAB_experiment_with_french_designs_desc:0 "The French, our original masters, have long innovated and experimented with aeronautical technologies. With our long-established ties, acquiring some of their more dated designs on the cheap could aid our research and development efforts tremendously. We shall purchase some of these models so that our engineers and scientists can begin a dedicated aeronautical research department of our own."

GAB_import_french_designs:0 "Import French Weapons..."
GAB_import_french_designs_desc:0 "The French have long been famous for making some innovative and bold design choices when it comes to weapons design, but overall, they make some fine weapons of war. Even if their equipment isn’t what it's all cracked up to be, their worst firearms are still miles better than anything we can reliably make for ourselves here outside of a select few gunsmiths in the capital. Using our established ties and trade links, we must purchase as many functional French firearms and artillery pieces as possible, no matter their age."

GAB_to_make_them_ourselves:0 "...To Make Them Ourselves"
GAB_to_make_them_ourselves_desc:0 "We have recently come into a large store of aged French weapons of war, ranging from pieces made in the years following the Weltkrieg to practical antiques. Whatever our troops can’t use in combat can be turned into scrap for future production or taken apart by our engineers to further our understanding of large-scale domestic weapon-smithing. We will make sure every rifle, handgun, and cannon is used in some way, for Gabon needs all the arms it can muster if we are to survive this continent of chaos."

GAB_bush_warfare:0 "Bush Warfare"
GAB_bush_warfare_desc:0 "Africa is a harsh continent, with varied climates and terrains that stretch across its expansive mass. In Gabon and the surrounding areas, savannahs dominate the landscape with dense pockets of monsoon forest that border the North and South. These wild lands are known to our people, and thus our soldiers, just as well as they know how to breathe or run. We shall use this knowledge to form the basis of our new military doctrine. We shall become masters of the Bush itself."

GAB_guerilla_art:0 "Perfect the Art of Guerilla Warfare"
GAB_guerilla_art_desc:0 "With their deep knowledge of the local terrain and with the new tactics we have developed instilled deeply in their hearts and minds, the Gabonese Defense and Security Forces have evolved into a fierce and ravenous fighting force. Each day, our militias raise from their volunteer’s barracks and drill the skills needed to defend our lands from any invader. With each drop of blood and sweat spilled, these Gabonese guerillas get one step closer to being the most feared fighting force in all of Central Africa!"

GAB_trainers_from_abroad:0 "The French Attachė"
GAB_trainers_from_abroad_desc:0 "The French have always aided in our development, and now is the time to ask them for their aid in our attempts at military development as well. We need to be able to defend ourselves in the face of the various threats that face us on this dangerous continent, and without their help, we would sooner be devoured by the predators that stalk us in the dark. Send a delegation the French; Gabon calls for aid!"

GAB_village_militias:0 "Militarize Rural Villages"
GAB_village_militias_desc:0 "The various villages, tribal kingdoms, and other small settlements that lie outside the major cities and across the countryside are a valuable and untapped asset we could utilize for our military’s gain. By offering incentives to volunteers from these population centers to join organized levees and militias, we could train the regular citizens of Gabon to be able to rise up at a moments notice. By spreading this system across the entire nation, Gabon could have an army of thousands ready to protect their nation at a moment’s notice. Every inch of Gabon shall become the frontline as every volunteer rises, rifle in hand, to defend their home."

GAB_jungle_firebombing:0 "Napalm’s Aroma"
GAB_jungle_firebombing_desc:0 "You smell that? That’s napalm, and nothing else smells like it in the world. Requisitioned from our French friends to the North, we have been able to quietly purchase and import tons of this vitriolic compound for use against any foe foolish or daring enough to step foot past our borders without our approval. They can not run, and they can not hide, for we shall burn the jungles they scurry away too like the vermin they are as we turn the very sky red with our ordinance."

GAB_napalm:0 "Turn Our Foes to Ash"
GAB_napalm_desc:0 "Though we know our land well, the forces we will be fighting will also be used to the rough and rugged terrain of our region unless some foolish Europeans try to land on our shores like all those centuries ago. To combat this, we can simply remove the advantage the terrain may give them. With enough cannons and firebombs, even the deepest thicket can be cleared, along with any enemy troops hiding among the trees. We will turn the land to cinders and our foes to ash if we have to in order to protect our sovereignty. The trees will regrow, our enemies will not."

GAB_howitzers_for_every_regiment:0 "Tear the Skies Down Upon Them"
GAB_howitzers_for_every_regiment_desc:0 "With our newly defined doctrine and quietly acquired weapons of devastating destruction, we have the weapons of war within our hands necessary to defend Gabon at all costs. If any foe dares to try and sully our sense of sovereignty or tries to stifle our ambition, we shall unleash hell upon them. Shell by shell and bomb by bomb, we will tear apart the sky and send the very heavens crashing down upon the heads of our enemies, for nothing and no one will stop the Gabonese war machine."

GAB_stall_the_post_colonial_shock:0 "Stall the Post Colonial Shock"
GAB_stall_the_post_colonial_shock_desc:0 "Drastic measures and quick action are what's needed to jumpstart our fledgling economy. We must delay the inevitable tremors from the collapse of colonial rule that will ravage this upstart economic system so that our financial future does not die before it can even begin."

GAB_fund_water_and_power_grids:0 "Nationalized Water and Power"
GAB_fund_water_and_power_grids_desc:0 "To quickly establish the needed basic infrastructure needed to build modern settlements and cities, we will need a system that can quickly and easily allocate funds and dictate demands without waiting for private business to build up or mess up. For now, Water and Power grids within Gabon will be run by the state until a time where some privatization can occur without causing destabilization."

GAB_invest_in_timber_industries:0 "Invest in the Timber Industry"
GAB_invest_in_timber_industries_desc:0 "One of our largest exports is lumber and timber, especially from the local hardwoods that grow in our native monsoon forests. We should capitalize on this readily-available source of easy income by heavily investing in our local woodcutting industry so that it can grow to become a truly profitable aspect of our economy."

GAB_textile_mills:0 "Gabonese Textiles"
GAB_textile_mills_desc:0 "Textile milling was some of the first industries to reach our shores, with much of our earliest laborers and now female industrial workers finding themselves working in looms across the nation. Bringing with them the skills and eye for design that they learned in their native cultures, particularly among the famously talented weavers of Libreville, textiles shall grow to become a major export of our economy while also providing ample uses for our own people."

GAB_offshore_oil:0 "Capitalise on Offshore Oil"
GAB_offshore_oil_desc:0 "Due to Germany’s desperation for more oil reserves, they have long spent time and money surveying their colonial holdings for oil. Before the collapse, a German survey team discovered hints that oil deposits may lie just off the Western coast of our nation. If we could seize this opportunity to have our very own oil industry, Gabon could see wealth beyond its wildest dreams as the world’s demand for Black Gold only continues to rise. Sure, it will be expensive and dangerous to tap our own oil while so inexperienced and underprepared, but our economy needs a jumpstart now!"

GAB_pump_the_oil_boom:0 "Further Fuel the Oil Boom"
GAB_pump_the_oil_boom_desc:0 "With the oil fields off our coast now tapped, we must entice the world powers to join in on the Gabonese oil craze. Though it has its uses, we have tapped far more oil than we can currently consume, and to make any sort of net gain after all the funds we dumped into getting the operation started, we will have to sell this prized liquid on the international market. Though the big leagues may be brutal and unforgiving, it is where we are also likely to make the quickest and heftiest profit."

GAB_early_rural_mechinazation:0 "The Beginnings of Rural Mechanization"
GAB_early_rural_mechinazation_desc:0 "Much of our population still lives within a rural environment, far from the hustle and bustle of Libreville or Port Gentil. We should begin to implement mechanization efforts in these rural communities to increase their working efficiency while also improving their standard of living as our young nation strives towards modernity."

GAB_the_trans_gabon_railway:0 "L’Transgabonais"
GAB_the_trans_gabon_railway_desc:0 "A rail system for Gabon was first planned as far back as 1885, but until now, virtually no rail or track existed within Gabon. To rectify this, our administration has begun to gather the necessary funds and contracts to create the Trans-Gabon Railway, or L’Transgabonais, to eventually connect the major cities of Libreville and Franceville on opposing ends of the nation. With stops along the way being constructed first in a few other stand-out locations like Abanga and Booué, we shall link our people together with iron and steel."

GAB_extend_to_makokou:0 "Extend the Line to Makokou"
GAB_extend_to_makokou_desc:0 "With the initial stages of L’Transgabonais being a relative success, we have decided to lay new track down towards the Northern city of Makokou. Prized for its proximity to our only major iron deposits, this new line shall ferry both ore and people to and from one of the most important cities in the nation."

GAB_extend_to_moanda:0 "Extend the Line to Moanda"
GAB_extend_to_moanda_desc:0 "With the initial stages of L’Transgabonais being a relative success, we have decided to lay new track down towards the Southern city of Moanda. The city has long prospered and held importance due to its proximity to the largest manganese deposits in Gabon - one of our main exports. This new line shall ferry both ore and people to and from one of the most important cities in the nation."

GAB_rural_infrastructure:0 "Rural Infrastructure"
GAB_rural_infrastructure_desc:0 "To better connect our people, we must build new infrastructure across Gabon, taming its wilderness as we go. The Abanga swamp will be partially drained to allow for better rail travel while also opening up areas for development. Meanwhile, new roads shall be constructed wide with new bridges built to cross the mighty Ogooué, fifth largest river in all of Africa. We shall tame the wilds of Gabon and connect our citizens, for even our most isolated people deserve access to the benefits of the state."

GAB_first_steps_to_industrialization:0 "First Steps to Industrialization"
GAB_first_steps_to_industrialization_desc:0 "Aside from our small but growing simple industries like mining, textiles, and timber harvesting, among others, Gabon largely lacks any meaningful levels of mass industrialization, and this becoming a reality anytime soon is pure fantasy. However, we can take the first steps towards this larger goal of an industrialized Gabon by funding the creation of a few local factories to begin producing goods vital to the state and our trade networks. We shall take these first few steps as quickly as possible, for we are desperate to avoid the growing pains of a newly independent economy, but the future is brighter for our economy than it ever has been."

GAB_establish_financial_beuracracy:0 "Establish a Financial Bureaucracy"
GAB_establish_financial_beuracracy_desc:0 "We currently have no real widespread and unified financial system. What little we had that remained from the colonial regimes was obliterated in the chaos of the Mittelafrikan Collapse. The Gabonese financial bureaucracy will be built from the ground up as rapidly as possible in order to get the nation on the path to prosperity as quickly as possible, or at least keep us away from an economic meltdown."

GAB_gabonese_franc:0 "The Gabonese Franc"
GAB_gabonese_franc_desc:0 "Pegged to the French Franc and utilized in a monetary system of French design, the Gabonese Franc shall become the national currency of our state. No longer shall various local currencies, barter economics, nor the Mark keep our economy locked in an archaic past or latched to a failed economy."

GAB_international_regognition:0 "Seek International Recognition"
GAB_international_regognition_desc:0 "We must seek international recognition for our fledgling republic if we are ever to establish ourselves as a legitimate player on the world stage. Without the recognition of the major powers, our economy will languish as the wider global economy passes us by."

GAB_shake_hands_with_the_french:0 "Shake Hands with the French"
GAB_shake_hands_with_the_french_desc:0 "The French have been tied to our people and our nation for decades, and with Germany no longer dictating how our people should be ruled, we should reach out to the French to discuss trade deals and mutually beneficial relations."

GAB_anglo_deals:0 "Deals with the Anglos"
GAB_anglo_deals_desc:0 "We have decided to reach out to the Anglos, long a dominant player in Africa before the Revolution. Though they do not control most of the world anymore, they are still a prosperous and economically shrewd people. We must establish official trade ties with them at once."

GAB_atlantic_trade:0 "Trade Across the Atlantic"
GAB_atlantic_trade_desc:0 "With our cooperation established, we shall begin to ship goods back and forth with the Anglos over the high and stormy seas of the Atlantic. With their business fueling our growing economy, we are sure not to fail."

GAB_deals_with_the_hun:0 "Deals with the Hun"
GAB_deals_with_the_hun_desc:0 "Though their vile colonial monstrosity oppressed our people since the Weltkrieg, the German have proven to be adept at business when they are so enticed. Mittelafrika was doomed to fail, but our nation is not. They are the world hegemon for a reason, and cooperation with them would surely only raise the prosperity of our people, right?"

GAB_pragmatic_trade:0 "Pragmatic Trade"
GAB_pragmatic_trade_desc:0 "We have accepted harsh truths before, and nothing is more true right now than Germany is richer than we are. We have swallowed our pride and resentment and are now moving to establish trade ties with our former overlords and oppressors. This pragmatic move has earned the ire from many within our regime, but President [GAB.getleader] knows this is the way towards true prosperity."

GAB_slow_and_steady_wins_the_race:0 "Slow and Steady Wins the Race"
GAB_slow_and_steady_wins_the_race_desc:0 "Methodical thinking and a slow and steady pace must be the approach we go with as we build our new post-colonial economy from the ground up. Rushing too quickly into this process could leave us sorely lacking in the future compared to if we had just been more patient."

GAB_no_room_for_corruption:0 "No Room for Corruption"
GAB_no_room_for_corruption_desc:0 "Corruption is a putrid and corrosive force that has infected our state since before its inception, with the foul stench of self-serving interests wafting off the colonial regimes that preceded our regime. We shall purify Gabon of this infection, picking through every layer of society with a fine-toothed comb, for there is no room for corruption in a prosperous and profitable state."

GAB_stable_beuracracy:0 "A Stable Bureaucracy"
GAB_stable_beuracracy_desc:0 "We must take our time and build a competent and stable bureaucracy that will be able to carry on the needs of the state and its people as our newly independent nation is established. We can not rush into this, for this institution will form the bedrock of our government for the foreseeable future."

GAB_ratified_tax_rate:0 "Graduated Tax Rate"
GAB_ratified_tax_rate_desc:0 "We shall issue a scaled, tiered tax plan that is guaranteed to be as fair as possible to all of our citizens while still providing the necessary funds for the state to utilize as a supplement to our trade income. All Gabonese shall pay their fair share to build a better society together."

GAB_the_gabonese_franc:0 "The Gabonese Franc"
GAB_the_gabonese_franc_desc:0 "Pegged to the French Franc and utilized in a monetary system of French design, the Gabonese Franc shall become the national currency of our state. No longer shall various local currencies, barter economics, nor the Mark keep our economy locked in an archaic past or latched to a failed economy."

GAB_start_the_teritary_sector:0 "Start the Tertiary Sector"
GAB_start_the_teritary_sector_desc:0 "The tertiary, or service, sector of an economy is the final stage three-sector theory, encompassing the intangible goods that established economies can provide that simple manufacturing or extraction sectors can not. The creation of a service industry is the mark of a modern economy, so we shall begin to create a domestic service sector to provide the accoutrements of a modernized state."

GAB_refine_administration:0 "Refine the Administration"
GAB_refine_administration_desc:0 "Though our initial steps at building up our economy have gone well, they could always be better. We must comb over every inch of our administration and economic infrastructure and cull the wheat from the chaff. All the excess and unneeded fat and bloat will be trimmed away as we streamline and purify the regime. In its place, as needed, new adjustments and additions will be made, and like a fine-tuned engine, we will tweak our systems until they are perfect."

GAB_water_and_power_grids:0 "Privatize Water and Power Grids"
GAB_water_and_power_grids_desc:0 "Though the state can still control key industries, selling off much of the burden to private companies will allow our own enterprising citizens a chance to earn their own living while providing necessary services to our people.The competition this will spark between competing firms will do more for our economy than letting them languish under state control would do."

GAB_new_enterprise:0 "Encourage New Enterprise"
GAB_new_enterprise_desc:0 "We must foster a love for profit and the entrepreneurial spirit within our people to rouse them to participate in a unified and open economy like never before seen in our lands. Our people must be made to realize that they are free to operate business and make their livings as they wish, and we shall incentivize the more adventurous souls who wish to risk it all and start their own businesses and practices. The allure of free enterprise shall drive Gabon to greatness!"

GAB_connect_cities:0 "Connect Our Cities"
GAB_connect_cities_desc:0 "Our cities lie in distant corners and nooks of our nations, separated by vast distances of rough terrain. Using foreing know-how and funding, we shall construct a series of new railways and roadways to connect the fragmented Gabon communities and cities that dot the savannahs and monsoon forests we call home. Gabon must be united!"

GAB_agricultural_autarky:0 "Agricultural Autarky"
GAB_agricultural_autarky_desc:0 "Autarky is a contentious topic in our republic, with advocates and opponents to it on both sides of the aisle. However, agricultural autarky is one of the few areas many of our ministers can agree on, with most seeing agricultural self-sufficiency and independence as a necessity for our nation. If we can’t feed our own people, we should not be trying to sell food to others!"

GAB_reap_what_we_sow:0 "Reap What We Sow"
GAB_reap_what_we_sow_desc:0 "Long has our state endeavored to slowly but surely build the Gabonese economy, and after a grueling and tense journey, it is time to cash in on our patience. Our economic policies, though at times painfully slow to show results, have finally begun to benefit the wider Gabonese nation. Prosperity has finally come knocking for our people, and we, as a strong and stable economic power on this otherwise chaotic continent, are finally able to answer the door."

GAB_invest_in_fledeling_buisness:0 "Invest in Fledgling Business"
GAB_invest_in_fledeling_buisness_desc:0 "Small businesses owned and operated by our own citizens shall form the backbone of our fledgling economy. Incentivizing our own populace to pick themselves up by their own bootstraps as they build their own fortunes and livelihoods shall be difficult at first, but once established, having our own domestic industry and commercial sector will be a great boon to our nation’s young financial system."

GAB_invite_foreign_companies:0 "Invite Foreign Companies"
GAB_invite_foreign_companies_desc:0 "Foreign investment will be key to building up our economy quickly while also establishing the long-term ties and partnerships needed to continue to fuel our economy’s growth for years to come. We must reach out to the wider Global market and entice foregin companies to come and set up shop in Gabon, for without their aid, our economy would likely stagnate and stall."

GAB_state_bonds:0 "State Bonds"
GAB_state_bonds_desc:0 "By issuing a series of state bonds, we can try and get our populace to see the benefit and need for long-term development and financing plans. These bonds shall help adjust inflation rates, create reliable avenues of starting income to continue our economic development, and overall build up legitimacy in the eyes of the people as we work to build a functional and modern economy based on the West’s teachings."

GAB_outsorce_labour:0 "Outsource Labour"
GAB_outsorce_labour_desc:0 "Gabon has a labour crisis - an odd problem to have with a population of nearly a million souls - but it is the reality we find ourselves in. Educated and skilled workers are nearly non-existent within our borders. To jumpstart our own economy, we shall outsource our skilled labour needs to foreign contractors and technicians, largely from France, to come and help establish our labour base. These hired foreigners will handle the workload as they teach our populace the skills they will need to do these jobs on their own."

GAB_rescoursce_expiditons:0 "Recourse Expeditions"
GAB_rescoursce_expiditons_desc:0 "Africa is a resource rich treasure trove, filled with variable resources and useful materials, and Gabon is no different. Iron, manganese, timber, and even small amounts of uranium and oil have been found within our borders. We must tap into these potential markets, turning the riches of the Earth into profits in our pockets."

GAB_encourage_western_imports:0 "Encourage Western Imports"
GAB_encourage_western_imports_desc:0 "The West may be responsible for much of what ails our people, but they are also responsible for the small taste of modernity we have experienced. Across the sea in their far-off lands, their factories churn out endless goods and products aimed at making life easier or more enjoyable for their citizens while further advancing their economy’s towards greater heights of wealth and prosperity. We should tap into this market and import as many foreign goods as possible. From mechanized tractors to radios, Gabon will have a taste of the finer life!"

GAB_tourism:0 "Lay the Grounds for Tourism"
GAB_tourism_desc:0 "Our nation is a beautiful and varied land, with thick monsoon forests that cover the Northern and Southern fringes and sprawling savannahs that stretch across our interior. As an oasis of general stability here in Africa, we could offer the people of the world a front row seat to Africa’s beauties and wonders without forcing them to confront the harsh reality and atmosphere of chaos that surrounds much of the continent. Tourism income shall become a new cornerstone of the Gabonese economy."

GAB_protected_wildlife:0 "Protected Wildlife"
GAB_protected_wildlife_desc:0 "Our wildlife is sacred. From the smallest hyrax to the largest elephants, the animal and plant life that form this beautiful ecosystem we live in are just as vital and important to our nation and our people as iron or air. Long have poaching, habitat destruction, and other vile practices sullied and tainted this Eden we call home. New protections shall be enacted and strictly enforced to ensure the wilds of Gabon survive and thrive for generations to come."

GAB_congo_attack_buff_desc:0 "The Manikongo to the south has invaded our borders, serving as ominous and ravenous heralds to the utter apocalypse that has reached Africa with the collapse of the German goliath. We must repel these savage tribesmen at all costs, for if we wait too long, their friends in Portugal might send aid!"

GAB_foreign_labour_idea:0 "Foreign Labour"
GAB_foreign_labour_idea_desc:0 "President M’ba has seen the writing on the wall - Gabon is a fragile and fledgling nation on a continent of chaos, and will need help if it is to survive. Though he will still go to great lengths to curtail any and all chances at internal dissent, he shall do so with a lighter hand to save face with his new partners as he plays nice with the French government in order to secure the necessary funding and aid Gabon needs to survive. Gabon may not need others, but their help shall certainly be taken when we can get it so easily."

GAB_dealing_with_corruption:0 "Dealing with Corruption"
GAB_dealing_with_corruption_desc:0 "With the German colonial apparatus dead, the M’ba regime overthrown, and the French colonialists largely outnumbered, we can finally take on the herculean task of quashing corruption within our republic once and for all. For too long have politicians, civil servants, military officials, and imperialists let their greed and ambitions run rampant within our borders. The Gabonese Republic will be cleansed of this sin."

GAB_church_support:0 "Support from the Church"
GAB_church_support_desc:0 "With the French came Catholicism, and despite M’ba’s attempts to snuff out pure Christian beliefs with his syncretic ideas, Catholicism still dominates the people of Gabon. We too are true sons and daughters of God, and as such, the Catholic Church has long been allowed to operate within our borders. Henceforth, we shall actively support the Church so that we may use it as a tool to strengthen this democratic republic we are creating."

GAB_kenyesianism:0 "Keynesianist Economics"
GAB_kenyesianism_desc:0 "Despite being a member of the ever-scheming Anglos, John Maynard Keynes has been making a splash in the wider international scene as a brilliant and near-clairvoyant economic theorist. His ideas, an evolution of the laissez-faire mindset that had taken hold of Britain before the revolution and the wider world since, is based on free market principles, social welfare systems, and anti-austerity stances, among a slew of other novel ideas. We should take a note from Keynes as we develop our new modern economy."

GAB_bush_warfare2:0 "Guerilla Warfare"
GAB_bush_warfare2_desc:0 "With their deep knowledge of the local terrain and with the new tactics we have developed instilled deeply in their hearts and minds, the Gabonese Defense and Security Forces have evolved into a fierce and ravenous fighting force. Each day, our militias raise from their volunteer’s barracks and drill the skills needed to defend our lands from any invader. With each drop of blood and sweat spilled, these Gabonese guerillas get one step closer to being the most feared fighting force in all of Central Africa!"

To combat this, we can simply remove the advantage the terrain may give them. With enough cannons and firebombs, even the deepest thicket can be cleared, along with any enemy troops hiding among the trees. We will turn the land to cinders and our foes to ash if we have to in order to protect our sovereignty. The trees will regrow, our enemies will not."

GAB_rain_fire2:0 "Raining Fire"
GAB_rain_fire2_desc:0 "With our newly defined doctrine and quietly acquired weapons of devastating destruction, we have the weapons of war within our hands necessary to defend Gabon at all costs. If any foe dares to try and sully our sense of sovereignty or tries to stifle our ambition, we shall unleash hell upon them. Shell by shell and bomb by bomb, we will tear apart the sky and send the very heavens crashing down upon the heads of our enemies, for nothing and no one will stop the Gabonese war machine."

GAB_debt:0 "Overwhelming Debts"
GAB_debt_desc:0 "Gabon’s financial system is upheld on the backs of large loans that have given Gabon the capital needed to create its virgin economy from scratch, but has also greatly hamstrung our attempts to do much of anything else. Our economy is young and fragile, and still lies largely in the hands of foreign investors and French benefactors. Until these debts are paid off, much of our excess profits will be going to paying off these loan sharks instead of building up our nation."

GAB_water_power_grid:0 "State Hydroelectricity"
GAB_water_power_grid_desc:0 "To quickly establish the needed basic infrastructure needed to build modern settlements and cities, we will need a system that can quickly and easily allocate funds and dictate demands without waiting for private business to build up or mess up. For now, Water and Power grids within Gabon will be run by the state until a time where some privatization can occur without causing destabilization."

GAB_oil_boom:0 "National Oil Boom"
GAB_oil_boom_desc:0 "With the oil fields off our coast now tapped, we must entice the world powers to join in on the Gabonese oil craze. Though it has its uses, we have tapped far more oil than we can currently consume, and to make any sort of net gain after all the funds we dumped into getting the operation started, we will have to sell this prized liquid on the international market. Though the big leagues may be brutal and unforgiving, it is where we are also likely to make the quickest and heftiest profit."

GAB_banks:0 "Banking System"
GAB_banks_desc:0 "We currently have no real widespread and unified financial system. What little we had that remained from the colonial regimes was obliterated in the chaos of the Mittelafrikan Collapse. The Gabonese financial bureaucracy will be built from the ground up as rapidly as possible in order to get the nation on the path to prosperity as quickly as possible, or at least keep us away from an economic meltdown."

GAB_international_regognition_idea_desc:0 "We must seek international recognition for our fledgling republic if we are ever to establish ourselves as a legitimate player on the world stage. Without the recognition of the major powers, our economy will languish as the wider global economy passes us by."

GAB_entente_trade_idea_desc:0 "We have decided to reach out to the Anglos, long a dominant player in Africa before the Revolution.

GAB_rp_trade_idea_desc:0 "Though their vile colonial monstrosity oppressed our people since the Weltkrieg, the German have proven to be adept at business when they are so enticed. Mittelafrika was doomed to fail, but our nation is not. They are the world hegemon for a reason, and cooperation with them would surely only raise the prosperity of our people, right?"

GAB_tourism_idea_desc:0 "Our nation is a beautiful and varied land, with thick monsoon forests that cover the Northern and Southern fringes and sprawling savannahs that stretch across our interior.

Tourism income shall become a new cornerstone of the Gabonese economy."

Across the sea in their far-off lands, their factories churn out endless goods and products aimed at making life easier or more enjoyable for their citizens while further advancing their economy’s towards greater heights of wealth and prosperity.
