Gabon_Focus:0 "Gabon Focus Tree"

### Focus tree ###
GAB_fall_of_the_iron_cross:0 "Fall of the Iron Cross"
GAB_fall_of_the_iron_cross_desc:0 "The Iron Cross that once stretched across the dark expanse of this massive continent has finally fallen - and with it the last shred of stability and peace left in Africa has gone along with it. We are a sea of Frenchmen and Africans lost amidst a sea of Krauts and chaos. We must tread carefully as we seek to establish our sovereignty here on the Equatorial Coast."

GAB_kick_out_the_congo:0 "Kick out the Kongo"
GAB_kick_out_the_congo_desc:0 "The Manikongo to the south has invaded our borders, serving as ominous and ravenous heralds to the utter apocalypse that has reached Africa with the collapse of the German goliath. We must repel these savage tribesmen at all costs, for if we wait too long, their friends in Portugal might send aid!"

GAB_open_recruitment:0 "Lower Our Recruitment Standards"
GAB_open_recruitment_desc:0 "If we are to drive back the Manikongo’s forces and preserve our newfound independence, we will need men to fill the ranks of our newly raised regiments. Historically, the defense force of our mighty colony has been selective with its troop intake, but the time for caution and strict standards is dead and gone. Now is the time for action as we fight for our survival!"

GAB_borrow_french_guns:0 "Requisition Guns from the French"
GAB_borrow_french_guns_desc:0 "With the fall of colonial rule, our access to the wider German economy has been cut off, and with it, we have also lost our easy access to new equipment. While raiding old caches and weapon-stores may be enough to outfit a few divisions, we will need a steady supply of firearms if we are to beat back the Kongo monarchists. We must make overtures to the Algerian Regime in order to sequester new weapons of war as we fight for our survival."

GAB_conscript_askari:0 "Conscript the Askari"
GAB_conscript_askari_desc:0 "The Askari that were once loyal to the Germans now find themselves with no benefactors nor allies in the wake of Mittelafrika’s demise. Though French colonial regimes rarely relied on these native mercenaries, now is not the time to be picky. We shall reach out to these aimless veterans and offer them a new deal - fight for the Gabonese army as our elite and specialized infantry force, or lose all benefits and rewards being an Askari once granted. Surely waving their pensions and right to vote in their faces will get them to jump to action!"

GAB_gabriels_cabal:0 "Gabriel's Cabal"
GAB_gabriels_cabal_desc:0 "Gabriel Léon M’ba rules as the first ‘president’ of an independent Gabon, though his regime already shows the tell tale signs of undemocratic practices and wider ambitions that lay outside the regular purview of a normal democracy’s limits on power. For M’ba, being president is not to better his fellow Gabonese, but to enrich himself and his associates as they run Gabon as their personal playground. Under this cabal, Gabon shall bend to the will of its first, and possibly last, president."

GAB_penal_labour:0 "Toil for the President"
GAB_penal_labour_desc:0 "President M’Ba has a long history of co-opting his followers and constituents to bend to his will, both mentally and physically. Implementing strategies and ideas he perfected during his time as ‘chef de canton’ of Libreville’s largest Fang burrough, M’ba shall finally have the workforce he desperately needs to build up Gabon’s fledgling economy. No one may deny the call to work from our President!"

GAB_reverse_apartheid:0 "Independence at Any Cost"
GAB_reverse_apartheid_desc:0 "President M’Ba, though a rabid Francophile, still seeks to establish Gabon as an independent and self-sufficient nation, free of any colonist aide or influence. To do this, Gabon shall be transformed into a beacon of autarky, and anyone that disagrees with these new edicts shall be dealt with accordingly. The assets of the remaining Huns will be seized, the press and civil liberties will be restricted, and any remaining colonialist holdouts resistant to our regime will be forced to work for our regime or face our wrath. Gabon needs no other!"

GAB_foreign_labour:0 "Accept Harsh Realities"
GAB_foreign_labour_desc:0 "President M’ba has seen the writing on the wall - Gabon is a fragile and fledgling nation on a continent of chaos, and will need help if it is to survive. Though he will still go to great lengths to curtail any and all chances at internal dissent, he shall do so with a lighter hand to save face with his new partners as he plays nice with the French government in order to secure the necessary funding and aid Gabon needs to survive. Gabon may not need others, but their help shall certainly be taken when we can get it so easily."

GAB_fang_supremacy:0 "Fang Supremacy"
GAB_fang_supremacy_desc:0 "Belonging to the wider Ekang subgroup of the Bantu people, the Fang are a some of the most numerous of the varied peoples of East-Central Africa, with their numbers spreading across Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Kamerun. Their dominance shall continue not only in number but through state policy as well, for President M’Ba, a Fang man himself, has begun to increasingly favor his native people in all matters of state policy. Ideas of Fang suprematism and Bantu extremism have begun to takehold through Gabon, and M’ba does not seem to show any signs of stopping it."

GAB_bwati_national_religion:0 "Embrace the Bwiti Faith"
GAB_bwati_national_religion_desc:0 "With the arrival of the French colonizers, Christianity quickly replaced Biere as the dominant religion of the various Gabonese people. With the return of native rule, interest in our native roots has exploded, with Biere also becoming incredibly popular again. However, more interesting has been the explosion in popularity of the syncretic Bwiti faith, a fusion of Christianity and Biere beliefs mixed with the ceremonial usage of psychedelics on specific holidays. With President M’ba, member of the Fang people who first practiced this new religion, even taking part in some of its beliefs and rituals, perhaps the time has come to fully embrace Bwiti as a national faith."

GAB_return_to_french_rule:0 "A French 'Constitution'"
GAB_return_to_french_rule_desc:0 "With the birth of this newly independent Gabonese ‘republic,’ a new constitution shall be needed for the nation, and what better system to emulate than the French. We have only witnessed firsthand how ineffectual the German system is, and with President M’Ba’s clear francophile sympathies already becoming apparent, the French system is the clear way to go for our people. Besides, our esteemed President can always make alterations to the document as needed. It is only a piece of paper after all."

GAB_join_entente:0 "Overtures to Old Allies"
GAB_join_entente_desc:0 "With our new government established and the foundations for President M’ba’s rule beginning to fully cement, it is time we established full contact with the rightful French regime who has long been Exiled to Algiers. The stench of syndialism shall not disgrace M’ba’s pure Gabon state, and the Entente and our old overlords shall be the perfect deterrent. We open our arms to our old allies!"

GAB_president_for_life:0 "L'Hyperprésident du Gabon"
GAB_president_for_life_desc:0 "Gabriel Léon M’ba has ruled over Gabon with an iron fist, but has always maintained an air of legitimacy and democracy. However, this all ends now as M’ba seeks to elevate himself past his current position as mere president. M’ba has higher aspirations in mind, and no small hurdles like voting or oppositional parties will stand in his way. M’ba shall rise to become the first ‘Hyperprésident du Gabon’ - a dictator in all but name, giving him the power to do as he pleased fully and totally for life."

GAB_paranoia_of_man:0 "The Paranoia of Man"
GAB_paranoia_of_man_desc:0 "Hyperprésident M’ba has narrowly survived the military coup aimed at ousting him from power, and with their failure, the dreams of a democratic Gabon die with them. Now the nation will know just how far their Hyperprésident is willing to go, for the paranoia has begun to fester within the mind of their great leader. M’ba will not rest until Gabon is safe and secure, for nothing will stand in the way of his insatiable lust for total dominance."

GAB_purge_the_military:0 "Cull the Traitors"
GAB_purge_the_military_desc:0 "The instrument of the failed coup was our military - long dominated by German sympathizers and democratic rabble. The entire Gabonese military shall be cleansed from the bottom-up,  with no traitor left standing nor any weakling left to sully our good name. Our military shall be forged to be as resolute and as dedicated to our survival as the Hyperprésident himself!"

GAB_blame_the_huns:0 "An Easy Scapegoat"
GAB_blame_the_huns_desc:0 "It was the Huns! Every single poor decision our administration has made, every misstep we have taken, every problem that ails our state, and ever mallady that plagues our people has been caused by these vile and incompetant Germans. Their colonial monstrosity is what oppressed us for so long and its collapse is what has thrown our very way of life into absolute chaos. Blame it all on the Huns, and let the people take their frustrations on the true culprit behind their woes!"

GAB_who_the_hell_needs_democracy:0 "Who the Hell Needs Democracy?"
GAB_who_the_hell_needs_democracy_desc:0 "Our glorious Hyperprésident has evolved past the need for democracy. The voice of the people only clouds his near-divine judgement while their incessant need for attention and direction only serves as a distraction to M’ba’s ambitious vision. The last semblances of democracy shall be cast off from Gabon, for the only opinion and word that matters now is the word of M’ba."

GAB_greater_kleptocracy:0 "What About Greater Kleptocracy?"
GAB_greater_kleptocracy_desc:0 "It has been no secret that from the very beginning of his entrance to politics, Gabriel M’ba has thirsted for self-satisfaction and profit above all else. He has openly declared at many a state function and gathering that he merely entered the political arena to make himself rich while pleasing his esteemed Évolué family. Now as Hyperprésident of this new Gabonese state, nothing can stand in his way as he turns the nation into a true and pure kleptocracy - one that entirely benefits himself above all others. Gabon shall be M’ba’s private playground as he endeavors to become the richest man in all of Africa!"

GAB_sucsesful_coup:0 "The Folly of Man"
GAB_sucsesful_coup_desc:0 "With his French benefactors leaving him to the wolves, President M’ba’s authoritarian kleptocracy has collapsed under the pressure of the Gabonese Defense and Security Forces. Now, under the protection of our military, true democracy shall be brought to the Gabonese people - a right stolen from them by the villainous M’ba."

GAB_rebuild_democratic_institutions:0 "Rebuild Democratic Institutions"
GAB_rebuild_democratic_institutions_desc:0 "The deposed ‘Hyperprésident’ M’ba suffocated and quashed virtually every institution, system, or check within our government that could be even thinly labeled ‘democratic.’ Under his rule, the Bloc Démocratique Gabonais became the sole party of our dying republic as M’ba transformed Gabon into a single-party kleptocracy fueled entirely by the Hyperprésident’s greed and ambition. We must weave true democratic ideals and practices back into the fabric of our nation lest the country unravel entirely."

GAB_reverse_the_madmans_policies:0 "Reverse the Madman's Policies"
GAB_reverse_the_madmans_policies_desc:0 "M’ba the madman has been deposed, but many of his vile policies remain. Ideas of Fang supremacism must be contained and suppressed while the other religions must be brought back as nationally accepted faiths to further foster unity in our fractured people. Press freedoms will return, and all further criticisms can be voiced against the legislation of the M’ba regime. We shall tear down his twisted legacy page by page until Gabon is finally free!"

GAB_aubuames_conservatives:0 "Aubame's UDSG"
GAB_aubuames_conservatives_desc:0 "In the first fair elections free from the tampering of the fallen Hyperprésident, Jean-Hilaire Aubame and his Union Démocratique et Sociale Gabonaise have taken hold of the nation. Once M’ba’s largest rival and critic before the creation of his one party state under the BDG, Aubame now leads a coalition of the remaining true conservatives left untainted by M’ba working with a slew of socially liberal, anti-socialist reformers. Taking inspiration from Louis Marin and the Fédération Républicaine and fusing it with our president’s own socially liberal, economically conservative ideas and faith, Aubame and the UDSG shall build Gabon up as a bastion of true Social-Christian republicanism."

GAB_crush_colonial_corruption:0 "Crush Colonial Corruption"
GAB_crush_colonial_corruption_desc:0 "With the German colonial apparatus dead, the M’ba regime overthrown, and the French colonialists largely outnumbered, we can finally take on the herculean task of quashing corruption within our republic once and for all. For too long have politicians, civil servants, military officials, and imperialists let their greed and ambitions run rampant within our borders. The Gabonese Republic will be cleansed of this sin."

GAB_tatical_investment:0 "Gabonese Civic Nationalism"
GAB_tatical_investment_desc:0 "In order to create a truly strong and united democratic atmosphere, we must actively work to include as many within our borders as possible. Gabon is land of various and distinct Bantu tribes, from the Estuaire and the Ogooué groups to the Nyanga and Woleu Ntem. These myriad ethnic bands, along with our minority Pygmy population, must all band together under ideas we can all share and have pride in. Our rights, our liberties, our shared cultures and identity as the Gabonese people shall unite us like no mere racially-motivated nationalism could. We are Gabonese, one and all!"

GAB_church_voulenteership:0 "Utilize the Church"
GAB_church_voulenteership_desc:0 "With the French came Catholicism, and despite M’ba’s attempts to snuff out pure Christian beliefs with his syncretic ideas, Catholicism still dominates the people of Gabon. We too are true sons and daughters of God, and as such, the Catholic Church has long been allowed to operate within our borders. Henceforth, we shall actively support the Church so that we may use it as a tool to strengthen this democratic republic we are creating."

GAB_church_tax_exemptions:0 "Social Catholicism"
GAB_church_tax_exemptions_desc:0 "The three pillars of a just and righteous society are human dignity, solidarity, and subsidiarity. These guiding principles shall form the cornerstone of our pious new democracy, as we endeavor to both respect the rights and abilities of our people. The Lord is our Saviour, and we are His children - may His doctrine guide us as we strive to create a fair and just society that knows limits and good Christian morals."

GAB_in_god_we_trust:0 "Dieu et la Liberté"
GAB_in_god_we_trust_desc:0 "Under President Aubame, Gabon has been transformed into a stable and moral democratic haven here on the Dark Continent. Utilizing ideas from the French colonizers’ more enlightened and ethical thinkers and fusing them with our own unique Gabonese spirit, we have created a pious, steadfast, and resilient republic that no longer bears the dark mark of the M’ba regime or the Kaiser’s greed. Gabon is free and safe at last, under God."

GAB_gondouts_liberals:0 "Gondjout’s PDG"
GAB_gondouts_liberals_desc:0 "In the first fair elections free from the tampering of the fallen Hyperprésident, Paul Marie Indjendjet Gondjout and his Parti Démocratique Gabonais have taken back their seats as the rightful rules of the nation as they strip their party of any and all traces of the Hyperprésident’s regime. Once the leader of the centre-right BDG before M’ba seized power and stole party leadership from him, Gondjout now leads a coalition of liberal economists, Secular conservatives, and Pro-Westernization groups left untainted by M’ba. Taking inspiration from the Alliance Démocratique and from theorists such as Paul Reynaud and Pierre Étienne-Flandin and fusing it with his own beliefs, our new President and the PDG shall build Gabon up as a true embodiment of pluralistic and profitable democracy."

GAB_western_investment:0 "French-Inspired Liberalism"
GAB_western_investment_desc:0 "Our republic shares the same roots and lineage of the heroes of the French Revolution, the great Enlightenment thinkers, and the titans of French Liberalism from Montesquieu and Constant to de Staël and Reynaud. Ideas such as the separation of powers, inherent civil rights and liberties, true democratic republicanism, capitalist enterprise, and so much more form the foundation of our Republic’s very existence. This legacy shall become the foundation of our new government as we work to bring true liberty to the Gabonese people."

GAB_westernization_first:0 "Westernization First"
GAB_westernization_first_desc:0 "Though it may be hard to accept for many within our nation, we need the West and their modern ideas if we are to survive in the world order they have created. Westernization and modernization must be top priorities of the state, for if we fall behind any farther, our opportunistic neighbors or foreign imperialists will come knocking once more."

GAB_satisfy_basic_needs:0 "Meeting the Needs of the People"
GAB_satisfy_basic_needs_desc:0 "It is the basic goal of a government to provide the basic needs of its people, but the M’ba regime and the colonialist establishments of the past both failed to do even this most basic and fundamental task - this must change. Our citizens, as rightful members of this Gabonese Republic, have certain inalienable rights that the state must protect and deliver upon. It is time we had a government that truly cared for and respected its people and we can provide for them without giving falling to radicalism and giving into deceit like the silver-tongued leftists that seek to undermine our rule."

GAB_tip_from_kenyesianism:0 "A Tip from Keynesianism"
GAB_tip_from_kenyesianism_desc:0 "Despite being a member of the ever-scheming Anglos, John Maynard Keynes has been making a splash in the wider international scene as a brilliant and near-clairvoyant economic theorist. His ideas, an evolution of the laissez-faire mindset that had taken hold of Britain before the revolution and the wider world since, is based on free market principles, social welfare systems, and anti-austerity stances, among a slew of other novel ideas. We should take a note from Keynes as we develop our new modern economy."

GAB_free_market:0 "Union, Travail, Justice"
GAB_free_market_desc:0 "Under President Gondjout, Gabon has been transformed from an underdeveloped, humanitarian nightmare into steadily growing economic paradise where profit and liberty are paramount virtues. This secular, shining republic has fully washed clean the decay and toxic residue left over from the M’ba regime and the Krauts, and the people of Gabon rejoice for it. Liberty rings across our union, for working together towards prosperity and profit has brought true justice and freedom to the Gabonese people."

GAB_entente_question:0 "Old ‘Friends’ or New Horizons?"
GAB_entente_question_desc:0 "Well before the Iron Cross of the Kaiserreich rose over Africa, the French ruled these lands we call home, and all the while we lived under their rule, their culture melded with ours and became part of who we are. When the Hun fell, Hyperprésident M’ba one more reached out to the French to make overtures, and in doing so, secured their aid. Now, M’ba is gone and we rule Gabon, so we must make a choice: stay aligned with our former overlords and the regime that backed a destructive madman, or find our own way?"

GAB_pierres_socialists:0 "Goura’s GDSR"
GAB_pierres_socialists_desc:0 "In the first fair elections free from the tampering of the fallen Hyperprésident, Pierre Goura and his Groupe de l'Union Démocratique et Socialiste have won a surprise victory over the more moderate candidates, and now seeks to put Gabon on the road to Socialism. Heavily influenced by Marceau Pivert and his radical Parti Socialiste Ouvrier et Paysan, Goura shall bring the red beacon of Syndicalism and Socialism here to Gabon, but heavily altered to fit the realities of our underdeveloped nation and with a unwavering dedication to true democracy. The Gabon proletariat shall finally be free under President Goura as he welcomes the Red Tide to our shores."

GAB_break_the_colonial_shackles:0 "Break the Shackles of Colonialism"
GAB_break_the_colonial_shackles_desc:0 "With the victory of President Goura and the GDSR, one of the state’s most pressing concerns has been to crush the last vestiges of colonialism influence within the nation, namely from the previous German and imperialist French regimes. Many of our institutions and systems still bear the marks and scars of colonialist greed and imperial inequalities. The last of these traces must be eradicated and replaced with more equitable and fair institutions that are capable of accurately providing for our people with the allure of corruption and personal gain getting in the way. The Gabonese people are free, it is time we started living like it."

GAB_true_agrarianism:0 "Afro-Syndicalist Agrarianism"
GAB_true_agrarianism_desc:0 "Though we are inspired by the successes of the Commune in Paris and their progress towards benefiting mankind, many of their policies would not work in a nation in our current state. Their emphasis on industrialization and urbanization shall be dialed back and replaced with emphasis on mechanized agriculture as we bend their ideas and fuse them with our own to create a new, uniquely African solution to our situation. Agrarianism shall be embraced fully with a focus on animal husbandry more so over large scale crop-farming as we slowly build up small amounts of modern industry, particularly in manganese mining and timber harvesting, in the background. This will allow us to craft a new, worker-orientated economy where the realities of our situation and the needs of the people are both taken into account."

GAB_voluntary_collectives:0 "Voluntary Collectives"
GAB_voluntary_collectives_desc:0 "Democracy is sacred, and our people have their inherent rights that we can not infringe upon. However, our regime still thinks that collectivization of at least some sectors, particular within our agricultural departments, would do wonders to both our economy and our population’s sense of freedom and agency. To this end, a completely voluntary system of collectivization shall begin, with those that participate receiving generous benefits from the state to incentivize more volunteers. Gabon’s agricultural sector, at least in part, will no longer be dominated by wage-slavers and workplace bureaucracy."

GAB_disband_askari:0 "A Red Militia"
GAB_disband_askari_desc:0 "Despite whatever reforms we shall undertake to transform the Gabonese armed forces into a formidable and reliable fighting force, a more localized force could prove to be extremely useful in the event of another military or foreign-backed coup like we all witnessed during the M’ba regime. A Red militia should be formed, taking volunteers from collectives and cooperatives throughout the nation, to serve as the last line of defense between Gabon and utter chaos if hard times should ever reach us again. These dedicated, loyal, and fervent supporters of our regime shall serve Gabon proudly!"

GAB_african_comrades:0 "Socialist Democracy and Comradery"
GAB_african_comrades_desc:0 "We have achieved the mandate of our rule democratically, and we will respect that mandate no matter our goals or ambitions. Democracy must be maintained at all costs, even if the people’s mandate changes hands and we are voted out, no matter how righteous and true our egalitarian cause may be. To ensure that we are reelected for terms to come to continue on our Socialist endeavor, we must earn the people’s trust and adoration while also building a combined sense of unity both within our own nation and with our African neighbors - regardless of their positions. Only together can Gabon and all of Africa be free."

GAB_red_africanism:0 "Red Africanism"
GAB_red_africanism_desc:0 "The Continent of Africa is vast, and much of our fellow Africans have yet to embrace or even think about the prospects of Socialism. We must be the heralds of this great awakening, for Socialism is the saviour they need but do not know it. We shall ride into this Red Dawn with the rest of our brothers and sisters in tow, for the Age of Imperialism is over, and the Age of Red Africa has only just begun..."

GAB_contact_the_real_france:0 "L'Internationale Sera le Genre Africain"
GAB_contact_the_real_france_desc:0 "Our Socialist foundation has been established under the wise and fair rule of President Goura, and now it is time to showcase our progress to the wider world. The Internationale, led by the rightful French government, is half a world away, and yet, they are our best hope at salvation. We shall reach out to their government, not as a former colony but as equals, and discuss matters of reconciliation and cooperation. Workers of the world unite!"
