Gabon_Focus:0 "Gabon Focus Tree"

### Focus tree ###
GAB_fall_of_the_iron_cross:0 "Fall of the Iron Cross"
GAB_fall_of_the_iron_cross_desc:0 "The Iron Cross that once stretched across the dark expanse of this massive continent has finally fallen - and with it the last shred of stability and peace left in Africa has gone along with it. We are a sea of Frenchmen and Africans lost amidst a sea of Krauts and chaos. We must tread carefully as we seek to establish our sovereignty here on the Equatorial Coast."

GAB_kick_out_the_congo:0 "Kick out the Kongo"
GAB_kick_out_the_congo_desc:0 "The Manikongo to the south has invaded our borders, serving as ominous and ravenous heralds to the utter apocalypse that has reached Africa with the collapse of the German goliath. We must repel these savage tribesmen at all costs, for if we wait too long, their friends in Portugal might send aid!"

GAB_open_recruitment:0 "Lower Our Recruitment Standards"
GAB_open_recruitment_desc:0 "If we are to drive back the Manikongo’s forces and preserve our newfound independence, we will need men to fill the ranks of our newly raised regiments. Historically, the defense force of our mighty colony has been selective with its troop intake, but the time for caution and strict standards is dead and gone. Now is the time for action as we fight for our survival!"

GAB_borrow_french_guns:0 "Requisition Guns from the French"
GAB_borrow_french_guns_desc:0 "With the fall of colonial rule, our access to the wider German economy has been cut off, and with it, we have also lost our easy access to new equipment. While raiding old caches and weapon-stores may be enough to outfit a few divisions, we will need a steady supply of firearms if we are to beat back the Kongo monarchists. We must make overtures to the Algerian Regime in order to sequester new weapons of war as we fight for our survival."

GAB_conscript_askari:0 "Conscript the Askari"
GAB_conscript_askari_desc:0 "The Askari that were once loyal to the Germans now find themselves with no benefactors nor allies in the wake of Mittelafrika’s demise. Though French colonial regimes rarely relied on these native mercenaries, now is not the time to be picky. We shall reach out to these aimless veterans and offer them a new deal - fight for the Gabonese army as our elite and specialized infantry force, or lose all benefits and rewards being an Askari once granted. Surely waving their pensions and right to vote in their faces will get them to jump to action!"

GAB_gabriels_cabal:0 "Gabriel's Cabal"
GAB_gabriels_cabal_desc:0 "Gabriel Léon M’ba rules as the first ‘president’ of an independent Gabon, though his regime already shows the tell tale signs of undemocratic practices and wider ambitions that lay outside the regular purview of a normal democracy’s limits on power. For M’ba, being president is not to better his fellow Gabonese, but to enrich himself and his associates as they run Gabon as their personal playground. Under this cabal, Gabon shall bend to the will of its first, and possibly last, president."

GAB_penal_labour:0 "Toil for the President"
GAB_penal_labour_desc:0 "President M’Ba has a long history of co-opting his followers and constituents to bend to his will, both mentally and physically. Implementing strategies and ideas he perfected during his time as ‘chef de canton’ of Libreville’s largest Fang burrough, M’ba shall finally have the workforce he desperately needs to build up Gabon’s fledgling economy. No one may deny the call to work from our President!"

GAB_reverse_apartheid:0 "Independence at Any Cost"
GAB_reverse_apartheid_desc:0 "President M’Ba, though a rabid Francophile, still seeks to establish Gabon as an independent and self-sufficient nation, free of any colonist aide or influence. To do this, Gabon shall be transformed into a beacon of autarky, and anyone that disagrees with these new edicts shall be dealt with accordingly. The assets of the remaining Huns will be seized, the press and civil liberties will be restricted, and any remaining colonialist holdouts resistant to our regime will be forced to work for our regime or face our wrath. Gabon needs no other!"

GAB_foreign_labour:0 "Accept Harsh Realities"
GAB_foreign_labour_desc:0 "President M’ba has seen the writing on the wall - Gabon is a fragile and fledgling nation on a continent of chaos, and will need help if it is to survive. Though he will still go to great lengths to curtail any and all chances at internal dissent, he shall do so with a lighter hand to save face with his new partners as he plays nice with the French government in order to secure the necessary funding and aid Gabon needs to survive. Gabon may not need others, but their help shall certainly be taken when we can get it so easily."

GAB_fang_supremacy:0 "Fang Supremacy"
GAB_fang_supremacy_desc:0 "Belonging to the wider Ekang subgroup of the Bantu people, the Fang are a some of the most numerous of the varied peoples of East-Central Africa, with their numbers spreading across Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Kamerun. Their dominance shall continue not only in number but through state policy as well, for President M’Ba, a Fang man himself, has begun to increasingly favor his native people in all matters of state policy. Ideas of Fang suprematism and Bantu extremism have begun to takehold through Gabon, and M’ba does not seem to show any signs of stopping it."

GAB_bwati_national_religion:0 "Embrace the Bwiti Faith"
GAB_bwati_national_religion_desc:0 "With the arrival of the French colonizers, Christianity quickly replaced Biere as the dominant religion of the various Gabonese people. With the return of native rule, interest in our native roots has exploded, with Biere also becoming incredibly popular again. However, more interesting has been the explosion in popularity of the syncretic Bwiti faith, a fusion of Christianity and Biere beliefs mixed with the ceremonial usage of psychedelics on specific holidays. With President M’ba, member of the Fang people who first practiced this new religion, even taking part in some of its beliefs and rituals, perhaps the time has come to fully embrace Bwiti as a national faith."

GAB_return_to_french_rule:0 "A French Constitution"
GAB_return_to_french_rule_desc:0 "With the birth of this newly independent Gabonese ‘republic,’ a new constitution shall be needed for the nation, and what better system to emulate than the French. We have only witnessed firsthand how ineffectual the German system is, and with President M’Ba’s clear francophile sympathies already becoming apparent, the French system is the clear way to go for our people. Besides, our esteemed President can always make alterations to the document as needed. It is only a piece of paper after all."

GAB_join_entente:0 "Overtures to Old Allies"
GAB_join_entente_desc:0 "With our new government established and the foundations for President M’ba’s rule beginning to fully cement, it is time we established full contact with the rightful French regime who has long been Exiled to Algiers. The stench of syndialism shall not disgrace M’ba’s pure Gabon state, and the Entente and our old overlords shall be the perfect deterrent. We open our arms to our old allies!"

GAB_president_for_life:0 "L'Hyperprésident du Gabon"
GAB_president_for_life_desc:0 "Gabriel Léon M’ba has ruled over Gabon with an iron fist, but has always maintained an air of legitimacy and democracy. However, this all ends now as M’ba seeks to elevate himself past his current position as mere president. M’ba has higher aspirations in mind, and no small hurdles like voting or oppositional parties will stand in his way. M’ba shall rise to become the first ‘Hyperprésident du Gabon’ - a dictator in all but name, giving him the power to do as he pleased fully and totally for life."

GAB_paranoia_of_man:0 "The Paranoia of Man"
GAB_paranoia_of_man_desc:0 "Hyperprésident M’ba has narrowly survived the military coup aimed at ousting him from power, and with their failure, the dreams of a democratic Gabon die with them. Now the nation will know just how far their Hyperprésident is willing to go, for the paranoia has begun to fester within the mind of their great leader. M’ba will not rest until Gabon is safe and secure, for nothing will stand in the way of his insatiable lust for total dominance."

GAB_purge_the_military:0 "Cull the Traitors"
GAB_purge_the_military_desc:0 "The instrument of the failed coup was our military - long dominated by German sympathizers and democratic rabble. The entire Gabonese military shall be cleansed from the bottom-up,  with no traitor left standing nor any weakling left to sully our good name. Our military shall be forged to be as resolute and as dedicated to our survival as the Hyperprésident himself!"

GAB_blame_the_huns:0 "An Easy Scapegoat"
GAB_blame_the_huns_desc:0 "It was the Huns! Every single poor decision our administration has made, every misstep we have taken, every problem that ails our state, and ever mallady that plagues our people has been caused by these vile and incompetant Germans. Their colonial monstrosity is what oppressed us for so long and its collapse is what has thrown our very way of life into absolute chaos. Blame it all on the Huns, and let the people take their frustrations on the true culprit behind their woes!"

GAB_who_the_hell_needs_democracy:0 "Who the Hell Needs Democracy?"
GAB_who_the_hell_needs_democracy_desc:0 "Our glorious Hyperprésident has evolved past the need for democracy. The voice of the people only clouds his near-divine judgement while their incessant need for attention and direction only serves as a distraction to M’ba’s ambitious vision. The last semblances of democracy shall be cast off from Gabon, for the only opinion and word that matters now is the word of M’ba."

GAB_greater_kleptocracy:0 "What About Greater Kleptocracy?"
GAB_greater_kleptocracy_desc:0 "It has been no secret that from the very beginning of his entrance to politics, Gabriel M’ba has thirsted for self-satisfaction and profit above all else. He has openly declared at many a state function and gathering that he merely entered the political arena to make himself rich while pleasing his esteemed Évolué family. Now as Hyperprésident of this new Gabonese state, nothing can stand in his way as he turns the nation into a true and pure kleptocracy - one that entirely benefits himself above all others. Gabon shall be M’ba’s private playground as he endeavors to become the richest man in all of Africa!"
