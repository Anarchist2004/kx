### Events ###
arizona.1.t:0 "The Status of Goldwater's Revolt"
arizona.1.d:0 "When the Mexicans crossed the Mountains to the south, crushed the remains of the Western command centre and installed garrisons in their occupied territories they must have assumed they were here to stay. When bandit groups began harassing Mexican supply convoys they sent more troops into the cities, when a former National guard Armory was raided they increased their efforts to round up Anglo dissidents. For a time Arizona fell silent with the Occupation forces assuming that Arizona was pacified, the Mexicans pulled forces out of Pheonix and Tuscon to reinforce the pacification efforts across the other south western states. \n\nTo former WCC officer and Current leader of a notorious bandit group Barry Goldwater this is a prime opportunity, using his near mythological status among the Mexican army as 'The man of gold and water' to bring together the Arizona rangers, WCC and National guard Remnants and even a sizable force of Natives from the Navajo nation, forging them into the South West Liberation Front, an army worthy of the state of Arizona. With fires staring all across the Mexican occupied territories and the forces of the SWLF infiltrating key cities across the state there has never been a better time to free Arizona from the shackles of the perfidious Mexican"
arizona.1.a:0 "To Arms!"

arizona.2.t:0 "Peace"
arizona.2.d:0 "All over Arizona the guns are beginning to fall silent, with the Mexican army retreating over the Patagonia Mountains and along Interstate 19 its beginning to look like Goldwater's revolt has succeeded, though there are still Mexican holdouts close to the borders, with their supply lines cut and their collaborators being rounded up for deportation they aren't expected to last much longer. With the SWLF Provisional government establishing control across the state and beginning reconstruction efforts people are beginning to expect a return to normalcy and democracy. Goldwater has so far continued the SWLF provisional government and with his growing status as a war hero and liberator some are beginning to worry what will happen when the Emergency government is no longer needed"
arizona.2.a:0 "Freedom, at last. Right?"

arizona.3.t:0 "Restoration of Democracy?"
arizona.3.d:0 "With the formal ceasefire between the Provisional government and Mexico there has been a drastic increase in calls to end the state of Emergency and hold democratic elections, with the loudest of voices coming from the Former state senator Robert Taylor Jones, who helped fund Goldwater's rebellion with his vast wealth gathered through pharmaceuticals, Jones insists that the only way an Arizona government can be legitimate is if power is returned to the state legislature and a Governor is elected. A Clique of Hardline officers within the SWLF However have proposed an alterative solution, to extend the state of Emergency and expand Goldwater's powers to ensure that never again will Mexican boots stomp over Arizona's freedom, while Goldwater is aware that the Mexicans are still in the south, waiting for the perfect time to strike once more he also knows that this decision would be received very poorly by the State Legislature, furthermore he knows that the South west liberation front is made up of many different groups, some of which have openly supported the restoration of Democracy, were the state of emergency to be extended it seems likely there would be resistance, on the Other hand, if this newly democratic government was too weak to resist the Mexican beast all of his work would have been for nothing. "
arizona.3.a:0 "So be it, Call Elections"
arizona.3.b:0 "The Mexican threat still looms, Extend the State of Emergency" 

arizona.4.t:0 "Goldwater Consolidates Power"
arizona.4.d:0 "It was early in the morning when the Raids began, all across Pheonix the most prominent faces of the growing democratic movement were being arrested, with a gun battle breaking out on the steps of the State capital building between Militias loyal to the State senate and National guard forces loyal to Goldwater. By midday the story had been spread to every corner of the State with the Broadcast of Barry Goldwater's speech. According to SWLF intelligence agents, Robert Taylor Jones and several members of the state Legislature and fringe members of the SWLF had been potting to assassinate Goldwater and seize command of the Provisional Government in response to Goldwater's short term extension of the state of emergency, they intended to sell Arizona back to the Mexicans in return for wealth and political appointments in their new regime. Unharmed though shaken by the Experience, Goldwater announced that he has no choice but to extend his emergency powers indefinitely, citing the continued interference of Mexico on Arizonan safety, furthermore the SWLF will be reorganised into the First Arizona Army"
arizona.4.a:0 "Long Live Goldwater!"

arizona.5.t:0 "Elections to be Held"
arizona.5.d:0 "With civilian rule restored to Arizona the political machine has started up again, though dozens of fringe parties have sprouted from the chaos of the Mexican occupation and American civil war it appears as if the most prominent will be the Establishment parties, with Robert Taylor Jones, focusing on his plans to expand the railways all across Arizona turning to his old allies in the Democrat party for their nomination and support, and War hero Barry Goldwater who has aligned with the republican party with his promise to Desegrate the state and present a hardline policy against Mexican aggression in the south. Some have begun to question just how closely the establishment parties will cooperate with their Equivalents in the Wider American sphere, but it seems for now that that decision will be left in the hands of the President of Arizona."
arizona.5.a:0 "As it should be"

arizona.6.t:0 "General Election of [GetYear]"
arizona.6.d:0 "The day has finally come, with Patriotic citizens stretching across Arizona coming together to patriciate in the first free and fair election since before the civil war, this election is shaping up to be a successful transition of power out of the Emergency government, though the Campaigns of the two Presidential candidates have been fierce, with Goldwater accusing Jones of cowardice, citing Jones inaction during the rebellion as well as his own status as a war hero, while Jones accused Goldwater of  wanting to echo Macarthur and reminded the public of his vast donations to the reconstruction effort. Though the mood in Pheonix is tense the SWLF has been deployed to ensure that the more violent members of the opposing sides don't cause trouble, and so far violence has been prevented from breaking out. All that's left now is for the people to decide who they want to become the first president of a free Arizona Republic"
arizona.6.a:0 "Goldwater Wins a Smashing Victory!"
arizona.6.b:0 "Robert Taylor Jones claims the Position of President"
