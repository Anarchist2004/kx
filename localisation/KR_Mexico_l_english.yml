### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_EMILIANO_ZAPATA_DESC:0 "Serving as a hero and leading figure within the bloody Mexican Revolution, Emiliano Zapata is one of the most respected, as well as one of the most divisive, figures in the nation. Born in Morelos in 1879, Emiliano Zapata Salazar was born into a well-off and popular family of mestizo famers. This rural upbringing greatly influenced his later views, but despite popular claims that he began life as an impoverished child of native blood, Zapata’s upbringing was decently comfortable. Regardless, after receiving basic education and with the death of his father while Zapata was just 16, the future hero of Mexico was forced to shoulder the burden of caring for his family, starting off on a series of odd jobs and entrepreneurial ventures. \nWith the rise of the Porfirio Díaz regime, Zapata and his local town of Anenecuilco - long a hotbed of anti-elitist thought - began to once more vigorously protest the expanding hacienda system, and after meeting with Díaz to a discuss possible deal, Zapata and his allies were arrested and conscripted into the Federal Army - a sentence that would come to benefit him given the great martial experience it granted him. After returning home, Zapata was elected as the new chief elder of his hometown with the retirement of Josė Merino, and would continue to rally his allies against the hacienda system and against the Díaz regime until the Mexican Revolution finally broke out a few years later. Allying with Pancho Villa and later Álvaro Obregón, Zapata proved to be a masterful guerilla tactician, and with his help, the Socialists came out victorious in the war. \nFollowing the Mexican Revolution and after three back-to-back PLM presidents, Zapata broke their political monopoly and achieved victory in Mexico's 1932 Presidential election with his PNA. Since taking office, he has promoted the development of Mexico's collective farms, 'Ejidos', and through economic incentives and with Mexican oil on offer, has fostered close diplomatic ties with the Third Internationale. However, his vaguely Socialist stances and deeply Socialist allies have angered many, causing radical anti-Socialists and antagonized democratic elements to assemble and take action across the nation. With instability and civil strife rearing their ugly heads once more, Zapata and his regime must take care, for a coming storm is brewing over Mexico once more."
POLITICS_PLUTARCO_CALLES_DESC:0 "General Plutarco Calles has seized control of the Mexican government. While the totalitarian and rabidly anti-clerical tone of Calles's rhetoric are typical of Mexican socialist politicians, his rejection of agrarianism and support for full integration of indigenous Mexicans could represent a radical new direction for Mexico if implemented."
POLITICS_PANCHO_VILLA_DESC:0 "Francisco 'Pancho' Villa's military victories against the armies of dictator Victoriano Huerta, such critical steps on the path to socialist revolution in Mexico, remain legendary in Mexico and abroad. Villa, while often at odds with Zapata, is similarly an agrarian socialist."
POLITICS_PABLO_GONZALEZ_GARZA_DESC:0 "General Pablo Gonzalez Garza was once a steadfast ally of former president Carranza. With the death of Carranza and the ascent of Alvaro Obregón to the Mexican presidency, he went into hiding, waiting for the opportune moment to cleanse his beloved Mexico of socialist corruption; with the success of a military coup in Mexico, he is poised to do just that."
POLITICS_JOSE_URQUIZA_DESC:0 "Jose Antonia Urquiza, fervent catholic and anti-socialist, has outmaneuvred his ostensible allies within the Mexican military to assume control of the presidency. President Urquiza is as certain to promote faith in his Sinarquist regime as faith in God Himself."
POLITICS_VINCENTE_TOLEDANO_DESC:0 "Vicente Toledano, personal aide and confidant of former president, Zapata, has now become president in his own right. He advocates a synthesis between European style syndicalism and Mexican agrarianism, whereby the state supports the industrialisation and unionisation of the collectivised farms, 'Ejidos'."
POLITICS_LAZARO_CARDENAS_DESC:0 "Lazaro Cardenas of the moderate Partido Revolucionario Institucional has achieved victory in Mexico's presidential election. His platform is of reconciliation with Zapatistas and the Catholic Church alike."
POLITICS_DONA_ITURBIDE_DESC:0 "Doña María Josephia Sophia de Habsburgo-Itúrbide has been crowned Empress of the new Mexican Monarchy. She traces descent from both Mexico's final indigenous Emperor and the adopted son of Maximillian. As an Austrian, her ascension to the throne has fostered closer ties between Austria and Mexico."
POLITICS_DON_FERNANDO:0 "Don Fernando de Tultengo has been crowned King of Mexico. His legitimacy is based upon descent from the final Aztec Tlatoani, Moctezuma, and thus he lacks the dynastic links which could entangle the fate of Mexico with that of another."

### Ideas ###
MEX_new_economic_policy_idea:0 "Nueva Política Económica"
MEX_new_economic_policy_idea_desc:0 "The Nueva Política Económica, or NEP, was created by the post-Revolutionary government as an expediency measure aimed at breathing life into our war-ravaged economy. Mixing state-run Socialist and small-scale Capitalist policies together into a cohesive and syncretic economic plan, the NEP has been a shaky attempt by the new regime to forcibly bring prosperity to Mexico. Using both free market and nationalized industries and methods, the NEP has been met with mixed results, and now the nation must decide whether to continue these drastic, fused policies, or must a Great Break be organized to dive Mexico headfirst into its crimson future."

MEX_revolution_economic:0 "The Revolution’s Economic Fallout"
MEX_revolution_economic_desc:0 "The Revolución Mexicana blew apart the old order and from the ashes our new society has risen, but this crimson transformation did not come without a price. The revolution completely destabilized and reshaped the nation, and has taken a heavy toll on Mexico’s overall ability to function, primarily when it comes to our economic sector which was absolutely decimated in the conflict. Our industry was ravaged and scavenged by fighters and opportunists on all sides, roads, railways, and telegraph lines are in ruin, and those farms and ranches that weren't ransacked by Zapata's militias were burned in a Scorched Earth policy to starve out the revolution. It will take an extensive and thorough reconstruction effort to stitch the country back together again and restore Mexico's economy to working order."

MEX_revolution_military:0 "Outdated and Unmotivated Military"
MEX_revolution_military_desc:0 "Mexico has seemingly been cursed for the better part of a century with an inability to properly modernize, industrialize, or militarize, with the woefully underdeveloped state of our armed forces serving as a blatant and sore example of this ineptitude. From doctrine to logistics and even up the entire chain of command, the whole of Mexico's military might is compromised. This military inadequacy has progressed to the point that Mexico might be markedly unprepared for the realities that another major conflict would bring. \n\nWe face a harsh reality - half of our own armaments date back to the first Weltkrieg or earlier as literal museum pieces, the navy is little more than a boutique fleet defending our closest coastal waters and interior waterways, and the air force is all but non-existent. However, not all hope is lost. With the Revolution having wrested control of the nation's industry and with the increased attention paid to the nation’s domestic oil wealth, it is possible, and vital, that Mexico evolve beyond the ad hoc nature of Zapata's militias and towards a more modern and efficient military structure."

MEX_asa_rebellion:0 "Rebellion of the Anti-Socialist Alliance"
MEX_asa_rebellion_desc:0 "Since the Revolution toppled the regime of Victoriano Huerta and Porfirio Díaz, Mexico has seen new faces rise and fall until war hero Emiliano Zapata was elected, with each new leader attempting to drive the post-Revolutionary state into their desired direction. All along the way and regardless of who held the reigns of power, the nation has been plagued with an increasingly radicalized right-wing coalition of anti-Socialist nationalist cliques. \n\nComposed of a wide array of right-wing and far-right movements, the ASA is chiefly represented by the staunchly traditionalist militia of the Partido Nacional Integralista (PNI), the ultra-religious synarchists of the Partido Fuerza Popular (PFP) and the racial ideologues of the anti-clerical, anti-establishment Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista (ARM), and along with other smaller groups, this anti-Leftist coalition shares little in common aside from their shared hate for Socialism. While the right-wing triumvirate is far from a stable alliance, with both the PNI and PFP loudly voicing their disdain for the ARM, their presence shows an ever growing antipathy with the revolutionary government of Zapata and the Syndicalists. With their attacks only growing more bold as the Red regime continues to lord over Mexico, many fear the ASA will plunge the nation back into war. If these ultra-nationalist fifth columnists aren't dealt with swiftly, Mexico might find itself at the mercy of yet another counter-revolution."

MEX_dl_opposition:0 "Opposition from the Liga Demócrata"
MEX_dl_opposition_desc:0 "Although the transition of power in Mexico to a Socialist Republic was far from peaceful, the election of 1932 that saw Zapata's rise to power meant that the ex-incumbents of the former republican establishment would once again be relegated as a fringe group, leaving them as a marginalized but very vocal political opponent dedicated to serve as a roadblock to anything the Socialist government intended to put forward. Making matters worse, it is not just the conservative right of the previous establishment that are against the government of Zapata, for many liberal and moderate politicians and parties are joining the Liga Demócrata, voicing their desires for change. Harkening back to the Carrancistas of the Revolution, these republicans and constitutionalists believe the sitting government to be one step too close to mob rule. The current administration certainly has a lot of work to do to broker an accommodation with these whimpering republicans, lest the infantile Socialist regime suffer yet another setback on their path to securing Mexico's political future."

MEX_church_question:0 "The Question of the Church"
MEX_church_question_desc:0 "Since the days of the original Spanish Conquest, the presence of the Catholic Church has had a profound and ever-present influence on the culture and traditions of contemporary Mexico. Although the Syndicalist government of Zapata has made a concerted effort to secularize Mexico, the Catholic Church still holds great power over the hearts and minds of the Mexican People. It is clear that, unless some kind of an accord with the clergy and it's faithful laity is met, a more direct and forceful means of addressing the "Opiate of the People" may have to be contemplated. Until then, the secular and pious populations of our state are at each other's throats, and with baseless rumors spreading that Zapata wishes to push for full anti-clericalism as pro-Church groups continue to radicalize, Mexico has been pushed to balance on a razor’s edge."

MEX_urbanization_desc:0 "The economic growth that our nation has experienced in the last few years has focused a lot of it's economic activity in the cities, which has in turned increased their population, to the point they no longer can hold their populations while upholding social benefits, welfare and services. We shall begin a program of urbanisation with the benefit of our citizens in mind, and hopefully improve their quality of life."
MEX_infrastructure_act:0 "Infrastructure Act"
MEX_infrastructure_act_desc:0 "Mexico has a very rough terrain which has made private efforts to improve the national infrastructure unprofitable for their interests. With this in mind, we have to enact an infrastructure act with the goal of improving logistics within our country, after all, no one's going to do it for us..."
MEX_federalism:0 "Federalism"
MEX_federalism_desc:0 "Mexico has, for some time now, being a federal nation, with many states. However, most of them used to be submitted to a central power which directed them all, leading to a very inefficient bureaucracy. We shall take steps to secure the federal system and empower each individual state."
MEX_teacher_unions:0 "Strengthen Teacher Unions"
MEX_teacher_unions_desc:0 "Teacher's Unions have been fighting for better budgets for education since 1919. Considering the changes in administration we have gone through since then, it would be fair if we fulfilled their demands and granted them further funding."
MEX_empower_unions:0 "Empower Unions"
MEX_empower_unions_desc:0 "The Unions in our country still struggle to defend the rights of the workers in a national level. We shall expand their rights and responsibilities while also granting them greater autonomy, with the goal of facilitating their fight for the workers."
MEX_industrial_democracy:0 "Industrial Democracy"
MEX_industrial_democracy_desc:0 "Mexican society has revolved for many years around agricultural development and rural output. However, if we truly want to enter the modern age and apply the innovations our European brothers have made for socialism, we have to begin a transition towards an industrialized society."
MEX_agricultural_unions:0 "Agricultural Unions"
MEX_agricultural_unions_desc:0 "Now our reforms are in full swing. We should take advantage of our momentum and create an Agricultural Union, the 'Confederación Nacional Campesina' or 'CNC', so that even the rights of farmers are secured in our country."
MEX_empower_the_cgt:0 "Empower the CGT"
MEX_empower_the_cgt_desc:0 "The 'Confederación General de Trabajadores' has stood by Toledano and the 'Partido Mexicano de los Trabajadores' for a long time. We shall reward their loyalty by granting them official state support in order to help them win their fight against the CROM. Since the CROM stood with Calles and the Totalist, we only stand to gain from their victory."
MEX_modernist_culture:0 "Modernist Culture"
MEX_modernist_culture_desc:0 "In order for Mexico to embrace progress, it has to leave the once traditional roots it once had, and for that we need people to embrace new ideas. We shall try to bring Modernist culture into Mexico, with the goal of achieving, one day, more progressive traditions."
MEX_mexican_synidcalism:0 "Mexican Syndicalism"
MEX_mexican_synidcalism_desc:0 "While Syndicalism seems like a well-rounded system, it was designed in theory with Western European countries in mind, and it falls short in practice in certain aspects when considering countries outside that continent. However, we've found those flaws in the theory and we shall correct them into practice, creating our own version of syndicalism."

MEX_radical_socialist1:0 "Partido Nacional Agrarista"
MEX_radical_socialist1_desc:0 "The 'Agrarian National Party' has won the elections, with the legendary figure of Jose Doroteo Arango Arámbula, better known as Francisco 'Pancho' Villa, as its head. In his presidential speech, he claimed 'I, Pancho Villa, was a loyal man that destiny brought the world to fight for the good of the poor and that I will never betray nor forget my duty'. Now, it's our turn to make this oath a reality."
MEX_continue_land_reforms:0 "Continue Land Reform"
MEX_continue_land_reforms_desc:0 "Land Reform has been going on in full strength since Zapata was elected in 1932. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go, and as such we shall continue his efforts. As Zapata said 'The earth shall be returned to those who work it with their own hands'."
MEX_native_land_reform:0 "Native Land Reform"
MEX_native_land_reform_desc:0 "Natives were not necessarily included in the land reform efforts. We shall correct this technicality so that everyone in Mexico shall have a decent life!"
MEX_support_cgt:0 "Support the CGT"
MEX_support_cgt_desc:0 "While the 'Confederacion General de Trabajadores' stood mostly with the PMT, there are still plenty of supporters of our party in their ranks, and we trust them more than we trust the CROM, which has stood with Calles and his Totalists. Supporting them is the obvious choice and so we shall."
MEX_agrian_economy:0 "Agrarian Economy"
MEX_agrian_economy_desc:0 "Mexico for a long time has been a rural country. Straying from this old tradition might be risky, so we plan to stick to what has worked for us in the past and keep our agrarian economy, which has made us strong for many years."
MEX_rural_education:0 "Rural Education"
MEX_rural_education_desc:0 "Villa once claimed 'No one can do well that he does not know; therefore, there can never be a Republic with ignorant people, with whatever plan you might adopt'. Now that he's president, he has taken matters into his own hands and has proposed an ambitious funding plan for rural schooling. We shall support his proposition, to which he has also added 'I'd first pay a teacher than a general'."
MEX_empower_ejidos:0 "Empower Ejidos"
MEX_empower_ejidos_desc:0 "The Ejidos in Mexico has always been a revolutionary system and not only do we stand by them, we shall encourage their activities and expand their rights and responsibilities, along with some extra funding for their activities."
MEX_agricultural_modernization:0 "Agricultural Modernisation"
MEX_agricultural_modernization_desc:0 "While we have fully embraced being an agricultural nation, that doesn't mean we shall become technologically backwards. Many of our rural workers still have to work their fields with old equipment that just makes the task slower and harder. We shall help them by beginning a national program to grant them modernized equipment in order to make their jobs, and by extension, their lives easier."
MEX_feed_the_people:0 "Feed the People"
MEX_feed_the_people_desc:0 "The Mexican nation is not the richest in the world, and as such many of our citizens suffer food shortages in several rural towns. Villa will not forget his duty to these poor peasants and workers, and he shall begin a national program with the goal of providing everyone with basic food supplies, so that they never have to face hunger ever again."
MEX_agrian_socialism:0 "Agrarian Socialism"
MEX_agrian_socialism_desc:0 "Socialism since its inception has been a movement of the workers and the working class, which considered peasants as allies but not as equals.

MEX_empower_the_peasents:0 "Empower the Peasants"

MEX_social_democrat1_desc:0 "The 'Mexican Labour Party' has come out on top during the elections with Pascual Ortiz Rubio at the helm. Their promises of returning to De la Huerta and Obregon's moderate reforms have won over the populace. Now it shall be our turn to lead Mexico to a better future."

MEX_improve_native_rights_desc:0 "Natives in our country have not being treated with the utmost dignity ever since Mexico came to be a nation.

MEX_education_improvement:0 "Education Funding"

MEX_moderate_land_reform:0 "Moderate Land Reform"
MEX_moderate_land_reform_desc:0 "While many were happy with Zapata's land reform, he expropriated some land that belonged to small landowners who still lived within their lands and worked closely with their workers. We do not consider this a just move, yet we consider a land reform necessary. So, we shall continue the land reform efforts but assuring certain landowners the rights of keeping some of the land they now possess if they live and work there."
MEX_union_support:0 "Union Support"
MEX_union_support_desc:0 "Without the Union's support, most of our reforms would just be symbolical. We shall try to win over a bigger pool of supporters in both the CGT and the CROM, hopefully allowing us to further our reforms with their joint support."
MEX_industralization:0 "Industrialisation"
MEX_industralization_desc:0 "Mexico has been an agricultural nation for years, and as such we lag behind many other countries in the world in terms of prosperity.

MEX_social_welfare:0 "New Schools"
MEX_social_welfare_desc:0 "We have increased our education budget, but throwing money at the illiteracy problem is not going to solve it. Many rural towns in our country have the teachers but are forced to study in great houses or in the open. We stand to improve this as we shall begin funding the construction of new schools throughout Mexico."
MEX_mexican_socialism:0 "Mexican Socialism"
MEX_mexican_socialism_desc:0 "Mexican society is complex, there are plenty of both conservative and progressive towns and citizens that wish to help one another, but are both afraid that the other wants to oppress them. As such, we don't have the conventional 'Class struggle' that the socialists in Europe have. Provided this, we shall strive to create our own version of socialism, one that can adapt to the realities that the Mexican society faces."
MEX_strengthen_congress:0 "Strengthen Congress"

MEX_Reorganize_The_North:0 "Reorganise the North"
MEX_Reorganize_The_North_desc:0 "Much has changed in the Old North since we have left in 1848. People, cities, infrastructure, everything. However, reintegrating the North this will surely be no challenge for multicultural Mexico."
MEX_Hollywood:0 "The Hollywood Question"
MEX_Hollywood_desc:0 "The heart of the film industry of the gringos has now come under our control, and as part of our larger reorganisation of the old Norte, we have to decide what to do with it."
MEX_Alamo:0 "The Alamo Question"
MEX_Alamo_desc:0 "With Tejas the old Alamo has returned in our hands. For us, a symbol of humiliation and treason; for the Anglo-Texans, a symbol of freedom. The question still stands, however; do we leave it be, or do we take it down?"
MEX_Natives:0 "Status of the Natives"
MEX_Natives_desc:0 "The retaken territories do contain a lot of Native Americans, some of whom are resentful of being under yet another foreign country, some of whom are thankful we have liberated them. We, however, still aren't sure how to properly deal with them."
MEX_Women:0 "Status of Northern Women"
MEX_Women_desc:0 "Before the Reconquista, we probably would've described Gringo women as freer than us, but now that we have returned, we see that the situation is totally different. Vast reforms are needed to improve their status, but what exactly should be done?"
MEX_Religion:0 "Status of Northern Religion"
MEX_Religion_desc:0 "As with so many other Northern cultural elements that have come into question following the Reconquista, the Northern religion has now come to the forefront. And, as per the course, the question remains what to do with it. One wrong decision, and we might have given the gringos another reason to possibly take up arms against us."
MEX_Language:0 "Language Question"
MEX_Language_desc:0 "Mexico may be a multicultural nation, however the fact remains that the New Northerners speak in a language that is distant from our own, and as such are mostly free to conspire against us. Some hardliners claim we should introduce harsher sanctions on the English language, however critics claim it will turn them against us. What will we do?"
MEX_Secret_Police:0 "Establish Secret Police"
MEX_Secret_Police_desc:0 "In order to quell the Anglo Rebellion, the Intelligence Ministry has proposed the establishment of a secret police, to disrupt their activities and break up their cells. Such an agency will not only turn the rebellion's tide, but it will also give any other internal subverters pause."
MEX_Vigilantees:0 "Recruit Vigilantes"
MEX_Vigilantees_desc:0 "Perhaps the solution to end the Anglo Rebellion is not establishing a secret police after all. We have received an alternate proposal; namely, recruit pro-regime Hispanic Texans, Natives or just about anyone into vigilante gangs, in order to fight the rebels with their own weaponry."
MEX_End_The_Rebellion:0 "End the Rebellion"
MEX_End_The_Rebellion_desc:0 "We have taken the necessary measures, and the tide of the rebellion has been turned. It is time to end this uprising once and for all."

MEX_Reconquista:0 "Reconquista"
MEX_Reconquista_desc:0 "With America embroiled in a devastating civil war, perhaps the time has come to avenge the loss of the Northern Territories in the 1848 War. We will bleed the Federales dry and perhaps even contribute to the victory of Syndicalism in our northern neighbour."

MEX_army_modernization:0 "Modernize the Army"
MEX_army_modernization_desc:0 "The Mexican armed forces are still using outdated equipment from the Weltkrieg-era and our military doctrines and tactics have also fallen behind the times over the past decade. Our nation is a major player in North and Central America, so our army should be modernized and expanded."

MEX_guerilla_warfare:0 "Guerrilla Warfare"

MEX_zapatas_training:0 "Zapata's Legacy"
MEX_zapatas_training_desc:0 "It was thanks to Emiliano Zapata's excellent military tactics that we managed to defeat the counter-revolutionaries. His guerrilla tactics have successfully defeated the federalist forces, and we shall be able to repel any foreign invasion if we build up on his legacy."
MEX_night_ambushes:0 "Night Ambushes"
MEX_night_ambushes_desc:0 "One pillar for guerilla warfare is to not be seen before the attack commences. During the night, it will be easy to remain unspotted so our troops can come much closer to the enemy which will increase the effectivity of our ambushes."
MEX_citizen_soldier:0 "Citizen Soldiers"
MEX_citizen_soldier_desc:0 "A guerilla force should not only be made up of professional soldiers, but every citizen should also be able to participate in the fight against the enemy. With special citizen militias, we can make sure that every citizen will be able to fulfil his duties."
MEX_decentralized_command:0 "Decentralized Command"
MEX_decentralized_command_desc:0 "It is difficult to command a guerilla unit in the deserts of Sonora or the jungles of Yucatan from Mexico City. Our command structure should be more decentralized with local commanders having enough autonomy to perform well during guerilla attacks."
MEX_recon_scouts:0 "Recon Scouts"
MEX_recon_scouts_desc:0 "Ambushes can be very powerful, like the Afghans have shown in their constant wars against the British imperialists. However, an ambush is useless if no enemy ever arrives. Professional scouts which can accurately report the position of the enemy facilitate the setting up of ambushes."
MEX_small_unit_tactics:0 "Small Unit Tactics"
MEX_small_unit_tactics_desc:0 "Ambush units are usual on the same level of manpower as squads, maybe platoons, but an entire division doesn't create a good local ambush. Our army should function on the basis of small units, so our tactics and command structure need to be reworked."
MEX_die_standing:0 "Die Standing"
MEX_die_standing_desc:0 "Not a single meter of Mexican soil shall fall to the counter-revolutionaries and the imperialists! Our glorious soldiers shall defend every corner of Mexico, and they shall never yield! Mexico shall stay free, no matter the cost."

MEX_legacy_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "The Mexican Revolution was one of the largest military events in the recent history of our continent. Together with its sheer size, it has also brought new military tactics and weapons to Mexico. We should build up our army on the lessons learned from the war."

MEX_desert_training_desc:0 "One of our largest rivals on the American continent are the United States of America, which try to undermine Mexico's freedom.

MEX_jungle_training:0 "Jungle Training"
MEX_jungle_training_desc:0 "The revolution started out in the jungles of Southern Mexico, and the revolution shall be spread through the jungles of Central and Latin America. Our army should focus on adapting to this extremely hostile terrain, as it will form the battlefield of the future wars."
MEX_solderas:0 "Soldaderas"
MEX_solderas_desc:0 "During the Mexican Revolution, many women fought for the principles of the revolution. These 'soldaderas' have proven their strength and will on the battlefield, but women are still frowned upon in the military. We should end this discrimination and permit women to fight in our armed forces."
MEX_future_of_war:0 "Future of Warfare"
MEX_future_of_war_desc:0 "The future of warfare is dependent on the future of the equipment used. In order to prepared for the conflicts of tomorrow, which will undoubtedly challenge the integrity and freedom of Mexico, we will need to think today about the future of equipment."
MEX_industrial_warfare:0 "Industrial Warfare"
MEX_industrial_warfare_desc:0 "While the strength of our Mexican soldiers is high, the strength of a Mexican artillery piece is even higher. We need to equip our army with heavy infantry-support weapons to improve its fighting capabilities against a regular enemy force."
MEX_mechanized_warfare:0 "Mechanized Warfare"
MEX_mechanized_warfare_desc:0 "While the strength of our Mexican soldiers is high, and while the strength of a Mexican artillery piece is even higher, the strength of a Mexican tank is the highest! We need to mechanize our forces so that no regular enemy force can defeat us."

MEX_general_staff:0 "General Staff Reforms"
MEX_general_staff_desc:0 "The most effective fighting force is a professional, well regulated regular army. However, our armed forces are quite the opposite. We need to reform most aspects of our army, and we should start with the general staff and the command structure."
MEX_modern_division_structure:0 "Modern Division Structure"
MEX_modern_division_structure_desc:0 "A modern division has a complicated structure, meanwhile a Mexican division is just a few infantry battalions. We need to completely restructure the division template of the Mexican armed forces."
MEX_military_college:0 "New Military Colleges"
MEX_military_college_desc:0 "One major aspect what makes a professional army is a trained and large officer corps. Our army is short on experienced officers on all levels of the command struture, so we will need to expand our military colleges to train more officers."
MEX_professional_army:0 "Professional Army"
MEX_professional_army_desc:0 "The goal of our major military reforms is to create a professional, modern army. While we will achieve to create a modern army by improving our equipment and tactics, a professional army can only be achieved if every soldier knows his duties and is willing to fulfil them under any condition."
MEX_centralized_command:0 "Centralized Command"
MEX_centralized_command_desc:0 "If we give local commanders too much autonomy, our armed forces and HQ will drown in chaos once we meet the enemy as no one will know what exactly is happening. We need a regulated and centralized command structure to properly lead the army."
MEX_logistics:0 "Logistic Companies"
MEX_logistics_desc:0 "Due to our harsh terrain and underdeveloped infrastructure, it will be difficult to properly supply a large army with much heavy equipment. We need special units which oversee and organize the supply lines to keep our army always fully equipped."
MEX_flexiable_planning:0 "Flexible Planning"
MEX_flexiable_planning_desc:0 "Helmuth von Moltke the Elder accurately said that 'no battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy', and that has been perfectly proven by the chaotic battles of the Mexican Revolution.

MEX_grand_navy:0 "Grand Navy"
MEX_grand_navy_desc:0 "There are no jungles or mountains to hide in for the navy. While fighting with small, concealed units is a viable tactic for the ground forces, our naval forces will need to win naval engagements with large ships with even larger firepower."
MEX_naval_glory:0 "Naval Glory"
MEX_naval_glory_desc:0 "The sight of the Anáhuac is enough to impress most people and its 234mm guns are larger than any artillery pieces that our ground forces field. We should take pride in our naval forces which bravely defend the shores of Mexico."
MEX_battleships:0 "Battleship Development"
MEX_battleships_desc:0 "The Anáhuac is the largest ship of our navy, yet it is more than three decades old and will not be able to compete with modern capital ships. We need to develop our own proper battleship to serve as the new flagship of our navy."
MEX_battle_cruisers:0 "Battlecruiser Development"
MEX_battle_cruisers_desc:0 "Our naval industrial capacity is quite limited, so it will prove a difficult task to build up a force consisting of large battleships. We should accompany our larger capital ships with smaller but effective battlecruisers."
MEX_carriers:0 "Carrier Development"
MEX_carriers_desc:0 "A new ship type has emerged during the Weltkrieg, the carrier! Initially meant for sea planes, new large carriers have the capacity of a small airfield and can now support the naval forces with large, torpedo and bomb carrying, aircraft."
MEX_naval_aircraft:0 "Naval Aviation"
MEX_naval_aircraft_desc:0 "The air force has become a vital part of the military. While some doubt the effectivity of aircraft to perform precision strikes, most are convinced that they will play a major role in the future ground and naval battles. The navy has requested the formation of a naval aviation branch."

MEX_marines:0 "Fuerza de Infantería de Marina"
MEX_marines_desc:0 "Sometimes, it is easier to bypass the enemy forces by sea than to fight through entrenched lines in difficult terrain. While naval operations like the Battle of Gallipoli have failed, the invasion from the sea might become a viable military tactic."

MEX_protect_trade:0 "Protect Trade"
MEX_protect_trade_desc:0 "Our navy will simply never be able to compete with the major navies of the world, so instead of trying to compete nonetheless, we should focus on defending our trade lines instead. While we can't beat the US fleet, we can beat pirates and raiders."
MEX_coast_guard:0 "Coast Guard"
MEX_coast_guard_desc:0 "Our nation has a large coastline, both along the Pacific and the Caribbean Sea, which provides enough hiding places for raiders and smugglers. We need to patrol our coasts to stop these criminals."
MEX_destroyers:0 "Destroyer development"

MEX_heavy_cruisers:0 "Heavy Cruisers"
MEX_heavy_cruisers_desc:0 "Cruisers form the middle ground between battleships and destroyers. They are jack of all trades, but they still are subdivided into various classes. In case we ever need to engage a more regular fleet, we will need heavier cruisers to serve as 'mini-battleships'."
MEX_submarines:0 "Submarine Development"
MEX_submarines_desc:0 "We will need to protect our trade lines, but that doesn't stop us from raiding the trade lines of our enemies. Submarines are perfectly suited for convoy raiding missions, so we should invest more into the silent death from below the sea line."
MEX_light_cruisers:0 "Light Cruisers"
MEX_light_cruisers_desc:0 "A heavy cruiser is well suited for engaging as a regular fighting vessel, but most of our adversaries won't be fielding anything heavier than destroyers or similar ships. In order to save on resources, light cruisers are the way to go."

# Air Force #
MEX_air:0 "Fuerza Aérea Mexicana"
MEX_air_desc:0 "Our air force will not be able to compete with the British air force, but it will be perfectly suited for military operations in Central and Latin America. We should expand the Mexican air force as the aircraft will play an important role on the battlefield."
MEX_pilot_training:0 "Pilot Training"

MEX_air_ports:0 "Build Air Ports"
MEX_air_ports_desc:0 "An aircraft can't take off from a jungle... well we haven't tried yet but it seems unlikely. We need to construct airfields on flat terrain so that our air force can takeoff to defend the sky above Mexico."
MEX_air_defense:0 "Air Defence"
MEX_air_defense_desc:0 "We aren't the only ones to build up an air force... far from it actually. Our air force will most likely be on the defence if we have to face the major counter-revolutionary and imperalist airforces, so we should aid them from the ground."
MEX_air_supremecy:0 "Air Supremacy"

MEX_army_air_support:0 "Army Air Support"
MEX_army_air_support_desc:0 "Many of our adversaries, most notably counter-revolutionary Central American countries, lack an air force, so we should focus on supporting our army from the air. We will not be able to challenge the airforces of the Entente, so we should focus on exploiting the weakness of our smaller rivals."
MEX_bombers:0 "Bomber Research"
MEX_bombers_desc:0 "Using small aircraft armed with nothing more than machine guns to destroy enemy infrastructure and industry will be almost impossible. We need large aircraft with multiple engines to deliver a large bomb payload to the enemy."
MEX_radar:0 "RADAR Development"
MEX_radar_desc:0 "RADAR, which stands for radio detection and ranging, is a new method of detection which will be quite useful for the air force. With RADAR installations, we will be able to detect incoming aircraft outside of viewing distance so that we can alarm the air force quickly enough."
MEX_expand_air_ports:0 "Expand Air Ports"
MEX_expand_air_ports_desc:0 "Our air force is constantly expanding, but our airfields can't keep up. Their capacity limits will soon be exceeded, and we found out that you can't takeoff an aircraft from the jungle... we will need to expand our airfields quickly."
MEX_paratroopers:0 "Paratroopers"
MEX_paratroopers_desc:0 "The Battle of Gallipoli has shown that seaborne invasions are quite difficult to perform, but airborne invasions haven't been tried yet. We should build up an airborne unit that can jump behind enemy lines to cut supply lines and ambush retreating forces."
MEX_rule_the_skies:0 "Rule the Skies"
MEX_rule_the_skies_desc:0 "The Mexican air force shall rule the skies... well the skies of Central America at least. It will still take quite a while until we can compete with the airforces of the Entente..."




### Events - start up ###

mexico.1.t:0 "The Golden Eagle of the South"
mexico.1.d:0 "Mexico’s history is long, rich, and exceedingly diverse, but has been plagued by one main invariable and nearly unending reality - War. Whether it be against America in 1845 or against itself in 1857, Mexico’s history has been defined by rival thinkers and ambitious idealogues launching war after war and revolt after revolt in fleeting attempts at imposing their own form of government on the rest of the country. This atmosphere of unabated conflict momentarily ended with the rise of Porfirio Díaz, who secured power by appeasing both Conservatives and Liberals across the nation, leading Mexico through an age of unparalleled modernization and advancement, but also an age of inequality and intense social strife. \n\nLike all dictators though, he wasn’t eternal and was deposed in 1911 in a mostly bloodless revolution, but his followers didn’t stay idle, and they would attempt to restore the old dictatorship, with Victoriano Huerta leading a counter-coup in 1913. This move threw the country into the throes of a real civil war, and thus the Mexican Revolution fully began. \n\nAmid the chaos and ever-shifting web of deals and alliances, three main sides coalesced: the populist alliance of Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata, the constitutionalist clique of Venustiano Carranza and Álvaro Obregón, and finally the “Porfirist” camp led by Victoriano Huerta and Manuel Mondragón."
mexico.1.a:0 "Then what happened?"

mexico.1200.t:0 "A New Year Dawns for the Southern Eagle"
mexico.1200.d:0 "After years of intense fighting, Victoriano Huerta and his alliance were defeated in 1915, even though peace seemed impossible for a moment as the American intervention and their landing in Veracruz led to a short ceasefire between most factions to kick the Yankees out. With Huerta deposed, a conference was called by the Populists, who invited the Constitutionalists to form a new United Government. Despite their overtures however, Venustiano Carranza would reject the offer. Soon after, Álvaro Obregon defected from Carranza’s clique when he was shown possibly-falsified evidence by an officer that Carranza planned to have him assassinated. After this defection, Carranza was left with virtually no allies, and was swiftly defeated by 1916. However, President Woodrow Wilson of the United States, deciding that Carranza was better than the “Socialists” in the Populist army, sent weapons and troops to Carranza’s stronghold in Veracruz while also making small expeditions into the nation through the border. This new gringo intervention led to tensions and even more defections within Carranza’s camp as information about this deal began to leak to the wider public. Finally, in 1920, Pablo González Garza assassinated Carranza and defected to the camp of the now elected President Álvaro Obregón, finally ending the Mexican Revolution. \n\nThankfully, Obregon was able to form a United government by supporting Pancho Villa’s governorship of Chihuahua and by appointing Emiliano Zapata as Secretary of Agriculture, and after two successive presidents since the revolution hailing from Obregon’s PLM (those being Francisco R. Serrano and Luis N. Morones), Zapata and his PNA were elected in 1932. \n\nWhile he is broadly popular, Zapata’s election also led to the creation of the Anti-Socialist Alliance and the Liga Demócrata, with both groups violently opposing his somewhat radical, Socialist views. With Zapata’s fourth year in office just beginning and with tensions rising across the nation, Mexico sits on a razor’s edge once more. Whether it will finally break the cycle of unending strife and warfare, or if it succumbs to its seemingly inescapable destiny once again is another question."

With the Socialists down but not out, many of those close to Garza have advised the honored general to side with one of two main factions combating Socialist influence within the country. They are the Anti-Socialist Alliance - a loose coalition of Synarchists, Integralists, Corporatists, and other far-right groups banded together with their shared hatred of Socialism despite their diverse array of members - and the Democratic League - a diverse camp of various non-Socialist democratic and republican elements that have resisted the Red Tide since the Revolution began. Allying with either group would certainly beholden us to some of their views and ideas, but both have proven their effectiveness in combating the Socialist menace, so some compromise might still be worth their talents. However, despite their ferocity and usefulness, there have been rumors that should we cooperate with these groups, some of the more zealous amongst them may attempt their own seizure of power. Alternatively, Garza could also simply deny the aid of these radicals and republicans, and instead blaze his own trail for Mexico to follow all on his own. Whatever his choice may be, Mexico’s destiny lies in his hands regardless."

mexico.44.d:0 "The ASA have proven true to their word, and our cooperation has proven to be quite fruitful. Our combined forces have racked up quite a number of victories against the vile Socialist traitors and rebels. Of course, some within the Junta and the wider coalition are growing concerned at the fact that the Sinarquistas are getting the credit and growing in popularity, which has begun to take its toll on the coalition’s stability and cohesion. The largest group of these detractors are within the Garza’s cabinet and in ARM, or Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista. More commonly known as the Camisas Doradas, or ‘Gold Shirts’, the ARM is a reactionary paramilitary-turned-political party headed by Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco with close ties to Garza himself. With the Synarchists rising in popularity and with the ARM growing more discontent with the nature of the ASA, many fear that our coalition is not to be long lived. However, even with these worries in the back of our minds, for now we can claim victory against the rebels and celebrate."
mexico.44.a:0 "Viva Mexico!"

mexico.45.t:0 "The Gold Shirts March on Mexico City"
mexico.45.d:0 "With the Sinarquistas only growing in popularity, the gurgling cauldron of caustic ambition and bitter rivalries brewing within the ASA has at last boiled over, and the once-shakey coalition has finally imploded. With ARM raging against the current political machine and with General Garza pledging his support for their cause, the Synarchists of UNS and Integralists of PIN have banded together in order to resist their new foes. \n\nEven now, more Gold Shirts pour into Mexico City by the hundreds, seeking to topple the ASA regime and establish singular rule under ARM led by Garza and Carrasco. With local police forces and national guard being overwhelmed, and with treachery within the ranks of the main army now all too common, it would seem that ARM has a solid chance at seizing the city. \n\nShould ARM take the capitol, then soon all of Mexico will too fall to the ambitions of Garza and Carrasco. However, if the tide can be turned then Urquiza’s Sinarquistas and Vasconcelos’ Integralistas may just be able to save Mexico from the Gold Shirts."

Mexico City is now secure, and with this military crisis now averted, a new political one rises to take its place. \n\nWith the ASA in ruins as effectively one-third of its power now being purged due to their rebellion and its aftermath, the ASA stands at a crossroads. The two main camps left within the clique are the Integralists of PIN - Partido Integralista Nacional - led by José Vasconcelos Calderón and Salvador Abascal, and the Synarchists of UNS - Unión Nacional Sinarquista - led by José Antonio Urquiza, and they compete for influence daily. The Sinarquistas are devoutly Catholic, viscously anti-democratic, and rabidly nationalistic, favoring national syndicalist, populist, and mixed economics, while the Integralistas are Catholics as well, and largely, but not exclusively, monarchists pushing for a decentralized, ‘organic’ Mexico similar to the Spanish and Portuguese Integralist movements. Either of these two factions must now rise to take center stage, and either offer their vision to Mexico unaltered or take notes from their stalwart allies. Regardless, Mexico once again stands at a crossroads under the mercy of a few select strongmen."
mexico.450.a:0 "Urquiza’s Unión Nacional Sinarquista will guide the nation."

mexico.4501.t:0 "A Herald for the Integralist Regime"
mexico.4501.d:0 "The Partido Integralista Nacional has risen to become the dominant faction within the ASA in the wake of ARM’s failed coup. With the Synarchists forced to play second fiddle to our interests, the Integralistas now dominate Mexico’s government. All that is left now is to choose who shall lead the party into this new future. For years, José Vasconcelos Calderón has led PIN without fail, and thanks to his leadership, an Integralist Mexico has been born. However, some have come to doubt this aging hero’s ability to command the nation in this turbulent time, for the current world stage requires each nation to have an almost mercurial flexibility and adaptability to survive - something this old dog set in his ways may not be capable of. Wanting to push Vasconcelos into an early, but still respected, retirement, this clique of doubters has found a possible replacement in Vasconcelos’ protege Salvador Abascal, whose name has been floated as a suitable heir to Vasconcelos’ vision. Regardless, PIN is destined to guide Mexico into its new Integralist future regardless - now we only have to choose a face to rally behind in this new regime."
mexico.4501.a:0 "The founder of our movement José Vasconcelos Calderón shall lead us."
mexico.4501.b:0 "Vasconcelos’ right-hand man Salvador Abascal rises to lead PIN."

mexico.4502.t:0 "A Strongman for ARM’s Mexico"
mexico.4502.d:0 "Following their successful coup, Generals Roque González Garza and Nicolás Carrasco now stand as the two most powerful men in Mexico, and with Mexico City in their palms, all the nation now must surely bend to their will. However, despite their cooperation and aligning goals, only one of these strongmen can rise to become Mexico’s sole executive, and with each effectively controlling half of the Gold Shirts respectively, this is no small decision. \n\nGeneral Garza shielded the nation in the wake of Zapata’s assassination, and has steadfastly served Mexico in its crusade to rid itself of Socialist taint. Following more mainline corporatist, nationalist, and other contemporary third position principles, Garza is seen as the moderate within ARM to many. On the other hand, Nicolás Carrasco is the far more radical of the two, being even more nationalist and ardently anti-Christian while espousing revivalist ideas about Mexico’s pre-colonial past. Only one of these men can continue to blaze the trail that the Gold Shirts and now all of Mexico follows, and so a choice must be made."
mexico.4502.a:0 "Garza has served us admirably, and will continue to do so."
mexico.4502.b:0 "The radical Nicolás Carrasco wildly seizes the reins of power."

mexico.360.t:0 "Dynasties Old and New"
mexico.360.d:0 "After much debate, our government has decided to restore the long-dead Mexican monarchy - a system not seen since 1867 - and now our administration must decide on which dynasty shall be chosen to ascend to the restored throne. Before us lies three main candidates worthy of the Crown. Firstly and most notably, we could invite Doña María Anna Tunkl-Iturbide, of the House of Habsburg-Itúrbide. Given her illustrious heritage, she is quite famously the granddaughter of Salvador de Itúrbide (himself grandson of our first emperor Agustín and an adopted son of our second monarch Maximilian I). Doña María would be most appreciated by the traditional Catholics and conservative politicians within our government, and would put us on good relations with the various European powers still beholden to monarchical formalities. Alternatively, a 'nativist' clique has emerged, supporting the claims of Don Fernando de Teruel - current holder of the Spanish title of Duke of Moctezuma de Tultengo - a true blood descendent of the last Aztec emperor Moctezuma II. Finally, a third clique has arisen that harkens back to the Porfiriato - the era of Porfirio Díaz’s rule - and as such have risen Porfirio Diaz Jr - nicknamed ‘Porfirito’ by his late father - as a candidate representing a new and purely Mexican line. Whomever is chosen by our regime shall soon be crowned as the newest monarch of Mexico, taking the throne and our shared destiny as their sole burdens."
mexico.360.a:0 "Support the claims of Doña María Anna de Habsburgo-Itúrbide"
mexico.360.b:0 "Choose Don Fernando, the Duke of Moctezuma"
mexico.360.c:0 "Choose Porfirio Diaz Jr., the heir of the Porfiriato"

mexico.361.t:0 "The Fate of Our Leadership"
mexico.361.d:0 "As General Garza consolidates his grip on the nation, a final decision about the nature of his regime must be made. Through deft maneuvering and through martial might, Garza and his allies have come to rule over all of Mexico, but have done so through a military junta thinly veiled as a temporary government. Though potentially more stable, and allowing Garza a more open and free hand when governing, this junta has created many enemies for this anti-Socialist crusader. To alleviate these tensions and to legitimize Garza’s rule moreso, many moderates and civilian leaders close to him have suggested that he allow the creation of a new civilian government to rule Mexico in his place. Forming around the Partido Revolucionario de Unificación Nacional, or PRUN, this regime would still fully be beholden to the whims and will of Garza, but would do so behind a thick facade or shackled republicanism and false democracy. Alternatively, General Garza could instead rule with an iron fist, continuing the junta and consolidating it into a full stratocratic regime. Regardless, only Garza now controlled the destiny of Mexico and its people, and now it was up to Garza once again to determine the direction of the nation."
mexico.361.a:0 "Only total military rule can save Mexico now!"
mexico.361.b:0 "Allow a shackled civilian government to form behind PRUN."

mexico.46.t:0 "Garza's Speech"
mexico.46.d:0 "As the sweltering sun began to peek over the caps of the Sierra Madre in the distance and as the lively streets of Mexico City stirred and woke on this cool morning, the heart of the capitol was electrified to life as General Roque González Garza began his long-awaited speech. Standing atop the front steps of the Palacio Nacional, Garza looked out at the crowd filling the Plaza del Zócalo - the main square of Mexico City continuously in use since the time of the Aztec and Mexica - and began to exclaim his future plans for the nation to the wider public. As a new sun of a new day dawned over the capitol, Garza exclaimed that a new dawn was rising for all of Mexico as a whole, heralding a new age for our war-torn yet stalwart state, and met with cheers and chants of support from the growing mass of citizens that stood before him. \n\nHowever, not all in the crowd were so ecstatic over Garza’s energizing rhetoric, for the crowd concealed a dark plot that was about to unfold. As Garza continued to gesticulate and posture, an armed and masked agent slowly made his way to the front of the crowd, and with Garza’s retinue of bodyguards all distracted and enthralled by Garza’s magnetic words, the hooded figure was able to get uncomfortably close to Garza’s lectern. With Garza reaching the climax of his prepared speech, the crowd was whipped up into a frenzy, and in that rising moment of celebration, hope, and the lively energy of life, a thundering shot rang out, immediately killing any jubilation and replacing it with sheer terror. Drawing first silence then screaming horror from the crowd, the assassin’s work was done, and as Garza collapsed, the masked figure fled as some of Garza’s guards followed in pursuit. With attendants rushing to Garza’s aid and with many already fearing the worst, the future of Mexico has once again been gambled away on an assassin’s bullet."
mexico.46.a:0 "The round struck an artery, and Garza bled out on the stage."
mexico.46.b:0 "The round misses anything vital, and Garza is expected to pull through."

mexico.460.t:0 "Replacing Our National Father"
mexico.460.d:0 "General and national savior Roque González Garza has been shot dead during his long-awaited address to the nation, and now all of Mexico recoils in horror we are once again cast into the fires of the unknown. With Garza’s tragic death at the hand of this murderer, the reins of power have once again been left idle after yet another assassin leaves their mark on our history. In the wake of this chaotic turn of events, a new successor must be quickly chosen to take Garza’s place, for Mexico needs a strongman to guide it now more than ever! \n\nBefore our administration lies two possible heirs to Garza’s position: Felix Díaz and Juan Barragán - both proven loyalists to Garza during his life, and now dedicated heralds for the late hero’s vision. Felix Díaz is more ‘old-school’, following the ideals of the infamous Porfirio Díaz and the Porfiriato as a champion of liberal-conservative authoritarianism. Opposing him, Juan Barragán is far more of a populist authoritarian, and notably is a direct descendent to the House of Moctezuma. Regardless, of who is chosen, allies of Garza can have some peace of mind, for both Díaz and Barragán pay great lip-service to the late hero of Mexico, and both are expected to largely follow Garza’s plans for the nation, with their own small flair added to the mix. Now all that is left to do is choose who shall replace our fallen leader."
mexico.460.a:0 "Felix Díaz shall take Garza’s place and lead Mexico."
mexico.460.b:0 "Juan Barragán will steer the nation in Garza’s stead."

mexico.61.d:0 "In Mexico City today a new constitution was unveiled today. The Constitution of [GetYear] is rather similar to the 1917 Constitution, though it is also different in a number of ways. Notably it does not contain the same anti-clericalism, land reform and other radical parts that made up the 1917 constitution. It is regarded as a more moderate, more democratic constitution. While there is great fanfare in Mexico City, in a number of rural towns the new constitution was met with obvious disdain."

mexico.100.d:0 "Synarchism as an ideology is still in it's infancy, with the main unifying factor being a resistance to liberalism and secularism. Under the Synarchist banner there exist both Legionarists following the pattern of the Iron Guard, and the other followers of La Raza. The inherent conflict between these forces concerns their racial policies. The Synarchist leadership under Salvador Abascal sees the traditional caste system of Mexico as the correct social order, including the enshrinement of Catholic priests. La Raza as promoted by José Vasconcelos proports the idea of a Hispanic race as the true ideal of Mexican patriotism. These ideas are more similar to Integralism in Brazil than Legionarism. The party has begun to split with La Raza members becoming disillusioned with the lack of support they receive within the party. How can we correct this?"

The organisation is to help train the youth the ideals of Sinarchismo and traditional catholic values. Structurally the organisation is similar to scouting groups that exist in other countries though controlled by the Mexican government. The Juventudes Sinarquistas has two main sub-organisations, one for boys and one for girls.

The Conference in Mexico City, originally organized by the Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista, was conceived as a means to end the rivalry between Mexico's Nationalist political strata, such an end was mediated by the paramilitary militia of the Camisas Doradas, The Gold Shirts, who proceeded to storm the building with automatic weapons, killing anyone and everyone in sight. The Synarchists, The Integralists, Republicans, even the old Royal Family, theselves personally invited by the Integralists to attend, none were spared from the cruelty of the Gold Shirt's assault as they gunned down every attendee of the conference and anyone else they perceived as a potential enemy of the state. In the wake of this atrocity, the current administration has been placed under the control of a temporal council lead by the Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista, assuming full control of the apparatus of state under a new, ultra-nationalist government, one hellbent on swiftly and permanently eliminating all threats to the new revolutionary state in Mexico, both within and without."

As the death tolls rises and the fires rage across Mexico's inner cities, it is clear that the Gold Shirt's anti-clerical crusade is only just beginning, with the only real exception to to these recent pogroms being the numerous catholic missions that dot the countryside, which have been largely ignored due to their relative isolation from Mexican society, and have thus been mostly spared from the brutality of the Gold Shirt's onslaught."

And it is not only the desert that has become a haven for fugitives fleeing the Gold Shirt's purges; the deep jungles of southern Mexico, once the ancestral heartland of the Aztecs, has also seen an increase traffic as refuges and partisans alike have begun shielding themselves beneath the vast jungle canopy west of the border to Guatemala.

Himself the nephew of the late, great General Porfirio Diaz, a hero of the revolutionary war against Emperor Maximilian, and later, the President of the newly founded Republic of Mexico, it is little wonder that a man like Felix Diaz, like many other generals with a family history of military service, would perhaps become prideful with such a prestigious lineage, his own cousin, also named Porfirio Diaz, is similarly proud of his family's service to the Mexican people, and is also said to have voiced his own reservations about the ARM regime in private. This supposed insolence has sparked some outrage among the general officer corps most loyal to the cause of the Gold Shirts, the most vocal among them being Field Marshall Saturnino Cedillo, a long time rival of both the Generals Diaz, decrying their alleged disloyalty as tantamount to treason."

While the exact nature of the Cult and it's leadership remains unknown, the implication of treason on the part of the Generals Felix and Porfirio Diaz in aiding the assassins in Colonia Doctores clearly points to a conspiracy within the counter revolutionary army. On the order of the Temporal Council, General Cedillo has set out with a contingent of the Gold Shirt's Militiamen with the goal of arresting and interrogating the Cousins Diaz to uncover the full extent of the Santa Muerte Plot."

But the name that most know her by is that of Mexico's patron saint of death; the Lady of Shadows, Santa Muerte. Once upon a time, she had been little more than an urban legend revered by the Banditos on the run in the desolateness of Mexico's northern deserts, and to hear her name invoked now serves little more than as a means to frighten young children with fantastical tales by the campfire of Mexico's own grim reaper. However, with the situation in the country so desperate, and so many fleeing the chaos wrought by the Gold Shirt's regime into the wilderness of the hinterlands, known to many as the hallowed grounds of Santa Muerte and her faithful, few in number though they may be, our scouts are reporting that many, both among refuges and partisan alike, have taken to seeking solace in bosom of Mexico's Goddess of Death. It is clear that the long term psychological damage of the ARM's terror tactics are having an effect on Mexico's oppressed population if so many have resorted to adhering to the dogma of otherwise obscure folklore, and although the Temporal Council has scarcely addressed the slow rise in popularity of the worship of Santa Muerte in the hinterlands, believing it to be little more than frightful superstition, many among the soldiery are growing restless at the notion that Santa Muerte and her followers might pose far more real of a threat than anyone realizes."

mexico.149.d:0 "The continuing issues the Temporal Council face in consolidating power in Mexico has encountered a major set back; recent council meetings in Mexico City have been stymied by an increasing ideological conflict between the principle members of the ARM's leadership; the root of this inter-party schism stems from the minds of the revolutionary general Roque González Garza and the paramilitary militia leader Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco, with the former having come to represent the so-called "Old Guard" among the ARM. and the latter representing a cabal called the "New Guard". This rivalry within the ARM seams to be a manifestation of a long-running series of disagreements between Garza and Carrasco regarding the cultural and societal future of the Mexican people; Carrasco and his New Guard have spoken candidly of creating a latin-american utopia, culminating in a complete cultural revolution that would serve as a resurrection of the ancient traditions of the Aztecs, even going so far as to reconstitute the Aztec Religion, including many of its archaic and almost barbaric customs, as Mexico's official state religion. Carrasco's apparent vision of Mexico reincarnated as the mythic Aztlán has disturbed a number of those among both the Temporal Council and the ARM as a whole, and many of them have flocked to the side of General Garza and the Old Guard, with Garza himself echoing their concerns as to the validity, or indeed, the sanity of Carrasco, his supporters and their ambitions, instead insisting on maintaining the party line and secular doctrine of the revolution, urging his cohorts not to indulge in delusional fantasy and dogma. It is clear in the arguments between Garza and Carrasco that the ARM is far more dysfunctional than it appears, and with the regime's recent problems in pacifying the countryside, the ARM may find itself vulnerable to yet another counter-revolution."

mexico.150.d:0 "Continuous efforts by the administration of the Gold Shirts to suppress and persecute the remnants of their political enemies have highlighted a crucial flaw in the ARM's powerbase; since assuming control of the country, almost the entirety of he ARM's political power is centered in the urban elite of Mexico's metropolitan cities, with the municipal apparatus of Mexico City itself firmly under the control of the Temporal Council and it's allies. The problem encountered by both the Gold Shirt Militia and the military all keep coming back to the ineffectiveness the regime has had in extending their influence beyond the metropolitan center of the country into the mountains, jungles and deserts that surround them; Mexico itself has always been known as rural country to the rest of the world, and with the nation being relatively under-industrialized compared to the United States combined with the intense lack of modern roads or rail-lines, this means that any large scale attempt exert their influence to the north or south suddenly becomes an immensely problematic endeavor as communications break down and logistics becomes bogged down by Mexico's historically difficult terrain features. Indeed, these issues plaguing the Temporal Council's efforts of consolidation are beginning to mirror the multiplicative issues that the Ottoman Empire has had over the last several decades in reaffirming control over their subject peoples; More and more, the hinterlands to the north and south are rapidly becoming a cauldron of instability,  symbolic of all of the ARM's problems in solidifying their rule from Mexico City, both the military and the militia's failures to bring the countryside to heel are beginning to reflect poorly on the legitimacy of the government, and already, reports of corruption emanating from the military's outposts in both the north and south are beginning to circulate."

But there is another phenomenon has begun to manifest out on the fringes of Mexican backwater; Santa Muerte, the latin deity of death long since driven underground by the likes of Syndicalists and Republicans alike, has seen a resurgence among the refuges and dissidents in the badlands in a manner that is unprecedented, but perhaps not without reason; with the desolation of Mexican people targeted by the tyranny of the Temporal Council, and with such cruel and merciless destruction done against the latin way of life and tradition, many left stranded in the wilderness and hiding from the Gold Shirts are utterly without hope, nevermind faith, from having had their entire livelihoods decimated by the ARM's ruthless reign, in such tragic circumstances, it is of little wonder that faithful of Mexico, having seen both their faith and their families all but wiped out, would than seek answers, comfort, or perhaps even the promise of revenge, in the grim dogma and dark promises of the Mexico's enigmatic Doña Bella Sebastiana. It is not just the refuges that have gradually come under of the followers of Santa Muerte; many among the deserted soldiery and dissenting soldadera have taken to venerating Santa Muerte and a growing number of brothers and sisters among the clergy and the nunnery have taken to incorporating Santa Muerte and her teachings into their sermons, this strange mixing of the faiths of Mexico's downtrodden is slowly growing in popularity."

Such ambitions carry a heavy price for the people of Mexico, and from their suffering, a new and shadowy organization has come to the fore and from the depths of the jungles and beneath the hills of the great deserts, these proud and fanatical followers of Santa Muerte have proclaimed themselves to be the true protectors of Mexico; zealous, capable, cunning and utterly devoid fear, they are nuns, priests, doctors, farmers, miners, soldiers, soldadera, men, women, children and all, risen from the ashes, uplifted from carnage wrought by the brutality of the ARM, all willing and ready to lay down their lives in the name of God, Jesus Christ and the promose of vengeance against the plague bacilli of Roche and Carrasco, and all in the name of the enigmatic La Dama Poderosa, a name given to Santa Muerte, but also one given to the apparent leader and prophet of this new latin faith. Some in the badlands call them Los Iluminados, "The Illuminated Ones,", others compare their strange and ominous beliefs to the old heresies of medieval, calling them "Cathars" for their intense devotion and the inclusion woman priestesses among their faithful, many others, however, simply know them as the Cult of Santa Muerte, and with the ARM regime so exposed with the recent troubles internally, many in Mexico City anxiously lie in wait, staring out from behind the cracked adobe walls of their haciendas, watching the trees and hills beyond for this new, looming threat"

While some among the Council grumble at being reminded of their failings in curtailing the dissenters in the countryside, no can deny the damage dealt against the ARM's reputation in the recent months, and while some among the officer corps still question the validity of Diaz's overtures, with Field Marshal Cedillo, a bitter rival of Diaz and his cousin, openly questioning the motives behind Diaz's sudden change of heart. None the less, the recent troubles in the countryside means that a public display of power and solidarity is needed, the question that follows, naturally, is to whom the responsibility of speaking to the Mexican people falls?

mexico.161.d:0 "Dawn breaks over the fires of Veracruz as the army under Saturnino Cedillo musters for the attack, and while many are resolute in their loyalty to their commander and to Mexico, the broadcast from the seemingly resurrected Maria Gizela seems to have unnerved many among the soldiery, not the least reason being the riots in the city, frightful with the idea that the superstitious nonsense by the would-be monarch might somehow be true. The Temporal Council remains unimpressed; having shone little sympathy and less concern for the threat of Santa Muerte or their traitorous allies in the army; the uprising in Veracrus is their more pressing, immediate concern. The present strategy placed forward to Cedillo and the General Staff is a decisive and swift put down of the malcontents downtown; a direct march into the city, forcing the surrender and quelling of the mod and dealing out harsh punishment to those who resist; the Council is adamant that, at this stage, violent reconciliation in the face of the rebel threat is of upmost importance for the preservation of the Mexican State, no matter what the usurpatious rabble might think. Field Marshal Cedillo is not so convinced of this notion; the stern-faced Chief of the Army is of the belief that Santa Muerte has set a trap for the army amidst the chaos in the streets and believe that a more methodical, meticulous encirclement of Veracruz to be the best method of dealing with the uprising, they are convinced that Santa Muerte are responsible for inciting the commonfolk to riot, and thusly, likely have agents within Veracruz and that a through sweep of city, avoiding the main areas of unrest in favor of a search, street by street, house by house, room by room, is what should take precedence in order to uncover any agent of the rebellion."
mexico.161.a:0 "We can't trust the general staff after Diaz, order the army to march on the city!"
mexico.161.b:0 "Veracruz is already lost, allow General Cedillo to conduct a counter-insurgency."

mexico.162.t:0 "Cedillo's brutality against Santa Muerte proves successful"
mexico.162.d:0 "As the fires continued to rage in the city, an equally infernal campaign took place in the shadows of Veracruz as the rioting reached a fever pitch; the army kept a watch over the barricades and checkpoints leading in and out of the city while armed members of the Gold Shirts conducted their search of the city, looking for any signs of corruption, block by block as the army gradually moved inward on the city, arresting and executing rioters that crossed their path. While the Field Marshal's plan was meant to be a less aggressive and dangerous answer to a direct assault on the city, the army chief's plan of slow encirclement is far from a passive response; suppression tactics against dissenters has been harsh and uncompromising with anyone suspected of involvement with Santa Muerte, legitimately or otherwise, were executed, often including even the families of those suspected of involvement with Cult to be placed in front of a firing squad. As cruel and uncompromising as the advance into Veracruz was, the results of Cedillo's advance proved successful; numerous individuals identified as acolytes and priestesses of Santa Muerte, were discovered collaborating with agitators in the mob, supplying them with rudimentary weapons and bombs and organizing the rioters to strike targets of interest in the city. With the resistance cells in the city pacified, the moral of the rioters was sapped as the army slowly closed in on the city center, and by day's end, the army of General Cedillo marched into the Plaza of the city center, the remnants of the rioters ether dispersed or dead on the ground as the army reestablished control over Veracruz, the city itself having suffered major damage as a result of the fighting."
mexico.162.a:0 "The city can be rebuilt, we must stop Santa Muerte at all costs!"

mexico.163.t:0 "The Inferno"
mexico.163.d:0 "As the dawn rose above Veracruz, the sounds of ironclad footfalls echoed across the desert as the army of Saturnino Cedillo marched over the causeway into the city to pacify the ongoing unrest in the city and restore order in the name of the sovereignty of the Mexican state. What awaited them was something far more sinister than they could have imagined, far beyond mere matters of state and sovereign, and would descend on them like the wrath of god. Under the scorching heat of the morning sun, the army marched into the city center, where bulk of the mob simmered in the pale orange light of the burning buildings that surrounded them as the army rode up to meet them; the rabble glared at General Cedillo with barely contained hatred as he ordered the crowd to disperse and return to their home, quietly and orderly. The noise that greeted the Field Marshal's dictum was nothing human; a thunderous, ear-splitting roar as the mob rose up to charge at the lines and lines riflemen before them, their number seeming to spawn out of the ether; they came out of alleyways, out of the sewers like rabies-ridden rats. What ensued was a carnage unlike any Mexico has ever seen; Cedillo's rifles cracked at the oncoming mob, killing dozens in the first volley, and still, the people came on, armed with little more than improvised melee weapons for the most part as their numbers continued overran Cedillo's men. The fanaticism displayed by the rioters was no less terrifying; scores of unarmed men charged at soldiers armed with rifle and bayonet only to be cut down without the slightest concern for their own mortality, woman wrapped their arms around soldiers and held them in place as their comrades immolated them both with firebombs fill with kerosene, and at the height of the attack, an elderly man drove a truck filled with dynamite right into a contingent of soldiers moments before a molotov cocktail utterly obliterated the whole lot of them. Stunned by the casualties and scale of the resistance, Field Marshal Cedillo has ordered a full retreat."

mexico.164.t:0 "Fernando Tultengo announces support for Maria III, Indigenous Mexicans to join in rebellion?"
mexico.164.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to combat Santa Muerte's influence in Veracruz, it would seem yet another prominent figure has been bewitched by their pretender queen and waltzed right into the hands of our enemy, worse still, yet another who holds much say over the hearts of the people of Mexico. Fernando Tultengo, Lord of the House of Moctezuma, direct descendant of Montezuma and the pretender to the Empire of the Aztecs, has announced his support for Maria III and her disciples via radio broadcast, urging the Native Peoples of Mexico to take up arms against the ARM. When the Gold Shirt's rose to power amidst the coup in Mexico City, Don Fernando was among those invited to the conference in the Capital, but due to a particularly serendipitous case of the flu, he elected to remain at his mansion deep in the heart of the Yucatan, thus sparing him from the massacre tha claimed the lives of the rest of Mexico's royalty. In the months that passed since the ARM's rise to power, and with the ARM's persistent inability to properly assert authority over the countryside, there has existed an uneasy, unspoken arrangement between the ARM and Tultengo up to now; the counter revolutionary army and the Gold Shirt militias would spare the indigenous Mexican communities from the majority of political violence that has swept the nation thus far, and Tultengo, himself a prominent and influential figure to both native mexicans and latinos, would ensure that neither he nor the indigenous population would speak out against, or interfere in, the affairs of ether the ARM or the army."
mexico.164.a:0 "Coño!"

mexico.165.t:0 "Fernando Tultengo announces support for Maria III, Indigenous Mexicans to join in rebellion?"
mexico.165.d:0 "This new alliance with Santa Muerte, originally thought to be a mere guerilla force, now poses a significant threat to the Mexico; unlike the United States and Canada, the native peoples of both Mexico and Central America making up as much as 13% of the population, with the combined numbers of people, especially the large populations of Nahua and Yucatec Maya, numbering at over 12 million people, with the majority of said population residing in the jungles of southern Mexico south of Mexico City. If such estimates are to be believed, and Tultengo's influence to be accounted for, the prospects of a native revolt in Mexico are very grim indeed, and with the fires of Veracruz still fresh in everyone's mind, the Temporal Council, fearing that their southern flank has been compromised, has ordered a full withdrawal from southern Mexico, ordering General Cedillo to reinforce at his stronghold at San Luis Potosi to prepare for a potential strike against the Yucatan while the Gold Shirt's militias work to consolidate and fortify Mexico City in the event another uprising."
mexico.165.a:0 "Cortés was far too kind to them!"

mexico.166.t:0 "The Seige of San Luis"
mexico.166.d:0 "With the army still sore from the fighting in Veracruz, Army Chief Cedillo, following orders from the Temporal Council, arrived in San Luis to reinforce and consolidate against the city against the rebel threat, already seemingly bolstered by their faith in the Santa Muerte Cult and further radicalized by the royalist agitators of Maria III and Fernando Tultengo, the later of whom having recently called upon the native population in Mexico to rise in revolt. General Cedillo, meanwhile, seems to have been taken aback by the zealotry and cunning displayed by the Santa Muerte Cult and their allies, so much so that he has begun to eye the civilian population in San Luis with suspicion, paranoid that if the cult could influence the people of Veracruz so corrosively, can the same thing happen in San Luis? It is because of this fear that General Cedillo suggested a method of striking against the rebels directly; rather than reinforce their ranks and fortify San Luis, and potentially leaving themselves vulnerable to enemy infiltration, Cedillo purposes instead to order a lockdown of the city and prepare an artillery bombardment against the city itself from a fortified position overlooking San Luis. Cedillo argues that the rebels, given that their fanaticism was shown to be almost psychotic at Veracruz, would not respond to the bombardment of San Luis rationally, making the enemy abandon their plans in the city in favor of a suicidal assault the army's fortified position, recklessly throwing their lives away to protect the people in San Luis Naturally, the general staff was horrified by the implications and ramifications of such a brutal plan, both for the plan's eerie resemblance to General Erich von Falkenhayn's unsuccessful strategy of attrition in the German offensive at the Battle of Verdun in the Weltkrieg as well as the obvious potential for immense numbers of civilian casualties of the population still trapped in the city."
mexico.166.a:0 "Order Cedillo to replenish his ranks and hunker down in San Luis."
mexico.166.b:0 "No more retreating! Cedillo's bombardment will proceed as planned."

mexico.167.t:0 "The Hurricane"
mexico.167.d:0 "Acquiescing to the authority of the Temporal Council, General Cedillo rode back into his stronghold in the city of San Luis Potosi, consolidating his forces from the local population and prepare to fend off against any resistance detected south of the city. The enemy they so feared would not descend upon them from the southern jungle...but from above...and within. The Nahua, the proud and indefatigable sons and daughters of the Aztec Empire, fiery and defiant, flying crop dusters and decades-old biplanes, flying so close to the ground they flew below the height of the buildings, almost kissing the street as they descended upon Cedillo's army from the air, the plane's pilots and passengers strafing the exposed soldiers with submachine gun and firebombs. At this, the paranoia espoused by Saturnino Cedillo was tragically and frighteningly proven right; just as the Nahua begun their attack, soldiers among the reconstituted army, conscripted into the ranks of the army from the citizenry of the city, turned their rifles on their companeros, screaming "Morir Es Vivir!" as their rifles cracked against, their traitorous air-bound comrades roaring overhead. It was not long before the city of San Luis Potosi was a mirror image of Veracruz; burnt and burning buildings, dead and dying soldiers, and the people, cunningly bewitched by the rebel air assault, began flowing out of their shelters, rioting in concert with the rebel's assault, trashing and burning all in their path. With the moral of the soldiery shattered and the army in danger of collapsing, General Cedillo ordered the withdrawal from San Luis, commanding the remnants to fall back to Mexico City."
mexico.167.a:0 "They cut a swath across the horizon, like Quetzalcoatl of old..."

mexico.169.t:0 "The Strongman of San Luis proves the worth of his name"
mexico.169.d:0 "Dusk fell over San Luis as the cannonade opened up, General Saturnino Cedillo, himself the wealthy, cunning and august governor of the very city he was now shelling, having realized the extent of Santa Muerte's influence over the common people at Veracruz and the zealotry they displayed in revolt, chose a strategy of incitement by using the people of San Luis as bait in goading the rebels into exposing themselves to the army's fortified position in the hills overlooking the city, setting up a defensive line against the lush, green jungle to the south with machine gun emplacements and pillboxes to defend against what the Field Marshal predicted would be an incensed, disorganized enemy. What happened next was something no one could have predicted; aircraft, outmoded biplanes for the most part, appeared over the horizon and began besieging the artillery emplacements from above just as the first of the rebels came roaring out of the jungle into the northern hills, harrying the defensive line with sniper fire, mortar fire, rifle fire and makeshift firebombs as the aircraft strafed the artillery emplacements with fly-by sub machine gun fire, and through it all, the drumfire of Cedillo's bombardment thundered against the city below, slowly and ruthlessly reducing San Luis to rubble as the creeping barrage continued to rake the city. But in this great duel of wits between General Cedillo and Santa Muerte's militia, the so-called Strongman of San Luis showed himself to be correct in his assumption of the recklessness of the rebel threat; man and woman were mowed down in human wave assaults to see the army dislodged from the heights, and the archaic state of the aircraft besieging the army meant that they were vulnerable to machine gun fire and were rapidly shot out the sky. By nightfall, dead bodies and burnt-out planes lined the hillside, the cannonade had ceased, the army worked to put out the fires in the city, and victory had been achieved."
mexico.169.a:0 "Curious that Cedillo's mansion was spared most of the damage..."

mexico.170.t:0 "The Knights of Sonora"
mexico.170.d:0 "With Santa Muerte having spread it's influence throughout the south of the country, it was only a matter of time before their teachings spread into the desolate deserts along our northern border, that moment has arrived, and has formulated itself into even more of a threat than anyone realized. The Catholics, the remnants of the christian faithful of Mexico, isolated in the badlands to the north, hithertoo untouched by the ARM's purges, have begun to resurge: Father José Reyes Vega, catholic priest, legendary Cristero general and an avowed enemy of Saturnino Cedillo, long thought to have died in exile, has returned, and with him, not only has he brought the militant zealotry and dogma of the Church he once fought for, but further intensified by a newfound faith in Santa Muerte and her teachings. In a radio broadcast wrought with the solemnity and imperturbability the priesthood is known for, he called upon the faithful warriors of Mexico, any and all who kneel before the light of the lord, to once more rise again in open rebellion, proclaiming formation of the so-called "Knights of Sonora" a new order of militants, ensconced in the deserts of northern Mexico where, like the Calatravans, Teutons and Templars before them, they proclaim a renewed holy war against the Temporal Council and the ARM regime, formally announcing their support for Maria III and calling for the faithful to march on Mexico City, believing that, as Maria III herself proclaimed, that God marches with them, and that the end of the Gold Shirt's persecutions is, at long last, at an end. In response to Vega's broadcast, the Temporal Council, fearing this northern revolt will soon join with the southern rebellion in an assault on the Capital, immediately order all available regiments of both the counter-revolutionary army and the Gold Shirt's militias to Mexico City."
mexico.170.a:0 "The noose is tightens further..."

mexico.171.t:0 "The March on Mexico City"
mexico.171.d:0 "Trepidation filled the air in the Capital City, even as the common people tried to go on about their day, the soldiers marching, the armored cars patrolling the streets, snipers on the rooftops, the checkpoints, the road blocks, and through it all, the creeping sense of dread as thehour of reckoning drew nearer. Both the army and the Temporal Council must have felt it too; the members of the Council leadership awaiting an update from General Cedillo, who himself sat outside the capital building with his army in the city center, watchful for any sign on corruption, as the first reports from the forward scouts over the radio made it clear to both the General and the Council that something was coming just as dark-clothed figures appeared in the distance. They were of all colors; soldiers and shipwrights, doctors and priests, cultists and cristeros, old men and woman to young girls and boys, all dressed in black, from elegant, embroidered suits and gowns all the way down to the  tattered garb of tramps, they painted their faces like the Day of the Dead, as beautiful as they were frightening, they marched in complete and utter silence through the streets of city, leaving many of the soldiery near-dumbfounded, as much by their sheer numbers, but for the ominous calm they displayed as they marched. And at the center of it all marched the beating heart of this silent rebellion: the Cousins Diaz were there, at the head of a contingent of Soldaderas, Don Tultengo was there, surrounded by his brave Nahua patriots, Father Vega was there, flanked by his pious Sonora Knights, and finally, the lady Maria III, dressed in the blue tunic, iron breastplate and steel pickelhaube of a viennese cuirassier, not the gown of a mere Habsburg courtier, but the garb of a true Kaiserin, an Empress. Having had enough of Maria III's impudence, a furious General Cedillo gave the order to open fire on the crowd, and from the radio, came a single, cold reply:"
mexico.171.a:0 "Morir Es Vivir!"
mexico.171.b:0 "Siempre Leales!"

mexico.172.t:0 "México Sobre Todo"
mexico.172.d:0 "At the center of Mexico City, under heavy rainfall, the first volley of the army opened fire across the plaza, followed by the screams of the condemned as the first of the marchers, many of them young children, fell dead by the armies bullets, their blood congealing in the mud under the feet before the rain swept them both away as their numbers were cut down to size. The crowd fractured seemingly in an instant, many of then scattering at the army's assault, and still more fell from the volley, woman, children, the elderly, no one was innocent in the eyes of the army, and none were spared ether; Father Vega and his Cristeros fell first, than the younger Porfirio Diaz, the Nahua ferociously tried to defend Don Tultengo before they too were gunned down, just as their king was captured by the Gold Shirt's militia men, the sound of their rifles booming in concert with the cracking of thunder. When the storm finally did subside, so too did any doubt that the army, and the ARM alongside them, had won the day, and upon his inspection of the massacre, Saturnino Cedillo would come upon a wounded Felix Diaz kneeling before the body of Maria III, the would-be Empress having been shot more than a hundred times, her long brown hair undone and fallen across her shoulders, laying on her back in a great pool of human blood, her arms wrapped around the bodies of her faithful, her face as white as the Bony Lady herself.  "Plans can change, even divine ones." Cedillo is rumored to have said to a defeated General Diaz before executing him on the spot. The victorious General Cedillo, cavalier at his success, rode back to the capital building on horseback to inform the Temporal Council of their triumph, and upon hs arrival, in an act mirroring Erich Ludendorf's Siege of Liege, greeted the leadership of Mexico by banging on the council chambers with the hilt of his saber, delivering the news that the Cult of Santa Muerte, along their insurrection, was no more."
mexico.172.a:0 "Declare a national celebration in honor of Saturnino Cedillo, in honor of Mexico!"

mexico.173.t:0 "The Deluge"
mexico.173.d:0 "It was a great thunderstorm raging in the skies over Mexico City that heralded the end of the Temporal Council; as an enraged Saturnino Cedillo screamed into his radio that the oncoming rebels be stopped dead in their tracks, the soldiery, meanwhile, sapped of all loyalty to ARM or their revolution, meekly lowered their rifles, bowing their heads, some even kneeling before the crowd as they made their journey forward, with the remainder of the Gold Shirts scattering like rats out of fear for their mortal souls. As the precession gathered near the door to the capital building, the Lady Maria Gizela de Iturbide von Habsburg, long thought to have died the night of the Gold Shirt's Putsch, now stood before the building where her mother and sister were murdered, her face painted like a skull, the rose-covered visage of La Calavera Catrina, rainwater glistening off the steel of her breastplate, the flash of lightning reflecting off her spiked Pickelhaube helmet, a leather-bound bible clutched in one hand, and a gold-encrusted Gasser revolver in the other; this was the new face of authority in Mexico, this was the face that would uproot the balance of power in the so-called "free world", both in this life, and the next. Field Marshal Saturnino Cedillo, at last, fell silent, the bellicose and ruthless Chief of the Army, the would-be architect of Maria's demise, stood at the foot of the door to the Capital, flanked by the few loyal militiamen of the Gold Shirts that hadn't fled already, the absolute last line between the Temporal Council and the retribution that was to soon overtake them. "You frighten me, General, and you have caused me great pain." the Lady told him, her cultured, Viennese accent clashing with the gothic figure that stood before him: "Now, you see how crude such things are as weapons, for both Fear and Pain only exist to be defeated." At this, she placed the bible against Cedillo's face before perforating it, and him, with a bullet. By the time the storm subsided, the bodies of every surviving member of both the Gold Shirts and the Temporal Council would be hanging from every streetlamp. A new american empire has been unleashed."

mexico_req.38.d:0 "The vast majority of the population in our new northern states are English speaking "Anglos" who are resisting our rule. They are well armed and many fear that they will try to rebel against us."
mexico_req.38.a:0 "The Gringos will learn to accept our rule"

mexico_req.39.t:0 "Gringo Riots!"
mexico_req.39.d:0 "The Anglo population in our occupied territories have staged a number of protests, ranging from peaceful gatherings and illegal parades to major protests and acts of vandalism. Obviously, it will take a really, really long time until these gringos accept our rightful rule over Tejas, Nuevo Mexico and Alta California…"
mexico_req.39.a:0 "Riots occur in major cities"

mexico_req.40.t:0 "Actions of the Anglo resistance"
mexico_req.40.d:0 "The resistance of the Anglo population against our occupation forces continues. Once again, terrorist groups operating within the Northern territories have staged a number of attacks aimed at crippling our infrastructure, our industrial output and the morale of our forces."
mexico_req.40.a:0 "Saboteurs bomb a number of important factories"

mexico_req.52.t:0 "Fate of Hollywood"
mexico_req.52.d:0 "With Alta California finally ours again, we need to decide what to do with its film industry, once a pillar of U.S. capitalist propaganda. The Comité is divided between leaving them be (barring our new film censorship and approval board), expropriation, and purging the area to build something far more useful for el pueblo. While industrialising the studios would boost California's recovery, the studios make a lot of taxable money, and our new citizens Norteños will be upset…"
mexico_req.52.a:0 "Leave them alone, remember they helped finance los Villistas"
mexico_req.52.b:0 "Consolidate the studios under government control"
mexico_req.52.c:0 "Hollywood belongs to its workers!"
mexico_req.52.e:0 "Purge the studios and build heavy industry!"

mexico_req.53.t:0 "Reorganisation of the Territories"
mexico_req.53.d:0 "National elation over La Reconquista continues in full swing. Unfortunately, overwhelming euphoria is not without its overzealous drawbacks. Recently, certain national activists, civil administrators and other (generally traditionalist) voices have advocated that since the old northern territories have returned to us, we should likewise return the nature of their civil administration along revanchist lines - that is, the former U.S. states should be redrawn to match the pre-1848 borders of Alta California, Nuevo Mexico, Texas, even the Oregon Territory if our new gains allow it. These 'conservatives' argue that such a reorganisation would centralise administration of the old U.S. states and streamline governance over the North while exalting Mexican pride and erasing the estadounidense colonialism over Mexico's ancestral lands. The 'progressive' faction, meanwhile, dismiss these borders as vague even for the time, and further denounce the scheme as archaic, impractical and bound to outrage the Anglos more than ever. Instead, the progressives argue, the established former U.S. State administrations are already functional, well-organised and stable, and therefore should be adopted in full and merely expanded upon. Today, the Comité de Ocupación del Norte is scheduled hold a meeting and to adjourn with a decision on the matter."
mexico_req.53.a:0 "Conservative: Revert to traditional borders"
mexico_req.53.b:0 "Progressive: Expand on existing state apparatus"

mexico_req.54.t:0 "The Fate of the Alamo"
mexico_req.54.d:0 "It was inevitable that the question of that decaying symbol known as the Alamo would arise. As it stands, the Alamo is a rallying point for insurrectionists and a shrine for the old regime. Therefore, a resolution has been called for to renovate the building and thus repurpose its symbolic value — but again, this may only serve to incur the wrath of the gringos. As per the directive of the Comité de Ocupación del Norte, the Alamo will be…"
mexico_req.54.a:0 "Preserved as a cultural heritage site"
mexico_req.54.b:0 "A war dead memorial"
mexico_req.54.c:0 "Demolished! With urban expansion built over it for good measure!"

mexico_req.55.t:0 "The Status of American Indians"
mexico_req.55.d:0 "With a change in government it is only natural that ostracised groups will seek support from the new government in hopes of finally overturning their fortunes. In this case, it is America's first peoples, with which we share a lineage of American nativity and European colonialism. Deprived also of their territory, as well as their sovereignty, Indians now live like zoo animals in reservations, where poverty is rampant, and the Indian Citizenship Act of 1936 does not go far enough in repairing centuries of subjugation. Therefore, we should expand on the act, as it is our moral imperative that we grant assistance to the destitute American Indian and begin lifting them from oppression at last."
mexico_req.55.a:0 "Yes, we stand alongside the oppressed Indian"
mexico_req.55.b:0 "Will we ever stop enraging the Americans with all the guns?!"
mexico_req.56.t:0 "Status of Women in the Territories"

mexico_req.56.d:0 "Anglo women have taken to the streets in planned demonstrations — not against Mexican occupation, but for women's rights. While generally critical of Mexico's actions, suffragists have decided to make the best of our progressive government and have thus petitioned Mexico to succeed where Washington failed — officially extend Mexico's Constitutional rights of women to the territories."
mexico_req.56.a:0 "Grant universal rights for all women!"
mexico_req.56.b:0 "Grant women voting rights in all local assemblies!"
mexico_req.56.c:0 "Now is not the best time"

mexico_req.57.t:0 "Status of Religion in the Territories"
mexico_req.57.d:0 "While Mexico has historically been a Catholic country, the Anglos take on the religious heritage of England, Protestantism. The people in the territories — Texas in particular — are deeply religious, so the Comité has to tread carefully on religious policy. It would be foolish, however, to ignore intelligence reports from our spy service which emphasise how the local churches are condoning, aiding and abetting the insurrectionists, many of whom are zealous Protestants themselves."
mexico_req.57.a:0 "Enforce Catholicism as the state religion"
mexico_req.57.b:0 "Enforce anti-clerical laws of 1917 Constitution"
mexico_req.57.c:0 "Let the Protestants freely go about their business"

mexico_req.58.t:0 "Status of Language in the Territories"
mexico_req.58.d:0 "The majority of both the Mexican and Anglo populations do not speak the others' language, which is already causing incidents in the territories. While forcing the entire Anglo population to learn and speak Spanish would be… impractical, perhaps some basic public works could assist our troops and settlers in the North. The principal subject of today's Comité meeting is: From schools and government to restaurants and street signs, what will be the official language in the territories?"
mexico_req.58.a:0 "Español"
mexico_req.58.b:0 "Bilingüe/Bilingual"
mexico_req.58.c:0 "English"

mexico_req.59.t:0 "The Reintegration of the Mexican Cession"
mexico_req.59.d:0 "After many years of extensive resettlement, intensive propaganda efforts and numerous crushed uprisings, organised revolt against Mexican governance has largely subsided. While some resistance persists among old militia extremists, Anglos at large have gradually come to terms with our rule and settlers are now a significant minority in the North. With Los Territorios Reconquistados firmly under our control, we've won unhindered access to its resources and industry."
mexico_req.59.a:0 "Finally!"

mexico_req.9.t:0 "Reclaiming our lost territories"
mexico_req.9.d:0 "In 1848, as a result of our defeat in the Mexican-American War, we were forced to cede nearly half of our territory to the United States as per the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The reversion of this treaty has been a dream for the Mexican people since then. Now, with the USA at war, this could be our chance to regain our lost lands and reassert Mexican control north of the Rio Grande, from California all the way to Texas! The Americans can only cede land they still control, however, so we must move quickly!"
mexico_req.9.a:0 "Demand the return of our territories"
mexico_req.9.b:0 "We can't afford direct conflict, just stake our claims"
mexico_req.9.c:0 "Are you mad? This is too dangerous!"

mexico_req.10.t:0 "Mexican territorial demands"
mexico_req.10.d:0 "Mexico has decided to use the ongoing American Civil War as an opportunity to reclaim the territories they lost to us due to the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo! How should we react?"
mexico_req.10.a:0 "Cede disputed territory, we can't afford another front"
mexico_req.10.b:0 "Never! Those lands are American!"

mexico_req.11.t:0 "The Americans refuse our demands"
mexico_req.11.d:0 "The foolish leadership of the United States has refused to accept our rightful territorial claims. What shall we do now?"
mexico_req.11.a:0 "War will solve this!"
mexico_req.11.b:0 "We are not ready for war"
mexico_req.11.c:0 "Cut the Mexicans a Deal"

mexico_req.110.t:0 "The Yanqui Offer"
mexico_req.110.d:0 "in exchange for getting the mexican cession back, the Mexicans help us beat the AUS and PSA in the war"
mexico_req.110.a:0 "Sounds Good"

mexico_req.111.b:0 "No"

mexico_req.12.t:0 "The second Mexican-American War"
mexico_req.12.d:0 "Our refusal to accept the Mexican territorial claims was the last straw. They decided to declare war upon us in order to try to gain those disputed territories by force. Now, troops of the National Guard, together with volunteers from the local population, are being mobilised to repel the Mexican assaults!"

mexico_req.13.a:0 "Sue for peace, we have had enough"
mexico_req.13.b:0 "We shall keep on fighting"

mexico_req.14.t:0 "The Mexicans Offer Peace"
mexico_req.14.d:0 "What a disaster! A good portion of our southern states have been lost to the advancing Mexican Army. The Mexicans have offered us peace, and will simply keep whatever claimed land they already control. With their troops threatening to advance even deeper, this is the time to accept our defeat and cede them the disputed territory."

##Army Generals##

ARMY_MEX_EMILIANO_ZAPATA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 8, in Anenecuilco, Morelos, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W Emiliano Zapata Salazar's military career began shortly after his political activism began, when he was forcefully conscripted into the 9th Cavalry regiment under Alfonso Pradillo in 1908, where he began experiencing the benefits and drawbacks of military life. With the Plan de San Luis going into effect and the death of Pablo Torres Burgos, Emiliano was chosen by the Southern Revolutionary Junta as the new revolutionary chief of the Southern Maderista Army. His first course of action was to take Cuautla from Porfirista forces, which was successful despite suffering heavy casualties. In order to increase recruitment, he promised every soldier who signed up with him a piece of arable land for themselves in exchange for their help in the revolution, and this tactic proved to be extremely successful with the disenfranchised peasants of the Mexican countryside."
ARMY_MEX_PANCHO_VILLA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 5, 1878, in San Juan del Rio, Durango, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W José Doroteo Arango Arámbula, better known by his pseudonym, Francisco Villa or his nickname 'Pancho Villa', has become a living legend for the people of Mexico. He started his adventure when Laureano Lopez Negrete, the owner of the Sombretillo Ranch where Doroteo worked, abused his older sister. In reprisal, he shot Laureano, and then evaded capture from the authorities, after which he escaped to the nearby mountains, where he was found by a gang of bandits lead by a man called Francisco Villa. He'd accompany the bandits for years, raiding and pillaging around Durango until Francisco Villa was shot in a firefight, and named Doroteo his succesor to lead the gang. Doroteo then adopted the name of his saviour, and continued his criminal activity. With the leadership of the gang secured, Villa decided to join forces with Ignacio Parra, and started his attempts to stop, sometimes violently, the abuses committed by the landlords to the peasants in Chihuahua. In the late 1910 he'd join the Movimiento Maderista, and through cunning and bravery, 'Pancho Villa' reached the higher ranks of the Mexican Revolutionary Army with the nickname 'The Centaur of the North', and even managed to shortly become Governor of Chihuahua.
