### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_EMILIANO_ZAPATA_DESC:0 "Serving as a hero and leading figure within the bloody Mexican Revolution, Emiliano Zapata is one of the most respected, as well as one of the most divisive, figures in the nation. Born in Morelos in 1879, Emiliano Zapata Salazar was born into a well-off and popular family of mestizo famers. This rural upbringing greatly influenced his later views, but despite popular claims that he began life as an impoverished child of native blood, Zapata’s upbringing was decently comfortable. Regardless, after receiving basic education and with the death of his father while Zapata was just 16, the future hero of Mexico was forced to shoulder the burden of caring for his family, starting off on a series of odd jobs and entrepreneurial ventures. \nWith the rise of the Porfirio Díaz regime, Zapata and his local town of Anenecuilco - long a hotbed of anti-elitist thought - began to once more vigorously protest the expanding hacienda system, and after meeting with Díaz to a discuss possible deal, Zapata and his allies were arrested and conscripted into the Federal Army - a sentence that would come to benefit him given the great martial experience it granted him. After returning home, Zapata was elected as the new chief elder of his hometown with the retirement of Josė Merino, and would continue to rally his allies against the hacienda system and against the Díaz regime until the Mexican Revolution finally broke out a few years later. Allying with Pancho Villa and later Álvaro Obregón, Zapata proved to be a masterful guerilla tactician, and with his help, the Socialists came out victorious in the war. \nFollowing the Mexican Revolution and after three back-to-back PLM presidents, Zapata broke their political monopoly and achieved victory in Mexico's 1932 Presidential election with his PNA. Since taking office, he has promoted the development of Mexico's collective farms, 'Ejidos', and through economic incentives and with Mexican oil on offer, has fostered close diplomatic ties with the Third Internationale. However, his vaguely Socialist stances and deeply Socialist allies have angered many, causing radical anti-Socialists and antagonized democratic elements to assemble and take action across the nation. With instability and civil strife rearing their ugly heads once more, Zapata and his regime must take care, for a coming storm is brewing over Mexico once more."
POLITICS_PLUTARCO_CALLES_DESC:0 "General Plutarco Calles has seized control of the Mexican government. While the totalitarian and rabidly anti-clerical tone of Calles's rhetoric are typical of Mexican socialist politicians, his rejection of agrarianism and support for full integration of indigenous Mexicans could represent a radical new direction for Mexico if implemented."
POLITICS_PANCHO_VILLA_DESC:0 "Francisco 'Pancho' Villa's military victories against the armies of dictator Victoriano Huerta, such critical steps on the path to socialist revolution in Mexico, remain legendary in Mexico and abroad. Villa, while often at odds with Zapata, is similarly an agrarian socialist."
POLITICS_PABLO_GONZALEZ_GARZA_DESC:0 "General Pablo Gonzalez Garza was once a steadfast ally of former president Carranza. With the death of Carranza and the ascent of Alvaro Obregón to the Mexican presidency, he went into hiding, waiting for the opportune moment to cleanse his beloved Mexico of socialist corruption; with the success of a military coup in Mexico, he is poised to do just that."
POLITICS_JOSE_URQUIZA_DESC:0 "Jose Antonia Urquiza, fervent catholic and anti-socialist, has outmaneuvred his ostensible allies within the Mexican military to assume control of the presidency. President Urquiza is as certain to promote faith in his Sinarquist regime as faith in God Himself."
POLITICS_VINCENTE_TOLEDANO_DESC:0 "Vicente Toledano, personal aide and confidant of former president, Zapata, has now become president in his own right. He advocates a synthesis between European style syndicalism and Mexican agrarianism, whereby the state supports the industrialisation and unionisation of the collectivised farms, 'Ejidos'."
POLITICS_LAZARO_CARDENAS_DESC:0 "Lazaro Cardenas of the moderate Partido Revolucionario Institucional has achieved victory in Mexico's presidential election. His platform is of reconciliation with Zapatistas and the Catholic Church alike."
POLITICS_DONA_ITURBIDE_DESC:0 "Doña María Josephia Sophia de Habsburgo-Itúrbide has been crowned Empress of the new Mexican Monarchy. She traces descent from both Mexico's final indigenous Emperor and the adopted son of Maximillian. As an Austrian, her ascension to the throne has fostered closer ties between Austria and Mexico."
POLITICS_DON_FERNANDO:0 "Don Fernando de Tultengo has been crowned King of Mexico. His legitimacy is based upon descent from the final Aztec Tlatoani, Moctezuma, and thus he lacks the dynastic links which could entangle the fate of Mexico with that of another."
POLITICS_DON_LUIS:0 "Don Luis de Tultengo has been crowned King of Mexico. His legitimacy is based upon descent from the final Aztec Tlatoani, Moctezuma, and thus he lacks the dynastic links which could entangle the fate of Mexico with that of another."

POLITICS_CARRASCO_MEGA_LARP_DESC:0 "Taking the name of the first Aztec Tlaotoani and founder of the Aztec Empire Itzcoatl, Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco has abandoned his Spanish heritage entirely to embrace the true culture of Mexico. Rising to lead the restored and reforged ‘Neo-Aztec Empire,’ Itzcoatl II seeks to guide what was once Mexico into a new age free of colonial taint and foreign influences. Taking complete control of the state with the aid of his loyalists within the New Guard of the Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista while betraying his once-ally Roque Garza, a new triple alliance - or Ēxcān Tlahtōlōyān - has been formed; not of three different Mexica clans, but of three new pillars to uphold the new empire: faith, people, and nation. With the revived Aztec faith supporting our people and bolstering our new national identity, Itzcoatl II’s new empire shall surely not fail as the man once known as Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco takes the future of the Mexica people solely in his grasp."
POLITICS_CARRASCO_DESC:0 "Champion of the Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista and the new Mexican state, Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco is the current strongman and national father of our revitalized nation. Born in Chihuahua in 1890, Carrasco was born under the shadow of the Porfiriato. Entering the national scene after a standard upbringing during the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, Carrasco initially fought alongside the likes of both Pancho Villa and Huerta, flipping sides and swapping allegiances before breaking off to form his own nationalist paramilitary that became the Gold Shirts of the ARM. Slowly growing his movement from a simple gang of nationalist brigands into a well-oiled and highly veteran military force, the ARM eventually transitioned to become a party and national movement. With his ally Roque Garza aiding him, the ARM seized power from Pablo Garza in the wake of his coup after Zapata’s assassination, and after the ARM’s own internal power struggle was concluded, Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco stood alone. Now, with all of Mexico in the palm of his hand, a new Mexico shall be forged in a baptism of fire. With his pre-colonial tastes and eccentricities well-known within the party and with no one powerful or influential enough to further provide obstacles, Carrasco plans to guide Mexico towards its classical and rightful heritage, embracing Aztec and Mexica culture while removing all traces of colonialism, Socialism, free Capitalism, and Catholicism from the nation."

### Ideas ###
MEX_new_economic_policy_idea:0 "Nueva Política Económica"
MEX_new_economic_policy_idea_desc:0 "The Nueva Política Económica, or NEP, was created by the post-Revolutionary government as an expediency measure aimed at breathing life into our war-ravaged economy. Mixing state-run Socialist and small-scale Capitalist policies together into a cohesive and syncretic economic plan, the NEP has been a shaky attempt by the new regime to forcibly bring prosperity to Mexico. Using both free market and nationalized industries and methods, the NEP has been met with mixed results, and now the nation must decide whether to continue these drastic, fused policies, or must a Great Break be organized to dive Mexico headfirst into its crimson future."

MEX_revolution_economic:0 "The Revolution’s Economic Fallout"
MEX_revolution_economic_desc:0 "The Revolución Mexicana blew apart the old order and from the ashes our new society has risen, but this crimson transformation did not come without a price. The revolution completely destabilized and reshaped the nation, and has taken a heavy toll on Mexico’s overall ability to function, primarily when it comes to our economic sector which was absolutely decimated in the conflict. Our industry was ravaged and scavenged by fighters and opportunists on all sides, roads, railways, and telegraph lines are in ruin, and those farms and ranches that weren't ransacked by Zapata's militias were burned in a Scorched Earth policy to starve out the revolution. It will take an extensive and thorough reconstruction effort to stitch the country back together again and restore Mexico's economy to working order."

MEX_revolution_military:0 "Outdated and Unmotivated Military"
MEX_revolution_military_desc:0 "Mexico has seemingly been cursed for the better part of a century with an inability to properly modernize, industrialize, or militarize, with the woefully underdeveloped state of our armed forces serving as a blatant and sore example of this ineptitude. From doctrine to logistics and even up the entire chain of command, the whole of Mexico's military might is compromised. This military inadequacy has progressed to the point that Mexico might be markedly unprepared for the realities that another major conflict would bring. \n\nWe face a harsh reality - half of our own armaments date back to the first Weltkrieg or earlier as literal museum pieces, the navy is little more than a boutique fleet defending our closest coastal waters and interior waterways, and the air force is all but non-existent. However, not all hope is lost. With the Revolution having wrested control of the nation's industry and with the increased attention paid to the nation’s domestic oil wealth, it is possible, and vital, that Mexico evolve beyond the ad hoc nature of Zapata's militias and towards a more modern and efficient military structure."

MEX_asa_rebellion:0 "Rebellion of the Alianza Antisocialista"
MEX_asa_rebellion_desc:0 "Since the Revolution toppled the regime of Victoriano Huerta and Porfirio Díaz, Mexico has seen new faces rise and fall until war hero Emiliano Zapata was elected, with each new leader attempting to drive the post-Revolutionary state into their desired direction. All along the way and regardless of who held the reigns of power, the nation has been plagued with an increasingly radicalized right-wing coalition of anti-Socialist nationalist cliques. \n\nComposed of a wide array of right-wing and far-right movements, the AAS is chiefly represented by the staunchly traditionalist militia of the Partido Nacional Integralista (PNI), the ultra-religious synarchists of the Partido Fuerza Popular (PFP) and the racial ideologues of the anti-clerical, anti-establishment Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista (ARM), and along with other smaller groups, this anti-Leftist coalition shares little in common aside from their shared hate for Socialism. While the right-wing triumvirate is far from a stable alliance, with both the PNI and PFP loudly voicing their disdain for the ARM, their presence shows an ever growing antipathy with the revolutionary government of Zapata and the Syndicalists. With their attacks only growing more bold as the Red regime continues to lord over Mexico, many fear the AAS will plunge the nation back into war. If these ultra-nationalist fifth columnists aren't dealt with swiftly, Mexico might find itself at the mercy of yet another counter-revolution."

MEX_dl_opposition:0 "Opposition from the Liga Democrática"
MEX_dl_opposition_desc:0 "Although the transition of power in Mexico to a Socialist Republic was far from peaceful, the election of 1932 that saw Zapata's rise to power meant that the ex-incumbents of the former republican establishment would once again be relegated as a fringe group, leaving them as a marginalized but very vocal political opponent dedicated to serve as a roadblock to anything the Socialist government intended to put forward. Making matters worse, it is not just the conservative right of the previous establishment that are against the government of Zapata, for many liberal and moderate politicians and parties are joining the Liga Democrática, voicing their desires for change. Harkening back to the Carrancistas of the Revolution, these republicans and constitutionalists believe the sitting government to be one step too close to mob rule. The current administration certainly has a lot of work to do to broker an accommodation with these whimpering republicans, lest the infantile Socialist regime suffer yet another setback on their path to securing Mexico's political future."

MEX_church_question:0 "The Question of the Church"
MEX_church_question_desc:0 "Since the days of the original Spanish Conquest, the presence of the Catholic Church has had a profound and ever-present influence on the culture and traditions of contemporary Mexico. Although the Syndicalist government of Zapata has made a concerted effort to secularize Mexico, the Catholic Church still holds great power over the hearts and minds of the Mexican People. It is clear that, unless some kind of an accord with the clergy and it's faithful laity is met, a more direct and forceful means of addressing the "Opiate of the People" may have to be contemplated. Until then, the secular and pious populations of our state are at each other's throats, and with baseless rumors spreading that Zapata wishes to push for full anti-clericalism as pro-Church groups continue to radicalize, Mexico has been pushed to balance on a razor’s edge."

Our noble President is to give a speech to his constituents, explaining to them his future plans for our noble people's republic. Despite his nerves, and some rumors of violent detractors being distributed throughout the crowd outside in the Zócalo, President Zapata readies himself to speak to his people. Surely nothing will go wrong on this beautiful, picturesque day..."
MEX_zapata_slain:0 "Zapata Slain!"
MEX_zapata_slain_desc:0 "Shock and horror have spread throughout the nation with the news that our President Zapata has been slain! Murdered where he stood at the podium, shot down and forced to wither away in a pool of his own blood before thousands of his loving subjects, this national hero has been reduced to a mere rotting corpse. Now, with his brother Eufemio Zapata taking temporary charge of the nation as a largely apolitical interim President, our Mexico stands at a crossroads while our foes circle like wolves, waiting for their chance to strike..."
MEX_zapata_lives:0 "The Caudillo Lives!"
MEX_zapata_lives_desc:0 "Despite the vile intentions of the gunman, President Emiliano Zapata has survived the assassination attempt during his address to the nation. Now, with the national government on high alert and paranoid about additional reactionary attacks, all of Mexico is alert and in chaos. It is now up to President Zapata and his close allies to wrest back control of Mexico."

With the Zapata regime now thrown into chaos and with reactionary, republican, monarchist, and Christian groups -among others - taking this opportunity to cause mayhem once again, our once pristine people’s republic has been dragged into the chaotic pit of the unknown. The future of our nation and of our people now hangs in the balance as varied forces across the nation prepare to do battle for the heart of Mexico once more. We have no choice but to march into this abyss, ignorant to the possibilities but prepared for the unknown as best we can."

MEX_DL_dl_victorious_desc:0 "With the forces of authoritarianism and radical Socialism now laid to rest, the Liga Democrática - or Democratic League - has risen as the heralds of our new future. Mexico shall once again know the liberty and freedom associated with true and fair democracy as we move forward to create a pure republican system. With the wide and varied democratic coalition that is the LD creating a provisional government to guide Mexico through the process of democratization, soon the bedrock of our new republic shall be decided upon and laid as we slowly march to create a new constitution and hold our first free elections."
MEX_DL_military_question:0 "The Military Question"
MEX_DL_military_question_desc:0 "With our national history of military coups, revolutions, war, and violence being so prolific in the minds of all members of the LD, this temporary governing body has decided to reorganize our armed forces into a modern apolitical military. However, what to do with our former generals has caused quite the internal debate. We must decide to simply force the Old Guard to retire, or possibly allow them a each a pardon if they agree to disavow any and all political ties they may have once held. Regardless, we must foster a strong next generation of generals and admirals as we build a loyal and apolitical force to defend the nation."

MEX_DL_restore_the_monarchy:0 "Restore the Monarchy"
MEX_DL_restore_the_monarchy_desc:0 "After fierce debate and almost-violent argumentation between ministers within the Liga Democrática, the future executive structure of the nation has finally been decided. Shocking many, and deeply angering the more liberal and progressive ministers within the provisional government under the LD, it has been decided that the Mexican monarchy - not seen since 1867 - shall once again rise to grace this Earth. Supported heavily by members within the PRUN and PAN, a new imperial system based upon the First Mexican Empire of Agustín de Iturbide shall rise from Mexico City and stretch to all corners of our nation. Now, all that is left to do is lay the groundwork of this new monarchy before we are able to crown our new King and Emperor, and before we can hold parliamentary elections."
MEX_DL_term_limits:0 "Parliamentary Term Limits"
MEX_DL_term_limits_desc:0 "We cannot allow ‘democratically’ elected leaders to continue to control the course of the nation for decades at a time, for that would only steal power away from our eventual sovereign and the people as it amasses in the hands of corrupt republicans. Due to the nature of parliamentary politics, elected Prime Ministers will have one shot at re-election during their term and, unless a snap election is called, they are held every 5 years. In effect, this means the maximum amount of time a Prime Minister can serve is 10 years, though they can always be recalled early by the parliament or by our monarch if need be. This will ensure that no elected official can cement themselves into the seat of power for too long, and that at the end of the day, the monarch will have the greatest say in any debate."
MEX_DL_constitutional_monarchy:0 "An Enlightened Constitutional Monarchy"
MEX_DL_constitutional_monarchy_desc:0 "Though we march to restore the monarchy in all its glory, we cannot let it fall prey to the same ills that plagued it in the past. Though our first empire was a constitutional monarchy on paper, it was plagued by a parliament that did not want to compromise or cooperate, leading to the old monarchy being ineffectual, hamstrung by legal challenges, and eventually to it being deposed in just over a year. We must right these past wrongs, and work to create a monarchy that truly obeys the constitution and a parliament that only aids the monarchy in their shared duty of caring for the people and the state."
MEX_DL_apolitical_judges:0 "Apolitical Judges"
MEX_DL_apolitical_judges_desc:0 "In order to build a fair and unbiased judicial system, we must only allow apolitical judges from ever serving on the bench. From the lowest county court to the Supreme Court of Justice, all hopeful judiciaries must disavow any and all political connections before being sworn in, and must stay politically-detached and unbiased for the length of their service, lest they be found out as biased charlatans and removed from office by the monarchy."
MEX_DL_a_new_constitution:0 "A New Constitution"
MEX_DL_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "The vile constitution penned after the vitriolic Mexican Revolution is a putrid document of Liberal naivety and Socialist infection. We cannot allow this deeply flawed document to form the basis of our new constitutional monarchy. Instead, the majority of delegates within the LD have decided that a new constitution is to be drafted from scratch, based slightly on our first constitution penned at the Congress of Anahuac, as well as drawing influence from the German and old 1906 Russian constitutions as well. Enshrining what it means to be Mexican in our newly restored Empire, this new constitution will form the framework of our modern monarchy."
MEX_DL_mass_exiling:0 "Mass Exiling"
MEX_DL_mass_exiling_desc:0 "Though we have taken control of the nation and begun to cement the authority of our reborn monarchy, Socialist vermin and anti-monarchist elements still roam the nation as bandits, criminals, or loud-mouthed detractors. In order to stabilize the realm and to rid ourselves of these parasites, we shall legally exile them all from our borders. Our loyal troops shall roam the nation in search of those foolish enough not to leave on their own accord, and drive these rats from our restored empire."
MEX_DL_the_kingdom_of_mexico:0 "The Monarchy of Mexico Reborn"
MEX_DL_the_kingdom_of_mexico_desc:0 "Like it was 1822 or 1864 all over again, monarchism has been brought back to Mexico like a phoenix from the ashes. Though we have yet to name our monarch - though it is likely to be Maria Josefa de Iturbide, the preparations are well underway as we announce to our people and the world that the Third Mexican Empire- or if we so choose, the new Kingdom of Mexico - now rises from the ashes of its predecessor. With Socialist bandits still roaming the nation and with the parliamentary framework of our new government still being established, this is but a first step on the road to our new destiny."

MEX_DL_enter_the_cities:0 "Cleanse the Cities"
MEX_DL_enter_the_cities_desc:0 "The many cities of our nation, from Mexico City to Tijuana, serve as dens for our detractors and hives of Socialist unrest. In order to prepare the nation for republicanism, each and every city in the nation shall be patrolled and cleansed of violent partisans and bandits. Only with our major urban population centers under our control can we truly begin to effectively and efficiently administer this nation in full."
MEX_DL_secure_the_countryside:0 "Corral the Countryside"
MEX_DL_secure_the_countryside_desc:0 "Though our cities may be slowly coming under our control, the countryside of Mexico is still a wild and lawless place. With mesas, deserts, mountain ranges, jungles, and more wild expanses crawling with enemies of the state, we must march in our loyal troops in order to secure these hinterlands. Republicanism shall stretch to reach every corner of Mexico, and we shall ensure it through any means necessary, for no one can tame these wilds but us."
MEX_DL_democracy_secured:0 "Democracy Secured"
MEX_DL_democracy_secured_desc:0 "With our cities leashed and our countryside tamed, democracy has been secured in this wild land. Republicanism is now free to flourish in our newly cleansed nation, and any foe large enough to form an obstacle to this free and fair destiny has been dealt with through legislation or by the protectors of the state. Now, Mexico and its people march into their new, equal destiny, without fear of retaliation from our violent detractors."

MEX_DL_maintain_the_presidency:0 "Maintain the Presidency"
MEX_DL_maintain_the_presidency_desc:0 "Though past presidents have certainly failed this nation and our people, that is not to say that the idea of a presidential republic is flawed - just that the men we have allowed to rule in the past have had their own interests at heart instead of the needs and will of their constituents. To rectify these past grievances against democracy, we shall keep the position of President, and ensure that only sound, uncorrupt men come to hold the position. Only then, with a paragon of republican justice holding the reigns of power, can our democratic republic and our nation truly be free."
MEX_DL_presidential_republic:0 "An Illuminated Presidential Republic"
MEX_DL_presidential_republic_desc:0 "Republicanism is the most noble and fair system of governance in history, and we shall wrap Mexico in the warm embrace of democracy in order to bring this noble system to our own people. Centered around an elected president and with a uncorrupt congress at their back, our government shall rise above the ills of the past to guide our new Mexican Republic into a fair and free future."
MEX_DL_prohibit_reelections:0 "Prohibit Re-Elections"
MEX_DL_prohibit_reelections_desc:0 "In order to safeguard democracy for generations to come, the same elected leaders will not be allowed to dominate the political landscape for decades. Going forwards, all future Presidents of Mexico shall only be allowed to rule for one term of a yet-undetermined length. After their term is up, or if removed from power by congress early, it will be up to their leading party to raise another candidate to take their place in the following elections. With this policy in place, no longer shall ‘democratically’ elected presidents be able to rule for years without competition or pushback."
MEX_DL_reform_the_constitution:0 "Reform the Constitution"
MEX_DL_reform_the_constitution_desc:0 "The Revolutionary Constitution signed after the conclusion of the Mexican Revolution may have its flaws, and may reek of Socialism’s taint, but it stands as a stable framework for the ministers of the Liga Democrática to build off of. By editing this tainted document to fit our needs and by incorporating our own ideas of fair republicanism, as well as notes from the American, Brazilian, and Canadian constitutions, we shall forge a new and reformed document ready to serve as the foundation for our new democracy."
MEX_DL_democratic_judges:0 "Democratic Judges"
MEX_DL_democratic_judges_desc:0 "To keep our judiciary free of corruption and wholly dedicated to upholding democratic virtues and freedoms, all judges in the nations, from the Supreme Court of Justice all the way down to the smallest county court, must be sworn and dedicated members of one of our allowed democratic parties - though while on the bench they will be expected to leave all biases at the door. In this way, we shall hopefully keep radical influences and corruption from seeping into our justice system while providing fair, unfettered justice to any and all in the nation."
MEX_DL_the_republic_of_mexico:0 "The Republic of Mexico"
MEX_DL_the_republic_of_mexico_desc:0 "Like the noble and free eagle that soars across our skies, serving as one of the oldest symbols of our nation, our newly reforged republic too freely soars as fair and free democracy is brought to the people of Mexico. Under the provisional unity government of the Liga Democrática, republicanism is finally free to blossom and flourish across our lands. With the constitutional convention and later our first fair elections both looming, soon the voices of the Mexican people shall finally be heard and heeded."
MEX_DL_mass_arrests:0 "Mass Arrests"
MEX_DL_mass_arrests_desc:0 "Though we have allowed open elections, only banning the most radical of groups and allowing even moderate Socialists to freely compete, our nation is still filled with anti-democratic elements from both sides of the aisle that seek to smother our infantile republic before it can truly take flight. To preemptively deal a vital blow to these groups, loyal soldiers and police forces shall be sent into the badlands to capture these banditos and bring them to justice. Only behind bars, or if they run a shallow grave, can these vile Socialist and reactionary radicals truly be of no threat to our democracy."

MEX_DL_emergency_elections:0 "Convocar un Nuevo Congreso Constituyente"
MEX_DL_emergency_elections_desc:0 "With true democracy finally returning to our Mexico, a new Constituent Congress has convened to draft a new Constitución Política de México - or Political Constitution of Mexico. From our first independent congress under the Spanish -  the Congress of Anahuac - to the liberal Constitution of 1857, and even to our most recent one drafted in the wake of the Mexican Revolution, constitutionalism has been deeply embedded into Mexican ideals of republicanism and democracy for centuries. With our ministers and politicians convening in the capital to draft this hallowed document before our first elections can be held, the nation awaits eagerly for the official birth of our reforged republican system!"

MEX_GOL_old_or_new:0 "Towards the Future or Our Past?"
MEX_GOL_old_or_new_desc:0 "With our coup against both the old regime and our once-allies in the AAS proving to be successful, Roque González Garza and Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco now stand as the two most powerful men in Mexico. Both leading figures of the Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista, - more commonly called the Camisas Doradas, or Gold Shirts, - these two strongmen each have wildly different visions for the future of our state. As such, an internal power struggle has arisen between Carrasco and Garza, and whoever wins shall solely decide the destiny of our newly-freed nation!"

MEX_GOL_new_guard_victorious:0 "Carrasco’s New Guard Victorious"
MEX_GOL_new_guard_victorious_desc:0 "Sidestepping and out-maneuvering Garza at every turn, Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco has secured his position as both head of the ARM and the leading figure of our new Mexico. Notable for his pre-colonial fixation, hatred of colonial religions and culture, and desire for a state-planned and controlled economy, Carrasco seeks to harken to our nation’s post-classical past in order to propel us into a post-colonial future."
MEX_GOL_destroy_catholicism:0 "Annihilate Colonial Catholicism"
MEX_GOL_destroy_catholicism_desc:0 "Catholicism, despite its deeply ingrained position within Mexican society, is foreign to our people. Brought here by Spanish colonists and conquistadors hundreds of years ago, this Italian-based faith has robbed Mexico of its natural faith, culture, and identity. In an effort to bring about a truly Mexican society, Carrasco has declared that Catholicism, as well as all other foreign religions, are to be entirely banned from the nation. Their clergy shall be hunted down or forced into exile, and their ‘holy’ institution shall be brought to the flame. Mexico will be free of foreign religion and foreign gods!"
MEX_GOL_bring_back_aztec_beliefs:0 "Embrace and Purify the Nahua Faith"
MEX_GOL_bring_back_aztec_beliefs_desc:0 "With colonial religions and the Catholic Church being eradicated as we speak, a new faith must rise to meet the spiritual needs of our people, for though we have abandoned God, we have not turned our backs on gods. The Nahua faith - a syncretic mix of Catholic teachings and pre-colonial Mexica religion - proves to be a stable starting ground for our national religion conversion. By eradicating any trace of Catholic spirituality and uplifting and reviving the nascent Aztec beliefs, we shall use the Nahua faith to herald in a new age for Mexican culture and spirituality; one wrapped in the embrace of our mighty pre-colonial heritage."
MEX_GOL_the_old_religion:0 "Praise the Teotl"
MEX_GOL_the_old_religion_desc:0 "The ‘Teotl’ were the gods of the Mexica people and beyond, with even the Maya to the south once recognizing their divinity. Not just meaning gods in the strictest sense, but also the very manifestation of life and death, energy, spirituality, natural phenomena, and the ebbing and flowing life force that permeates all existence, the Teotl were the central pillar of our ancestors’ spirituality and metaphysical culture. They stood as the noble pantheon of our ancestors and of the mighty Aztec Empire itself. We were right to abandon the Christian ‘God’ in favor of these unfathomable beings of pure and raw power. These deities and the religion that surrounds them shall be revived, once again becoming the central pillar of culture and identity in the lands of the Mexica."
MEX_GOL_heirs_of_the_aztecs:0 "Heirs to the Aztecs"
MEX_GOL_heirs_of_the_aztecs_desc:0 "We are the sons of those who built Tenochtitlan! The children of the Teotl, the heirs of the first Huey Tlatoani, and the kin of Moctezuma Zocoyotzin himself. From Itzcoatl to Cuauhtémoc, the Tlatoani, or kings, of our fallen empire did their best to resist our enemies, colonial or otherwise, and in their failures they laid the seeds for our eventual victory! We are their descendants, and with their spirits guiding us, we shall revive the empire that the false Teotl Hernán Cortés conquered nearly 500 years ago. The Ēxcān Tlahtōlōyān shall rise again - now not as a triple alliance of three powerful Mexica clans, but as a new triple alliance of faith, people, and nation! These three pillars will guide us as we build not only a new Mexico, but a new Aztec Empire itself!"
MEX_GOL_the_warrior_state:0 "The Cuāuhocēlōtl State"
MEX_GOL_the_warrior_state_desc:0 "Cuāuhocēlōtl - a combination of the Aztec words for their famed eagle and jaguar warriors of cuāuhtli and ocēlōtl respectively - were the most feared and veteran of the Aztec Empire’s vast armies, second only in prestige to the Shorn Ones - or Cuachicqueh - but far greater in number and infamy. These honorable warrior societies, as well as others such as the Papalotl and the Cuextecatl shall be revived to form the basis of our newly reorganized military. These honored souls shall be put first above all other aspects of the state, for they are our protectors and the arbiters of justice and our Tlatoani’s will. Our new Mexico shall become one of the most militarized and martially-orientated nations on earth - a true warrior’s state if ever there was one."
MEX_GOL_will_of_the_quetzalcoatl:0 "The True Sons of Quetzalcoatl"
MEX_GOL_will_of_the_quetzalcoatl_desc:0 "Of all the Teotl in our polytheistic pantheon, one deity stands above all others as the perfect embodiment of our new state. The great feathered serpent is our link to the mythical Toltecs, proving that we and not our neighbors are the true heirs of the Teotl. The Plumed Serpent is our principle and patron god, Quetzalcoatl represents the ever-changing winds that carry us to victory and our new future, the luminous morning star that guides us, and the essence of life itself. From his shimmering feathers, our very people were birthed, and under his divine watch, our people now prosper once again - finally free of the clutches of the false Christian ‘God.’ Though all the other Teotl, from the sinful Tlazotleotl to the savage Mixcoatl, shall be revered and praised by our state and our people, Quetzalcoatl shall lord above all as the embodiment of our new Mexico."
MEX_GOL_take_the_reins:0 "Seize the Reins"
MEX_GOL_take_the_reins_desc:0 "The economy, like the state, must be fully harnessed and driven by the state, for only the national government has the know-how and the resources to truly steer our industry and financial systems to true prosperity. All aspects of the state and its finances shall slowly come to be coalesced within our hands, for only Carrasco and the ARM can truly know what is best for Mexico."
MEX_GOL_total_control:0 "Exert Total Control"
MEX_GOL_total_control_desc:0 "Every aspect, every facet, every single individual mote of our nation and its economy shall be entirely transferred to the control of the national government under Carrasco. Only through state planning and total nationalization can our nation truly live up to its maximum potential. Privatization and private enterprise that preys upon the weak will be a thing of the past, as will be cancerous communization and collectivization programs such as the failed Ejidos. In their place, total state ownership shall succeed where these past experiments failed."
MEX_GOL_eternal_war_economy:0 "The Eternal War Economy"
MEX_GOL_eternal_war_economy_desc:0 "War is inevitable. From the Flower Wars and the apocalyptic war with the Spanish that ruined our old empire to the revolutions of modernity and like our fiery coup, war has proven to be an eternal and never-ending reality for Mexico. We shall embrace this fate and transform our economy into one fueled entirely and eternally by war and militarization. With war proving to be life’s only constant, there is no way this could fail as we mold Mexico into a nation that holds martial prowess and militarization above all."
MEX_GOL_return_of_the_old:0 "Return of the Old"
MEX_GOL_return_of_the_old_desc:0 "Under Tlatoani [MEX.getleader], the visage of colonial Mexico has been entirely eradicated. By reviving our pre-colonial heritage and harkening back to former glories, we have done away with the shame of colonialism and Hispanic culture, replacing it with something far more purely ‘Mexican.’ Our new state stands as the heirs of the Mexica - a new Aztec Empire for all the world to behold. As our allies, foes, and other foreigners all tremble before our awe-inspiring culture and might, our people shall stand proud and strong, finally free of past disgraces and missteps. Under our new leader, our modern Tlatoani, we shall triumph and finally reach prosperity!"

MEX_GOL_continue_the_persecution:0 "Continue Anti-Calles Persecution"
MEX_GOL_continue_the_persecution_desc:0 "Plutarco Calles and his band of Totalist banditos have terrorized the Mexican people and sullied our national identity for far too long. The past Socialist government took some small steps to diffuse his influence, but we shall go further. Calles and his followers are a cancer - nothing more - and we shall remove this cancer from our nation so that our newly purified Mexico can finally heal."
MEX_GOL_eliminate_socialist_leaders:0 "Eliminate Socialist Leaders"
MEX_GOL_eliminate_socialist_leaders_desc:0 "Even though Zapata lies in a shallow grave and Calles and his followers being utterly annihilated, Socialism is still a threat to our regime. Socialist bandits and revolutionaries under the command of fools like the infamous Pancho Villa must be destroyed along with their social democratic and liberal allies so that our Mexico can become truly pure and wholly devoted to our new direction. We shall undo the damages of the Mexican Revolution and eradicate the so-called ‘victors’ until all of Mexico is safe."
MEX_GOL_kick_the_beaten_corpse:0 "Kick the Beaten Corpse"
MEX_GOL_kick_the_beaten_corpse_desc:0 "Even with our newfound and reinvigorated push to rout Syndicalism and Socialism entirely from our state, the demonic filth that is Leftist thought continues to infect the nation. Though the Mexican Left has largely been reduced to a rotting, decaying corpse, this corpse is still capable of spreading its plague to the masses. We must burn this rancid mass and finally free Mexico from the siren’s call of Socialism."

MEX_GOL_old_guard_victorious:0 "Garza’s Old Guard Triumphant"
MEX_GOL_old_guard_victorious_desc:0 "Through smart tactics and harsh measures of suppression, Roque González Garza has crushed Carrasco’s chances to lead our new Mexico, and has consolidated his hold over the ARM and the wider nation at large. Infamous for his harsh atheist principles, his hands-off approach to economics, and his rabid nationalist tendencies, Garza is expected to drive Mexico to a new future cemented in a modernized and purified Mexican national identity, free of any past failures and influences."
MEX_GOL_ally_the_landlords:0 "Ally the Landlords"
MEX_GOL_ally_the_landlords_desc:0 "The landlord class underpinned the rule of Porfirio and proved to be a great thorn in the side of the revolutionary government, especially with Zapata’s regime and his push for using the Ejido system. With the foul Reds routed from the nation, the landlords are now open to negotiations, and with their vast wealth and power, they would prove to be a valuable ally. We shall work with the landlord class and utilize their expertise to form a strong foundation for our new indirectly controlled economy."
MEX_GOL_bring_corporations_in:0 "Bring Corporations In"
MEX_GOL_bring_corporations_in_desc:0 "The various corporate bodies within Mexico ranging from century old distilleries such as Jose Cuervo and Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma to industrial giants such as Cemento Cruz Azul, Cemex, and Peñoles must be coerced to work for the greater benefit of the wider nation. We must work with these captains of industry and titans of profit in order to steer our growing economy under a Corporatist structure. With their expertise, our economy shall flourish as we use the profits levied from these corporations to fuel national development that is not already constructed by the corporations themselves."
MEX_GOL_indirect_control:0 "Take an Indirect Approach"
MEX_GOL_indirect_control_desc:0 "Generalissimo Garza’s belief that a hands-off approach to our economic development would be best for the nation and our people has proven to be quite effective. Notions of wealth equality, interventionism, and safety nets in the form of welfare are laughable, and these trivial and naive desires have melted away, giving way to pure and unadulterated profit and development. On the backs of corporations, land owners, and other economic titans, our newly reforged economy has brought prosperity and untold riches to our nation. We shall only continue to allow our economy to bloom without need for our meddling, for only with ample space and room to grow naturally can our economy flourish."
MEX_GOL_mexican_nationalism:0 "Proliferate ‘Nacionalismo Mexicano’"
MEX_GOL_mexican_nationalism_desc:0 "Mexico is the greatest nation on the planet! Though we have lost our way in the past, falling subject to foreigners and radicals, our newly reforged state has cast off these failures and replaced them with a budding air of national chauvinism and rightfully-earned supremacism. Ideas of Mexican nationalism and exceptionalism have spread like wildfire under the watch of the ARM, fueled by these rabid patriots and their ringleader - our beloved national father Roque Garza."
MEX_GOL_national_revival:0 "Renacimiento Nacional Mexicano"
MEX_GOL_national_revival_desc:0 "From the ashes caused by the Revolution and our subsequent coups, a new Mexican national identity has been born like a pure and noble phoenix. Riding the wave of rising national fervor, our nation, our culture, and our very people have been renewed and enkindled in a purified and proud concept of national Mexican exceptionalism. True patriotism and pure Mexican culture have come to dominate the national scene, and soon all of Mexico shall be touched by this ‘Mexican National Renaissance.’"
MEX_GOL_arm_supremacy:0 "Ensure ARM Supremacy"
MEX_GOL_arm_supremacy_desc:0 "The ARM, or Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista, was once just a mere nationalist paramilitary, but has since risen to become the dominant political movement in Mexico. Now formally a political party, these Gold Shirts have saved the nation from Socialist and Liberal plagues that would infect the minds of our helpless people. Luckily, the ARM has stood as a bastion against these sinful viruses and have stalwartly defended our new regime without faltering. These heroes must be elevated above their fellow man as champions and protectors of our new Mexican nation, giving them free reign to secure the nation and rule it as they see fit. With Garza guiding them and the wider country, we know we cannot fail!"
MEX_GOL_secularize:0 "Secularization at Any Cost"
MEX_GOL_secularize_desc:0 "Religion is a cancer, though one so deeply ingrained in Mexican culture that removing it and its influence is no simple feat. At the end of this beast is the Catholic Church, which has dominated our nation for centuries since the arrival of the first Spanish colonists. The first step in eradicating this disease and the vermin spirituality breeds is to formally and legally separate Church and State in perpetuity. The Church, no matter the branch or sect, shall have no say in Mexico any longer!"
MEX_GOL_ban_practice:0 "Ban All Religious Practice"
MEX_GOL_ban_practice_desc:0 "With Church and State finally and totally separate - at least on paper - the time has now come to take our strive for anti-theism another step farther. Religious congregation and public practice are to be fully banned within the state, limiting even simple prayer to be a private affair done preferably in shame within our peoples’ own homes. Though still far from total atheism, and with great pushback expected, we are still far from being free from religion, but Mexico inches ever closer to atheistic paradise."
MEX_GOL_state_atheism:0 "The Bliss of State Atheism"
MEX_GOL_state_atheism_desc:0 "With Secularism established and heavily enforced, and with prayer and worship now limited only to private residences, total state atheism can be fully declared. Enforced by our ARM paramilitaries and our loyal police and military forces, Mexico shall be fully divorced from Theism of any kind. Rational thought, Secularism, and anti-theism now fill the minds of the masses, breaking the spell of that accursed ‘opiate.’ Our new state shall be free of the lie of divinity, and focus to build a great and noble empire here on the material plane."
MEX_GOL_the_new_order:0 "A New Order"
MEX_GOL_the_new_order_desc:0 "Free from religion, supported by a new national identity, and bolstered by a flourishing economy, the new Mexican state under our beloved Generalissimo Roque González Garza has become a beacon of purity and prosperity for the world to bear witness to. Standing on its own, free of foreign influence and vile ideologies, Mexico has survived endless war and achieved the gleaming future our people have always deserved. This new order is unparalleled on the world stage, for no nation can match the might and splendor of [tag.getname], and no nation ever will!"

MEX_ITG_the_new_monarchy_desc:0 "With the Gold Shirts of Garza and Carrasco now thwarted, and with an agreement being drafted between José Antonio Urquiza and his Synarchists and José Vasconcelos and Salavador Abascal’s Integralists, it would seem that monarchism shall be brought back to Mexico. Not seen since the time of Maximilian I de Iturbide in 1867, it is finally time for us to return to our God guided monarchist path. However, this new monarchy shall be different from those of the past, guided by new ideologies and deepened experiences. Now all that is left to decide is which of our two constituent parties shall rise as the heralds of the restored Crown."

MEX_ITG_a_nationalist_monarchy:0 "A Nationalist Monarchy"
MEX_ITG_a_nationalist_monarchy_desc:0 "With the bulk of the surviving hierarchy of the Alianza Antisocialista siding with José Antonio Urquiza and his Unión Nacional Sinarquista, the time has come to fuse Synarchism and Monarchism into one, unified whole. Though neither Urquiza’s vision or the Synarchist dream originally had any monarchist aspirations, by cooperating with the Integralists and by implementing our own ideas, we shall tailor-make a monarchist system to form-fit our new Mexico and its realities."
MEX_ITG_military_support:0 "Support from Radical Military Elements"
MEX_ITG_military_support_desc:0 "The armed forces of Mexico are rife with soldiers and officers holding reactionary, traditionalist, conservative, or otherwise anti-Liberal and anti-Socialist stances.

All political parties across the nation shall be officially abolished and banned, though the government will still be dominated by a Synarcho-Integralist ‘organ’ that fills the bureaucracy and halls of the legislature while aiding Abascal and the regime. By rising above party politics, our government shall work as one cohesive whole."
MEX_A_Catholic_Nation:0 "A Purely Catholic Nation"
MEX_A_Catholic_Nation_desc:0 "The Catholic Church must be elevated to become the main unifying organization of the state. Long has the Church been a loyal ally to the Mexican people, and long have they been an integral part of our society, identity, and traditions. We must continue this centuries-old relationship, deepening connections with the Vatican and the Papacy as we build up the local Catholic Church of Mexico and utilize it to unify the masses under our regime."

MEX_The_Teacher:0 "The Teacher"
MEX_The_Teacher_desc:0 "The beloved Cultural Caudillo, José Vasconcelos Calderón is one of the most influential and divisive figures in modern Mexican history. Regardless of this mixed reputation, he is still respected and beloved by millions and this national figure has risen alongside his Partido Integralista Nacional to dominate the remnants of the AAS and the wider Mexican nation. Pushing for his concept of a unified cosmic hispanic race, the proliferation of Integralist thought and Mexican culture, and dedicated to bringing true meritocracy to our new state, Vasconcelos shall lead Mexico into its bright new dawn."
MEX_Entrench_Integralist_Thought:0 "Entrench Integralist Thought"
MEX_Entrench_Integralist_Thought_desc:0 "As the main face behind the Mexican Integralist movement, José Vasconcelos is wholly dedicated to entrenching this foreign ideology and thoroughly adapting it to fit our unique conditions. By building an organic, corporatist state supported by his unique racial concept of ‘la Raza Cósmica’ - an idea that establishes the mixed peoples of Latin America as their own distinct and syncretic ‘cosmic’ race formed and protected without resorting to violent Social Darwinist or racialist attitudes -, Vasconcelos hopes to bring about a new golden age for the Mexican people and our culture. Tailored Mexican Integralism will be cemented into the foundations of the state, and la Raza shall be ushered into a new promised land."
MEX_Old_Friends_in_High_Places:0 "Old Friends in High Places"
MEX_Old_Friends_in_High_Places_desc:0 "Vasconcelos once enjoyed far broader support during the time of Obregón’s regime back in 1924, but perhaps it is not too late to win these old friends back. With his renewed position of power and respect, there are few rational minds that would openly reject an invitation from Vasconcelos, and we should use this to our advantage. We shall recall these old friends to return to the aid of their old ally, giving them positions in the Vasconcelos regime as loyal stooges. This shall provide greater stability as Vasconcelos’ pool of potential enemies shrinks while his power only increases, and the experience of these veterans of the Mexican political scene should prove to be a boon to our regime."
MEX_An_Educated_Government:0 "An Enlightened Government"
MEX_An_Educated_Government_desc:0 "Vasconcelos is a firm believer in the idea of meritocracy - or a society that promotes and elevates those up the societal hierarchy if and only if they prove to be a useful and loyal arm of the state. Those that contribute more shall be rewarded more, and those that have the expertise, talent, ability, or good sense to aid the state shall be given all that we can give in return. Only by elevating the best of the best can we create an expert, effective, and efficient Mexican state that truly meets the needs of its loyal citizens while remaining steadfast in the face of any foe."

MEX_The_Firebrand:0 "The Firebrand"
MEX_The_Firebrand_desc:0 "José Antonio Urquiza has risen above his rivals and the overwhelming influence of the Integralist bloc in order to dominate the AAS and become the new strongman of Mexico. As the herald of Synarchism and the founder and leader of the Unión Nacional Sinarquista, Urquiza will usher in this strange, new, and ambitious ideology to become the new foundation of our reforged Mexican state. A fanatic Catholic, a vitriolic firebrand, a devoted National Syndicalist and Synarchist, and one of the loudest voices in the Mexican Right, José Antonio Urquiza is expected to blaze a new trail ahead into Mexico’s uncertain but prosperous destiny."
MEX_Our_Hero:0 "Our Hero Urquiza"
MEX_Our_Hero_desc:0 "In order to solidify his position as the new strongman of Mexico, José Antonio Urquiza has begun to foster the creation of a cult of personality centered around his image. With state propaganda campaigns and a shackled media apparatus promoting Urquiza and his ideas and party around the clock, with the Catholic Church supporting him as the new Defender of the Catholic Faith in Mexico, and with the bulk of the Synarcho-Integralist coalition that controls the under-government supporting him either voluntarily or under threat of force, there is no escaping the imposing visage of Urquiza. Urquiza is Mexico, and Mexico is Urquiza!"
MEX_Renewed_Synarchism:0 "Renewed Synarchism"
MEX_Renewed_Synarchism_desc:0 "Synarchism is almost alien to the Mexican people, for it is a relatively young ideology that got its formal birth in our nation only a few short years ago. Urquiza is aware of this fact, and he and his Unión Nacional Sinarquista have begun promoting this new ideology throughout the country. Synarchism will come to dominate every aspect of Mexican life, for it has already dominated both the AAS and the wider government. All will come to embrace this new uniquely-Mexican school of thought - a tailor-made ideology form-fitted to perfectly conform with true Mexican society."
MEX_First_of_its_Kind:0 "The First of its Kind"
MEX_First_of_its_Kind_desc:0 "Mexico is the first nation on Earth to now put the ideas of Synarchism into practice - a noble and pious political experiment unlike the world has ever seen. While we are alone in this world, we are not weak, for our Synarchist foundation brings us strength and resolve above all others. Mexico shall stand as a beacon to other foreign states, tempting their governments or their masses to embrace the one, true school of thought - Synarchism. We shall be the heralds of a new wave of political thought and evolution, and it is all thanks to Urquiza!"

God has heard your prayers! The Empress María Gizela Josefa Erna Isabela de Iturbide, astride her army of fanatical patriots, has returned to claim her family's throne in the name of the forsaken of Mexico! Mourning the loss of her beloved mother and elder sister, the newly crowned María III shall avenge the loss of our once-rightful Empress and heir while guiding Mexico into its new pious and somber dawn. Praise be to Almighty God! And woe to the vanquished! ¡Viva Mexico!"
MEX_our_lady_of_mercy:0 "Our Lady of Mercy"
MEX_our_lady_of_mercy_desc:0 "The House of Iturbide, much like the Habsburgs, has always been a pious family, and one intertwined with the history of Catholicism. With Maria Gizela's return to her throne - a Habsburg through ancestral adoption and an Iturbide through blood, it is time we strengthened the ties between her dual family line and the Church. We shall bind the name and lineage of the royal family with a new Mexican-Catholic doctrine, making her right to absolute rule not only tradition, but positively divine."

It is through Her embrace - this haunting yet noble and enrapturing visage of divine death - that Mexico stands redeemed, and it is time that She received her due. With Her influence now spread throughout the Empire, we shall formally incorporate Santa Muerte and her teachings into our new religious autocracy."
MEX_the_cathar_reformation:0 "The Cathar Reformation"
MEX_the_cathar_reformation_desc:0 "It was the Occitanians of France that introduced the concept of gender equality into the Christian ethos. The Cathars of old preached that the soul has no gender and believed that any form of gender discrimination, including that of the Vatican, was immoral and undivine. This doctrine shall prove to be our salvation, serving as the impetus to bring true equality to the state. It is in their name that we shall enforce cooperation and fairness between the sexes, ending the curse of sexism over the Mexican people so that we may build a paradise together."

The new Mexican Empire owes its brothers in Vienna an eternal debt that it could never repay.

She brought with her the great teachings of high society in the high courts of Vienna, influences from the heartland of old Latin society, and a glimpse at the storied, age-old cultures of the great powers of Europe. With these ideas and influences in mind, by Her Majesty's will Mexico will be metamorphosed into a paradisiacal haven of moral opulence, divine culture, and an enriched assortment of fantastical arts - all uniquely Mexican but inspired by our Latin-derived European heritage."

The Empress has decided to use this new social order as a bulwark for building Mexico's future.

It is by God's will and by María’s hand that these injustices shall finally end. The Empress wills that the people of our great Empire be housed, clothed, and fed in the name of good Christian charity and piety so that they may never experience hardship again! With these basic necessities cared for and with their worries allowed to drift to other matters, our people shall finally be able to flourish in God’s new chosen land."

Our new pious paradise shall be the envy of the Western World, and a beacon of Godliness, good governance, and enlightened royalty to all across the globe - especially to the downtrodden and the oppressed.

Toledano offers everything the Mexican people have needed for so long, providing us safety, representation, prosperity, national respect, and so much more, and all he needs from us is loyalty. He shall give the world and more to Mexico without asking for anything as collateral but our undying devotion to our Red savior. He asks not for adulation or a cult of personality, for he simply desires absolute loyalty from those he risks his life to protect - all we have to say in return is ‘Si, Comandante!’"

He offers this hand to all true proletarian patriots in our new Mexican state, for under his watch, Mexico will no longer be an infamous den of dirty peasants and dry, poor backwater settlements - now is the dawning of the new age for the Mexican people, one where they are free from the prison of poverty and history of destructive violence that has ensnared them for centuries.

This beautiful land however, is also vastly underdeveloped and under industrialized despite its size, important location, and the abundance in natural and mineral wealth within its wilds. We must do away with the frontier culture many in Sonora have come to expect, and bring Mexican modernity to this hinterland.

We shall tear down the Catholic Church as an institution here in Mexico, but we shall not cut ties with the Faith entirely, for State Atheism would only serve to anger and rouse the true believers against us. Instead, we shall co-opt it for our own uses, raising new red and crimson cathedrals across the nation and allowing religious practice within these walls. Here, in state-run and party-monitored environments, we can foster a refined version of Proletarian Catholicism - one that fulfills the masses while also indoctrinating them with our true ideology and surveying them as we look out for dissidents.

It seems however, that time has played its sneaky tricks, and now we find ourselves in the position to become the main super power of North America as the Yanquis continue their decline. We shall rewrite our history with the gringos soon as our Mexico rises to surpass everything their foul Union ever achieved. Our place in the shadow of the ‘Americans’ is finally at an end!"

MEX_PCM_the_heir_to_karl_marx_desc:0 "Comandante Vicente Toledano has brought true Marxism to Mexico. Under Toledano’s stewardship, the wilds of this land have been tamed and developed, the Proletariat rejoice as they are truly free for the first time ever, and both socioeconomic and cultural prosperity have been ushered in like never before. As the true Heir to Karl Marx and Frederich Engels, Vicente Toledano has created a Communist utopia centered around Mexico City, shining as a beacon for the whole world to bear witness to. As the Lenin of the West and the heir to Communism’s largest figures and founding fathers, a great legacy has been carried on by Toledano, and a great burden is upon his shoulders. He is the vanguard of Communism in the New World, and the prophet of America's red dawn. With our new Mexican proletarian state shining as a pristine paradise for all the world to behold, soon all shall follow in our righteous example!"

MEX_constitutional_convention_desc:0 "With our constitution drafted and the framework of our new republican system established, the time has come to hold Mexico's first fair and free democratic elections. In just a few short weeks, votes will be counted and the first party to lead the nation shall be inaugurated, setting the nation on the path towards our new destiny as decreed by the masses. No longer shall autocracy, authoritarianism, or corrupt Socialist ‘democracy’ plague our nation or our people, for finally Mexico is free to choose its own path."

MEX_prun:0 "Partido Revolucionario de Unificación Nacional"
MEX_prun_desc:0 "The reactionary Partido Revolucionario de Unificación Nacional - or the Revolutionary Party of National Unification - has come out triumphant in our recent democratic elections. Notable for their hard anti-radical stance, militarist attitudes, corporatist economics, and innate distrust of the very democratic system that has ushered in their victory, PRUN is set to solidify Mexico as a stalwart and strong, if authoritarian, conservative republic. No longer shall the diseases of Liberalism and Socialism stain our proud history and handicap our prosperous destiny!"
MEX_pan:0 "Partido Acción Nacional"
MEX_pan_desc:0 "After a tight race, the Partido Acción Nacional - or the National Action Party - has been elected as our republic’s new ruling party. As devout in their Catholic faith as they are in their hatred for Socialism and Synarchism, these pious protectionists seek to bring a privatized and protected capitalist economy to our Mexico - one that puts the needs of our nation first over foreign business interests. With the Church on their side and with new agricultural reforms poised to win over the people, PAN shall lead the nation into a prosperous and pious future!"
MEX_plc:0 "Partido Liberal Constitucionalista"
MEX_plc_desc:0 "With silver tongues and golden promises, the Partido Liberal Constitucionalista - or the Liberal Constitutionalist Party - has won the elections. Standing as the middle ground of Mexican republican politics, these capitalists and captains of industry have one vision for Mexico: profit. Espousing free trade and free market economics, immense agricultural reform to win over the peasantry, and a monumental industrial build-up to as if it were time for a second industrial revolution, these devoted liberals shall use the media and their economic know-how to transform Mexico into a profitable beacon of modern liberal capitalist."
MEX_pri:0 "Partido Constitucional Progresista"
MEX_pri_desc:0 "Champions of social progress and industrial might, the Partido Constitucional Progresista - or the Progressive Constitutionalist Party - has won the elections. Standing against Socialism and decidedly Liberal, yet also pushing for a Mexican welfare state, these progressives seek to bring a fair and free democracy and interventionist economics to our state. Through rapid industrialization, the creation of socio-economic safety-nets, and through the enshrinement of civil liberties and human rights in law and legislation shall transform Mexico into a shining liberal beacon in this dark world."
MEX_plm:0 "Partido Laborista Mexicano"
MEX_plm_desc:0 "A shimmering pink pearl standing for true social democracy and a de-radicalized Left, the Partido Laborista Mexicano - or the Mexican Laborist Party - has won our most recent elections. Championing social security, social reform, and social democracy, these pseudo-Socialists have endeavored to separate themselves from the dark stain that surrounds the Mexican Left. With partial nationalization and socialization of the economy and through working with the moderates left among the Left, the PLM shall guide Mexico into a fair, free, and equal future entirely safe from the horrors of radicals and reactionaries."

MEX_limited_liberties:0 "Limited Liberties"
MEX_limited_liberties_desc:0 "Although democracy has been brought to Mexico and has given power to our party, that does not mean we should trust it. Even now, vile Synarchists and perfidious Socialists stalk the nation, waiting for their moment to strike as they gnaw away at our republic’s foundations. We cannot afford to let these radical elements destroy all that we have achieved, and so civil liberties across the nation shall be leashed and tightened in order to prevent the spread of their plaguelike ideas. The press will be muzzled, unnecessary and dangerous rights such as free speech and assembly shall be eroded, and civil liberties as a whole shall be replaced with martial law. Mexico will have order, and it will be safe!"
MEX_military_support:0 "Support from a Loyal Military"
MEX_military_support_desc:0 "Because of the militaristic nature of the PRUN, the military is willing to neglect the laws that mandate that our armed forces be apolitical in order to quietly support their favored party. While this could cause future problems, especially if other parties are elected in the future or if this symbiotic relationship turns parasitic, it will help the PRUN far too much to pass up the opportunity. With the military at our side, the PRUN will entrench its hold over our nation’s defenders as well as our position in the government and the reach of our rule."
MEX_electoring_monitoring:0 "Democratic Watchdogs and Electoral Monitoring"
MEX_electoring_monitoring_desc:0 "Our natural distrust of the very democratic system that brought us to power is only rational, for the dangers of letting everyone have a say in government is all too real. With radicals and extremists threatening our republic, and with coup attempts so fresh in our memory, it is paramount that all future elections are to be checked for fraud and tampering. Election monitoring, poll watching, and invasive democratic watchdogs shall loom over every vote, and if this just so happens to improve our own chances at winning future re-elections, then so be it."
MEX_reactionary_thought:0 "Embrace Reactionary Thought"
MEX_reactionary_thought_desc:0 "Mexico is the most glorious nation on this Earth! For too long has it wallowed in Socialist filth and Liberal foolishness. We need to make Mexico great again, for corrosive reforms and liberalization measures only serve to weaken our nation and our position, and the only way to do that is to embrace all that makes us truly ‘Mexican.’ Liberal excesses and radical perversions shall be wiped away from the state as we emphasize our proud tradition, cultural heritage, and stoic past."
MEX_propaganda_campaign:0 "State-Run Propaganda Campaigns"
MEX_propaganda_campaign_desc:0 "Now that the PRUN firmly controls the nation, we need to secure our position as the most powerful and most beloved party in Mexico! Using funding and staff from the state, we will start a propaganda campaign to make sure every voting Mexican in the country knows we are the best choice for their futures. From newspapers and pasted fliers to radio and government initiatives, we shall reach every heart and mind in Mexico with our message."
MEX_laissezfaire_economy:0 "A Corporatist Economy"
MEX_laissezfaire_economy_desc:0 "With the foundations of our new republic laid and with the PRUN firmly in control of the nation’s destiny, the time has to enact their planned economic reformation program. Calling for a Corporatist system to serve as the framework of our new economic system, big businesses and corporate units made up of agricultural, laborer, martial, and scientific groups shall come to dominate Mexico’s financial system. With their organized expertise and sheer-size now behind our economic destiny, Mexico shall surely rise to a new prosperous age of profit and progress."
MEX_red_scare:0 "El Temor Rojo"
MEX_red_scare_desc:0 "The Socialists that stalk our nation want nothing more than to destroy us and the noble republic we have built! We need to make sure all true Mexicans know that these vile Reds are no allies or friends, but instead they are wolves in sheep’s clothing waiting for their moment to pounce. In order to win over the masses and show them the truth, a statewide campaign of terror against Socialism in all its forms shall be organized in order to scare our populace into fearing the Red Devil and learning the truth. With the people properly educated on Socialism’s vile influence and on our side, we shall work towards the total eradication of Leftist thought in Mexico."
MEX_destroy_synarchists:0 "Eradicate Radical Nationalism"
MEX_destroy_synarchists_desc:0 "Perverted forms of noble Nationalism, such as Integralism, Synarchism, and the filth spewed by the AAS, are putrid and sickening ideologies far too closely attached to vaguely-Lefitst economic principles, anticlericalist attitudes, and/or radical ideas that corrupt the Catholic faith. However, they are also dying ideologies that have slowly lost the vast majority of their support bases. These sick and dying schools of thought just need the last nail to be hammered into their coffins in order to make sure these deluded extremists are never a threat to this country, and never sully our pure form of patriotic nationalism, ever again."
MEX_destroy_reds:0 "Rout the Reds"
MEX_destroy_reds_desc:0 "Now that the republic is mostly secure, nearly free of radicalism and its dangerous temptations, it is finally time to deal a final blow to the radical Left. Though these forces proliferated and flourished following the Mexican Revolution, they have grown decadent, corrupt, and traitorous. With the last of their numbers still alive either rotting in jail or hiding out in sun-blasted caves, we shall scour the nation completely of these miscreants. All radical Leftists now already allowed within our democracy shall be brought before a jury or the sword. Mexico is of God, not of Marx!"
MEX_support_the_church:0 "Deepen Ties to the Church"
MEX_support_the_church_desc:0 "Now that the Socialists have been ousted and true democracy reigns, we need to help the Church to rebuild itself after the repression they were victim to under the Socialist administration. By aiding this holy Catholic institution, we will not only gain the support of devout Catholics across the nation, but also place a great debt upon the Church that they will have to repay. Above all however, it is our duty as the truly faithful to repair and rebuild God’s own Earthly tether and aid His clergy and flock."
MEX_catholic_identity:0 "A Pious Catholic Identity"
MEX_catholic_identity_desc:0 "For centuries, Catholicism has been an integral part of Mexican culture and identity. Long before our independence from Spain, we were a devout Catholic nation, and this pious heritage was only recently robbed from us during the Mexican Revolution. Roman Catholicism shall be enshrined as the official faith of the state, and the atheist policies of the former regime shall be completely torn down and reversed. Mexican culture is Catholic by nature, and that is what it always shall be!"
MEX_protectionist_economy:0 "Economic Protectionism"
MEX_protectionist_economy_desc:0 "Though our economic activities on the world stage are important, our resources and the profitability of our own domestic markets are even more so. We need to protect our economy from foreign interests and vultures by becoming independent and self-sufficient like the thunderous economies of the USA, Germany, or the combined powers of the Entente. Only through protectionist practices that benefit our own above the foreign, such as strong tariffs and import quotas, can true prosperity be attained."
MEX_privatization:0 "Mass Privatization"
MEX_privatization_desc:0 "Now that fair and free democracy has been ushered in and the old Socialist regime has been uprooted, we can finally begin to undo their nationalization efforts by selling off business, industry, and other slices of our economic infrastructure to the people. Finally, those with sound business sense, and the resources and know-how to efficiently utilize these economic sectors, will be allowed to prove it, granted they can afford the upfront cost. Privatized capitalism shall once again be ushered into Mexico!"
MEX_end_the_ejido_system:0 "End the Ejido System"
MEX_end_the_ejido_system_desc:0 "The Ejido system - a system of communal agricultural cooperatives created in the wake of the Mexican Revolution and massively expanded under the Zapata presidency - is a very flawed system. It would be far more practical to re-privatize the agricultural sector and allow farmers and businesses to work their own parcels of farmland as before. We shall uproot this final legacy of the Revolutionary government and free Mexico’s farming system from the vices of Socialism."
MEX_new_ranches:0 "New Ranches for a New Mexico"
MEX_new_ranches_desc:0 "A vast majority of the old ranchero class have come to our government with an enticing proposal. They have offered to voluntarily give up the Ejido system - for it was never too popular with the farmer majority anyway - and have offered voting support to our party as a solid bloc, if our administration were to fund a series of new, modernized ranches to be built across the nation. The hope is that this move will mobilize our agricultural sector en masse by placating our farmer class while giving them the tools to efficiently feed the nation and build more profitable, larger producing farms and ranches."
MEX_neoliberalism:0 "Classical Liberalism"
MEX_neoliberalism_desc:0 "The new Liberal era in Mexico can finally begin with our election, and it is our duty to bring about this new golden age for our people. Under the PLC, free market Capitalism, open civil liberties, economic freedom, and cultural liberalism shall finally be peacefully ushered into our Republic. With the ideas of John Locke, David Ricardo, and José María Luis Mora now forming the basis of our new administration, the people of Mexico shall finally know true freedom, liberty, profitability, and prosperity!"
MEX_media_support:0 "Charm the Media Apparatus"
MEX_media_support_desc:0 "The (mostly) Liberal-minded media certainly played their role in our election, and with our long-standing cooperative relationship being what it is, we should move to ‘officially’ tie ourselves to this powerful tool of public manipulation. With underhanded deals and backroom talks, we shall wed the Mexican media apparatus to our administration, effectively creating our own ‘Liberal’ propaganda machine on the back of graft, political favors, and bribery. With the media under our sway, the PLC shall become the darling of the public’s eye while our new allies demonize our rivals and expose our enemies with the blinding light of journalism. Though they won’t always be reporting the whole truth, it is for the best to maintain stability - and our rule."
MEX_free_market_economy:0 "The Freer the Market..."
MEX_free_market_economy_desc:0 "...the freer the people! Only through a free, unfettered market can our economy be truly fair and thrive. Without governmental intervention or unnecessary amounts of red-tape or oversight, our financial system and industrial sectors will be able to flourish and pump out profit and goods like never before. Only through a truly free market can all of Mexico and its people follow suit."
MEX_invest_in_the_industry:0 "Expand Commercial Industries"
MEX_invest_in_the_industry_desc:0 "We need to invest in our civilian industry in order to jumpstart our faltering economy, for the Revolution and the government that followed did nothing but wreak havoc on our once-profitable system. Though this will be far from complete handouts, it will provide the step-up our commercial business and industries need in order to function once more and start turning a profit."
MEX_invest_in_heavy_industry:0 "Domestic Heavy Industry Plans"
MEX_invest_in_heavy_industry_desc:0 "The military is as important to the nation as it is expensive to maintain. However, it must be done lest our armed forces fall even further behind the times. In order to ensure our martial prowess and readiness for war, military industry shall be expanded across the nation and reformed to be more efficient. Only with a strong, modernized, and well-supplied military industrial complex can Mexican democracy truly be safe."
MEX_mexico_industrialized:0 "The Industrious Mexican Miracle"
MEX_mexico_industrialized_desc:0 "Though our reforms are far from over, they have already begun to pay dividends. All around the nation, the black smog of progress fills the air as more factories and refineries spark their furnaces for the first time. An economic miracle on a scale not seen since the Industrial Revolution has blossomed here in Mexico, and only through continuing this mass industrialization push can we truly continue to profit and progress into a profitable modernity."
MEX_progressive_thought:0 "Truly Progressive Thought"
MEX_progressive_thought_desc:0 "Progressivism is a relatively new idea to our republic - a fine medium between radical Leftist reforms and the slow, hollow promises of Liberalism. Regardless, progressive thought must be spread and expanded to form the basis of our society’s values. No longer can reactionary and conservative beliefs force our nation and our people into the muddy mire of the past. Only through progressivism can we truly progress into our destined future!"
MEX_civil_liberties:0 "Expand and Enshrine Civil Liberties"
MEX_civil_liberties_desc:0 "Protecting civil liberties is one of the most important duties of fair, progressive democracy. That is why our administration is to put our utmost effort in making sure civil liberties are respected and greatly expanded by enshrining them into law through legislation while protecting them at all costs through sharp governance and with an able, loyal police force. From freedom of speech to freedom of religion, all innate rights of man shall be upheld by the state without deviation."
MEX_interventionist_economy:0 "Promote Economic Interventionism"
MEX_interventionist_economy_desc:0 "The economy is like a river - every so often its natural course must be corrected and altered in order to promote optimal flow. We must enshrine this interventionist principle into the foundations of our administration, interfering in the economic process when it is called for in order to promote optimal levels of fairness and competition so that productivity and profitability remain as high as possible without trampling the masses under unnecessary greed."
MEX_secure_democracy:0 "Secure and Safeguard Pure Democracy"
MEX_secure_democracy_desc:0 "Now that elections have been held and democracy has truly risen, we need to make sure no coup or revolution ever endangers our infantile democracy ever again. Unbiased electoral watchdogs shall be created to ensure a fair and free democratic process, while our military and police institutions shall be cleansed of their political leanings so that they may rise to become true, unbiased, and apolitical arms of the republic. Democracy is a noble institution, and our new regime shall work to uphold it, no matter the outcome of any fair vote."
MEX_social_security:0 "The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social"
MEX_social_security_desc:0 "Every citizen of our republic needs to know that the state has their back when things get hard. We shall create a welfare apparatus that acts as a safety net supporting all true citizens of Mexico, based on similar systems in America and Europe. In order to organize and administer this new system, the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - or the Mexican Institute of Social Security - shall rise to take care of the people who need it most, as they need it."
MEX_universal_healthcare:0 "Universal Healthcare for All Mexicans"
MEX_universal_healthcare_desc:0 "Taking our new social security program one step further, we have moved to bring ‘free’ universal healthcare to all Mexican citizens. Healthcare, like the social security program, shall be paid through the taxes already levied against our people, and private companies will no longer be allowed to profit off the pain and misery of the masses. With this system in place, we can focus on steady and stable population growth free from fears of an ineffectual or overstretched private healthcare system dropping the ball on our citizens when they need it most."
MEX_social_democracy:0 "Deradicalized Social Democracy"
MEX_social_democracy_desc:0 "As we distance ourselves from the other, more radical Leftist parties, we must ensure that we do not compromise on our vision simply to appease our detractors. Mexico’s destiny is that of Social Democracy - a socially-responsible and welfare-supported capitalist economic system paired with a fair, free, and progressive Democratic form of governance. This fusion of Liberal and Leftist policies shall serve Mexico greatly - standing one foot in the future and one foot in the Revolutionary past. We shall undo the mistakes of the former Socialist government while upholding the few things they did right, all without falling prey to radicalism."
MEX_moderate_the_left:0 "Moderate the Left"
MEX_moderate_the_left_desc:0 "As more and more Socialists, Syndicalists, Anarchists, and other Leftist radicals jump ship from their failing parties and join in with our PLM, we need to publicly and loudly re-proclaim the moderate stances of our party. Though radicals may move into our ranks, the core vision of the PLM will never waver! We are firmly a party of Social Democracy and pro-Labor policies - a far cry from the radical Socialism of the Revolutionary government that preceded our republic and various parties that supported them. Radicalism and extremism have no place in our modern Mexico!"
MEX_moderate_socialist_economy:0 "The Pink Pearl of the Americas"
MEX_moderate_socialist_economy_desc:0 "Though we have implemented varying Socialist, Progressive, and Laborist policies, our nation is still Capitalist - at least in part. We have proven that a fusion of Capitalism and Socialism is not only possible, but profitable. With a mix of privatization and nationalization, our economy and our people have thrived like never before. Our Mexican Republic shines as a pink pearl of Social Capitalistic excess - a luminous beacon in a dark world."
MEX_meet_with_the_pna:0 "Cooperate with the PNA"
MEX_meet_with_the_pna_desc:0 "The PNA - the Partido Nacional Agrarista -  is the largest Socialist party of any kind in Mexico. Long have they dominated Leftist thought and the wider Leftist movement in the nation, but their big-tent approach means their vast body is open to being poached. We shall work with both party leaders above the table and disillusioned individual ministers under the table in order to draw as much of the PNA into our ranks. Given we are the reformist solution, many of their revolutionary-minded radicals find our vision irreconcilable, but we are sure we can win over the bulk of their party to our cause, in time."
MEX_meet_with_the_pmt:0 "Break Bread with the PPS"
MEX_meet_with_the_pmt_desc:0 "The PPS - the Partido Popular Socialista - is the largest Syndicalist party in the nation. Given their position playing second-fiddle to the PNA of Zapata for so long, they are eager to throw off his reputation and work with our government. We will reach out to these moderate Syndicalists and Laborists, incorporating some of their least radical ideas into our legislation while their members join our ranks."
MEX_meet_with_the_pnr:0 "Defang the PNR"
MEX_meet_with_the_pnr_desc:0 "The PNR - the Partido Nacional Revolucionario - may be the smallest of the three main Socialist parties in the nation, but they are also the most infamous, the most radical, and the most violent. In an effort to prevent these overzealous extremists from destroying our nation from within, we shall move to hold diplomatic talks between our ranks in order to placate their most violent urges. Though we may receive some heat from the other parties for talking with the PNR, hopefully it will be worth it if we can simply earn their begrudging support - even if just among their more moderate members."

MEX_second_election:0 "The Second Free Mexican Elections"
MEX_second_election_desc:0 "With our republic surviving the term of our first fairly elected executive, democracy has well and truly flourished in our new republican state. As the next elections come and go, a new administration shall rise to take the place of the old stewards of democracy, and all Mexicans shall bear witness to the noble democratic process. Though far from perfect, our republican system is the best hope for our nation and our people, so may it last in perpetuity for many terms to come!"

MEX_PRUN_second_term:0 "Second Term of the PRUN"
MEX_PRUN_second_term_desc:0 "With the ever-untrustworthy machinations of democracy playing out once again in yet another election cycle, our Partido Revolucionario de Unificación Nacional has once again come out on top. With our mandate secured democratically twice now, we are free to rule this republic as we see fit, with little opposition able to stand in our way. Under our assured rule, conservatism, militarism, and non-radical nationalist fervor shall flourish as our corporatist economy continues to turn a great profit for the nation."
MEX_Integrate_PARM:0 "Absorb the PARM"
MEX_Integrate_PARM_desc:0 "The Partido Auténtico de la Revolución Nacional is a militaristic nationalist party largely composed of veterans, soldiers, military staff, and other like-minded conservatives that has been barred from democratic elections within the nation in order to promote the supposed apolitical nature of the armed forces. However, their ranks may find a kindred soul in our PRUN, which holds dear many of the same beliefs and policies. We shall move to absorb the majority of the PARM to both bolster our support base and to guarantee our protection while further entrenching our party’s ties to the military apparatus."
MEX_Almazans_Populism:0 " Almazan's Populism"
MEX_Almazans_Populism_desc:0 "Juan Andreu Almazán is one of the most influential and respected names within the party, and though he may not lead us anymore, his politics still deeply influence our policy. His ideas on implementing expansive conservative populism to win over the masses has proven popular within the party, and with our democratic mandate enshrined, we are free to pursue his more radically populist economics in order to bring fair profit to all Mexicans. Sheltered and supported by the state and by the PRUN, our populace surely can’t fail!"

MEX_PAN_second_term:0 "Second Term of the PAN"
MEX_PAN_second_term_desc:0 "Secured now twice by democratic process, the mandate of our Partido Acción Nacional has been upheld despite our many foes. By choice of the people, our Catholic heritage and staunch anti-radicalism shall continue unopposed while our protectionist approach to economics proceeds with wavering. Through privatized capitalism and agricultural reform, we have once again won over the masses, and now we shall make good on our electoral promises. Mexico’s stance as a proud Conservative, Capitalist, and Catholic nation shall continue under the guidance of the PAN!"
MEX_Integrate_Catholic_Youth:0 "Integrate Catholic Youth"
MEX_Integrate_Catholic_Youth_desc:0 "Across the nation, there exists numerous Catholic and Christian youth groups, student associations, and other organizations eager to aid the PAN and our regime. We shall incorporate these pious youths into the official PAN hierarchy as the new youth wing of the party. Here at our side, they shall help soften our public image while providing an easy breeding ground to proliferate our ideas, ensuring a reliable voter base and platform to reach the national youth for generations to come."
MEX_Christian_Democracy:0 "Pure and Pious Christian Democracy"
MEX_Christian_Democracy_desc:0 "Incorporating ideas of Social Catholic Teachings, traditional Christian values, and other pious philosophies into both our legislation and the very structure of the party and nation shall ensure that our democracy does not stray from God’s chosen path for the Mexican people. This syncretic system of conservative Catholic stances on moral, social, and cultural issues that takes a more socially-informed stance on economic and labor issues is surely what our people need to survive and thrive in this blessed, pure republic, and with our mandate secured, there is no one to stop us."

MEX_PLC_second_term:0 "Second Term of the PLC"
MEX_PLC_second_term_desc:0 "Standing as the bastion of Liberalism in Mexico and once again defending our democratic mandate, the Partido Liberal Constitucionalista has been chosen yet again by the masses to lead our democracy. Professing classical liberalism, unrestricted capitalism, and immense agricultural and industrial reforms, this economics-focused party has won over the masses with its delivered promises of profit and prosperity. With their second term now confirmed, Mexico shall truly be ushered into its new Liberal age."
MEX_Embrace_Maderos_Image:0 "Embrace Madero's Image"
MEX_Embrace_Maderos_Image_desc:0 "Perhaps the most famous and greatest Liberal of our age, the late former-President Francisco Ignacio Madero González is a hero to Mexican democracy and liberalism. A champion of civil liberties, capitalist reform, and social justice, Madero embodied everything the modern PLC professes. We shall glue ourselves to his noble, beloved image and raise Madero as the national hero he should be recognized as by all. Following his plans for the nation and by masking ourselves behind his legacy, we shall enshrine our position as the heralds of Mexico’s proud Liberal renaissance."
MEX_Rebrand_Liberalism:0 "Rebrand Mexican Liberalism"
MEX_Rebrand_Liberalism_desc:0 "Liberalism has been slandered and defaced by Mexican regimes for decades, sullying our image and our platform. We must repair the image of Liberalism in the eyes of the masses, and the only way to do so is with popular reforms and profit-making policies. Only by making good on our promises to bring modernity and prosperity to the Mexican people can we truly rebrand our image."

MEX_PCP_second_term:0 "Second Term of the PCP"
MEX_PCP_second_term_desc:0 "Supported by popular mandate, the Partido Constitucional Progresista has yet again secured the right to rule our republic. As champions of progressivism and industrialization, the PCP shall continue their push to create a true, fair, and Liberal Mexican interventionist welfare state without falling prey to the radicalism that has come to infect the PLM, and without the self-serving hunger for profit of the PLC. As the defenders of the common man, the PCP shall utilize their hard-won popularity to continue to transform Mexico into a profitable, fair, and safeguarded Capitalist republic."
MEX_The_Revolution_Fulfilled:0 "The Revolution Fulfilled"
MEX_The_Revolution_Fulfilled_desc:0 "Though the Mexican Revolution eventually was a failure, with Zapata’s regime being overthrown violently, the ideals of this honorable conflict have not died out. Instead, they have found a home here in the PCP. Though we are not nearly as radical as Zapata, our party aligns well with the views of the initial victors of the conflict under Álvaro Obregón. Though Obregón’s PLM radicalized in his absence, our PCP has stayed true to these less-extreme ideas. We shall be the heralds of this Progressive agenda, and under our rule, the Revolution shall finally be proven successful."
MEX_The_Peoples_Liberalism:0 " The People's Liberalism"
MEX_The_Peoples_Liberalism_desc:0 "Our PCP has transformed what it means to be Liberal. We have modified Liberalism to fit our needs and, far more importantly, the needs of our people. This populist form of Liberalism has come to dominate Mexican politics as a palatable, less extreme middleground between Socialist and mainline Liberal politics, for both have become to be viewed as predatory and opportunistic. With civil liberties enshrined, a welfare state established, and a new modernized culture sweeping the nation, we have utilized this ‘People’s Liberalism’ to transform our republic, and to metamorphose the Mexican masses into a prosperous and modern people like never seen before."

MEX_PLM_second_term:0 "Second Term of the PLM"
MEX_PLM_second_term_desc:0 "After stealing support from the radical Left while winning over the Mexican masses with popular reforms, the Partido Laborista Mexicano has seemingly proven that moderate Socialism and Laborist policy truly is the way to bring Leftist politics into Mexico without obstacles. By denying the revolutionary tendencies of the wider Left and by strictly adhering to their syncretic Social Democratic principles, the PLM has come to secure yet another term through fair republican elections. With the masses at their backs and the wider Left throwing in their support, the PLM has become a dominant bloc, ensuring their victory for many terms to come."

MEX_Integrate_the_Red_Militias_desc:0 "Throughout the countryside and across the hinterlands, Socialist militias still organize and convene to act against our republic - both peacefully and violently depending on the group. In order to bolster the dominance of the PLM while providing another additional arm of security to the republic, we shall move to integrate these militias into our regime as the official militant arm of the party. This shall allow us to by-pass the restrictions calling for an apolitical armed forces, while giving our party a loyal defense force - a necessary act in many of our ministers’ eyes given the reactionary tendencies and conservative sympathies of our armed forces."
MEX_Mexican_Laborism:0 "Mexican Laborism"
MEX_Mexican_Laborism_desc:0 "True democratic Laborism has been introduced to our republic. This small taste of Socialist policy has proven to be very popular among the masses, granting our industrial, agricultural, and unskilled labor force the protections, incentives, and rights they need to thrive and survive in our modern republic. Never shall the simple laborers - the backbone of our very nation - be trampled underfoot by their government ever again. Pro-labor and moderate Socialist policies are the way of Mexico’s future, and the people of our republic best prepare for the peaceful advent of this semi-Socialist system, for it is the only future Mexico needs."

In order to ensure the sanctity and safety of our democracy, all far-left parties, from radical groups like the PPS, PMT, and PNR, to more moderate groups like the PLM and PNA, shall be barred from all future national and local elections.

MEX_no_bans_desc:0 "Despite our preconceived biases and political leanings, we cannot jeopardize fair and free democracy simply by banning our detractors and rivals from running against us. We must prove on the political stage that we are the right choice for Mexico, and it shall be up to the people to see through the lies and siren songs of the radical Left and Right to our professed truths. Only with true competition and ample choice can fair and free pluralist democracy truly thrive."
MEX_ban_authoritarian_parties:0 "Ban Reactionary Parties"
MEX_ban_authoritarian_parties_desc:0 "As the wheels of democracy continue to turn, we must take precaution over the rising strength and influence of the reactionary Right. These authoritarians and nationalist extremists have no place in our modern Mexican republic. To preserve and safeguard our democracy, far-right parties such as PRUN and PARM, or the various groups within the AAS, shall be banned from running in future elections both on national and local level. Only then can the Mexican people finally be free of reactionary taint."
MEX_real_democracy:0 "Unfettered Mexican Democracy"
MEX_real_democracy_desc:0 "With the finalized framework of our republic coalescing as yet another democratic term runs its course, we have taken the necessary measures needed to ensure that a fair, free, and untampered republican process can flourish in our Mexico. Despite a history of violent coups and revolutions, our reforged democracy is hopefully here to stay. With the people’s voices finally being heard without meddling from outside sources or from paranoid, power-hungry parties, unfettered democracy has finally been ushered into our once-wild nation. Now, we look to the shining future as our democracy marches forwards in perpetuity, finally purified of corruption and self-serving ambitions, for for the first time in our history, the people of Mexico finally have all the say."
MEX_dominant_party_democracy:0 "A Dominant-Party Republic"
MEX_dominant_party_democracy_desc:0 "As we formalize the structure of our democracy for generations to come, we have taken precautions necessary to ensure the republic cares for the masses however necessary - even when the masses themselves do not know what is best for them. As elections are continuously held, one party - our party - shall come to dominate the republican system, whether through legitimate means or underhanded tactics. Despite this ‘betrayal’ of the supposedly fair democratic process, we shall ensure that the people’s voices are well and truly heard - we just will only listen to those voices that make sense or agree with our positions - for that is our duty as the democratic stewards of this noble, ‘fair’ republic."

Calles firmly believes that the way forward for Mexico is for him to seize total power over the nation, ushering in a set of reforms that will transform Mexico into a true revolutionary state, which he has dubbed 'The Maximato.' Under this Totalist state and Calles’ PNR, Mexico shall be guided into its new destiny as we shed our past and embrace our new Red future!"

MEX_new_economic_policy_desc:0 "Mexico's economic policies have changed very little in the last decade. We shall not stand for it any longer! Calles has decided to take our economy towards a new revolutionary height with his ‘New Economic Policy.’ This new system will bring a nationalized Socialist planned economy to Mexico supported by small amounts of Capitalism and private ownership in order to jumpstart our fledgling financial system."
MEX_peoples_factories:0 "People's Factories"
MEX_peoples_factories_desc:0 "We've had a mixed economy in our country since the Revolution, allowing private ownership of factories but enforcing several regulations and workers’ rights on the industrialists. However, Calles sees this as a corruption of our revolution, and has ordered us to begin a collectivisation process of the industry - save for the most vital industries which are to be nationalized, in order to truly allow the people to own the fruits of their labour and for peak efficiency and fairness to reign in our economy."
MEX_peoples_mines:0 "People's Mines"
MEX_peoples_mines_desc:0 "Like it happened with our industry, our mines were also mostly in the hands of private investors. These foreign capitalists shall profit from the exploitation of our workers no further, as we shall collectivise the mining operations across Mexico. The Proletariat of the Maximato shall own the means of production and the treasures of the earth beneath them."
MEX_control_ejidos:0 "Control the Ejidos"
MEX_control_ejidos_desc:0 "The Ejidos are by definition already a collectivised system of agricultural management, and we're very pleased with that. However, these Ejidos work independently, with goals that tend to differ from the good of all Mexicans. We shall bring all Ejidos of Mexico under our centralized control in order to coordinate their activities with the greater good of Mexico in mind."
MEX_by_crom:0 "Support CROM"
MEX_by_crom_desc:0 "The 'Confederacion Regional Obrera Mexicana' has been for a long time an ally of Calles.

Since the CGT stood with our enemies, we only stand to gain from this."
MEX_enforce_article_27:0 "Enforce Article 27"
MEX_enforce_article_27_desc:0 "Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution states that the property and the waters included within the national borders are property of the Nation and, as such, the Nation has the right of imposing dictates to private owners in order to defend Public Interests. With this justification, we shall finally nationalize oil fields in Mexico so that this vital black gold can be utilized to its full potential by the state and Calles."
MEX_calles_laws:0 "Ley Calles"
MEX_calles_laws_desc:0 "Officially, the 'Ley Calles' - or Calles Laws - will now be in effect with the goal of controlling and limiting Catholic worship in Mexico, as well as limiting the influence of the Catholic Church. These laws shall reduce the number of priests to one for each six thousand inhabitants, add the need for a state licence in order to serve as priest, and add the need to register at a local office where the preaching will take place. These heavy restrictions shall stange Catholicism and its vile, corrosive influences, slowly freeing Mexico from the grasp of this Opiate of the Masses."
MEX_socialist_education:0 "A Purely Socialist Education"
MEX_socialist_education_desc:0 "Mexico still has the old school system from before the revolution with only a few slight tweaks and reforms being pursued. This is not what Calles has envisioned for Mexico, and as such, he has ordered the nation to begin a major re-restructuring of our education system. All children of Mexico shall receive a state-mandated curriculum heavily steeped in Socialist thought and the tenets of the Maximato, ensuring loyal and dedicated citizens for generations to come."
MEX_state_atheism:0 "Total State Atheism"
MEX_state_atheism_desc:0 "Mexico shall not stand by as the reactionary religious clergy gnaws away at our foundations any longer! We shall revoke civil liberties from the clergy, including the right of trial by jury, outlaw certain religious orders that do not align with our views, and deprive them of property rights with the goal of creating a true atheist state. Secularism did not go far enough, for Mexico must be entirely divorced from religion in all its forms."
MEX_term_limits_rewrite:0 "Strengthen the Presidency"
MEX_term_limits_rewrite_desc:0 "The Presidency in Mexico is not much different from the Presidencies of other democracies - or at least, it is for now. This was an advantage in order to manage meager coalitions and pesky compromises within the sickly revolutionary democracy. However, Calles is a reformist and needs all the authority he can get in order to achieve his mighty ambitions for the Maximato. To that end, he has proposed a reform that allows the President to have untold amounts of executive power, effectively making Calles the most powerful man in the nation with no equal and little checks and balances on his grasp. Mexico shall be one with Calles, and Calles shall embody the new Mexico."
MEX_loyal_military:0 "A Loyal and Fanatical Military"
MEX_loyal_military_desc:0 "The reason for our success during the revolution was the disloyalty of military elements that switched sides to our cause. While back then that became very useful for our cause, nowadays we consider it a possible threat to our stability. With this in mind, we shall reward loyalty to our government in the military and punish dissenting officers, with demotions if necessary and with harsher tactics if our hand is so forced. With new training and ideological indoctrination measures, we shall transform the Mexican armed forces into a feverishly loyal and terrifyingly effective arm of the Maximato while ensuring their total dedication to Calles."
MEX_direccion_federal_de_seguridad:0 "Dirección Federal de Seguridad"
MEX_direccion_federal_de_seguridad_desc:0 "While we now enjoy the newfound loyalty of our armed forces, we need to create something to keep the civilian population and the military in check as well, just in case they change their minds and decide to overthrow us. To that end, we shall create a paramilitary force, the 'Dirección Federal de Seguridad,' which shall be under the direct command of our President. This paramilitary shall only answer to Calles, serving as his personal bodyguard, death squads, and secret service. Under their watch, even our army shall be kept in check as Calles builds a new Mexico atop a foundation of fear, strength, and intimidation."
MEX_lead_the_pnr:0 "Centralize the Apparatus of State"
MEX_lead_the_pnr_desc:0 "The 'Partido Nacional Revolucionario' is the party which currently supports Calles. However, Calles doesn't lead the PNR, and that has led to some heated arguments between him and other influential figures within the party. To solve this, we shall make Calles leader of the party, for after all, he is already the Head of State. There's no reason why he shouldn't be the head of the party that rules with him, and there is little stopping him if the PNR were foolish enough to refuse. With Calles at the helm of the party, he shall be free from any obstacle as he moves to centralize the state and greatly weaken federalism and the positions of his frequent rivals - the state governors - in order to consolidate power within the hands of the President."
MEX_political_commisars:0 "Political Commissars"
MEX_political_commisars_desc:0 "Now that our takeover is complete, we need to secure the loyalty of the army. Even if troops and officers assure us of their loyalty, we need a vanguard body to keep them in check in case they change their minds if and when we let our guard down. These commissars shall serve as a bridge between the party and the army, ensuring utmost loyalty and dedication to the Maximato within our ranks, on penalty of punishment or death."
MEX_control_congress:0 "Control Congress"
MEX_control_congress_desc:0 "The Congress in our country was meant to secure representation for our citizens. However, factionalism and petty squabbles have hindered reforms and led to an incapable, ineffectual, and near totally useless congress. Calles and the PNR shall take complete control of the congress, in order to help them 'solve' their differences and be able to pass our reforms without any further problems. Congress shall just become another tool of Calles, adding to his legitimate facade and enabling his rise to total power even more."
MEX_cult_of_personality:0 "The Personality Cult of El Jefe Máximo"
MEX_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "Plutarco Calles - or El Jefe Máximo as he likes to be called - has managed to consolidate his position and the position of his PNR, rising to become the undisputed leader of Mexico. His role in reforming Mexico into a new Totalist paradise cannot be debated either, for never has Mexico been so united, safe, and prosperous under such a capable strongman. We shall reward his wisdom and commitment to the greater Mexican good by instating a massive propaganda campaign to uphold his image. Calles’ face shall become the face of Mexico itself as our people and the state uplift El Jefe Máximo as the demigod of the Revolution he truly is."
MEX_purge_reactionary_thought:0 "Purge Reactionary Thought"
MEX_purge_reactionary_thought_desc:0 "Our country has had its progress delayed due to the traditionalist and reactionary culture of its people. Now that we have succeeded in transforming Mexico into a more modern and collectivist society, we now should focus on shaping the culture of future generations, so that these reactionary thoughts don't disrupt future progress. A new Mexican identity and culture shall be born - one free of the taint of Catholicism, conservatism, liberalism, reactionary nationalism, and other deluded false ideas - that supports and uplifts the ideas held dearly to El Jefe Máximo and his Maximato."
MEX_perfect_dictatorship:0 "La Dictadura Perfecta"
MEX_perfect_dictatorship_desc:0 "Calles has achieved what once seemed impossible: A dictatorship that is not only tolerated by the people, but even beloved by the common man. El Jefe Máximo is slowly but surely turning into a national figure that will inevitably be written down in the history books as a revolutionary reformist and true hero to Mexico. As the national father of our rebirthed nation, Plutarco Calles has created the perfect dictatorship, and shall now guide this stable ship into the unknown but bountiful waters of our new destiny!"

MEX_death_of_calles:0 "The Death of El Jefe"
MEX_death_of_calles_desc:0 "After a decade of heartbreak over the loss of his beloved Natalia and after the rigors of statecraft ground down his health and will, the beloved Plutarco Calles - our El Jefe Máximo - has finally given up the ghost. In the wake of his passing, a power vacuum has been cut open within the Maximato and the PNR, with Lázaro Cárdenas, Emilio Portes Gil, and Manuel Perez Treviño all jockeying for power and control over the party and the state. Only one can rise to take the place of El Jefe, and now all of Mexico waits for the day their new strongman will rise above the others to lead our nation into its new destiny."

MEX_President_Cardenas:0 "President Cárdenas"
MEX_President_Cardenas_desc:0 "Outmaneuvering the revisionist Gil and the fanatical Treviño, Lázaro Cárdenas now stands where Calles once stood, but it is not a position he intends to maintain. A divisive figure, Cárdenas both lauds Calles as a hero for saving the ideas of the Mexican Revolution from reactionary forces, but also frames him as a tragic villain that was consumed by his lust for power and his desire to save his nation, losing sight of what truly mattered - the wellbeing and will of the Mexican people. To right the wrongs of the past, Cárdenas has begun to dismantle the Maximato from within in order to return noble and free democracy to our people."
MEX_Dissolve_Congress:0 "Dissolve Calles’ Corrupt Congress"
MEX_Dissolve_Congress_desc:0 "Standing as President of the Maximato and with power consolidated within his own hands, Lázaro Cárdenas has begun the process of dismantling the Maximato from his seat of near-absolute power. Moving to dissolve the PNR-dominated congress in order to allow free elections, Cárdenas has announced his own candidacy in the revitalized Partido Laborista Mexicano for the coming elections, and now, thanks to our new President, Mexico once again marches towards fair, pure democracy."

MEX_President_Gil:0 "President Gil"
MEX_President_Gil_desc:0 "Rising past the naive Cárdenas and the loyalist Treviño, Emilio Portes Gil has taken Calles’ position as leader of the state. Despite his close relationship with Calles and his position within the upper echelon of PNR party leadership, Gil is a noted ‘revisionist,’ seen as a humanizing force within the Calles regime while still being devoted to the party line. As President of the Maximato, Gil is expected to uphold the image of Calles as a just and noble national father, wiping his darker deeds under the rug as he expands the power of the legislature and raises the whole PNR as the collective leadership of Mexico."
MEX_An_idealized_Calles:0 "An Idealized Calles"
MEX_An_idealized_Calles_desc:0 "Despite his extreme measures and proclivity to utilize force to get his way, Plutarco Calles - our beloved El Jefe - was a true Mexican patriot! By order of President Gil, the record of Calles’ more unscrupulous or less popular decisions and acts shall be wiped from the record so that future generations only know Calles as the perfect strongman he tried to be, instead of the flawed and multifaceted man he truly was. We do this to protect Mexico and to give our nation a national father to find pride in without raising him to any other-wordly status - transforming El Jefe into an earthly symbol for all of Mexico to rally behind. Though the PNR shall always know the truth, the people of Mexico will be spared from this reality, given an idealized El Jefe to always look up to."
MEX_Expand_the_Senates_Power:0 "Expand the Senate's Power"
MEX_Expand_the_Senates_Power_desc:0 "The legislative body of Mexico has withered under the domination of Calles and the PNR - a course that shall now be reversed by President Gil. Under Calles’ rightful successor, the senate shall be granted new powers as the position of the executive is eroded. However, the senate too is still largely dominated by the PNR, so in reality this will simply shift power from Gil - a lone member of the PNR - to the larger body of both the party and the government. This will humanize the face of our regime while bringing it token amounts of republican representation - a huge step for the once-totalitarian Maximato."
MEX_All_under_the_Party:0 "All Under the Party"
MEX_All_under_the_Party_desc:0 "As President Emilio Portes Gil slowly erodes his own position of power, the power of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario only grows. With each chip away at the position of the executive, Gil melds more and more into the wider body of the PNR, taking the spotlight off of himself as he marches the Maximato towards collective rulership. Under the command of our dominant and deeply entrenched party, Mexico shall benefit from the brilliant mind of not one strongman, but many, all unified and working in sync to do what is best for Mexico, our people, our party, and our future. With the party of Calles metamorphosing into a solid, insurmountable bloc like a revolutionary Totalist oligarchy, the Maximato shall enter a new age unlike anything seen before while the PNR rises to become the face of the nation."

MEX_President_Trevino:0 "President Treviño"
MEX_President_Trevino_desc:0 "Crushing the pathetic revisionists Gil and Cárdenas, Manuel Perez Treviño now holds Mexico in his palm as the new Calles. A devout loyalist to the late El Jefe Máximo, Treviño is expected to continue what Calles started by leading the PNR without deviation from his predecessor’s plan for Mexico. By elevating El Jefe to a position of national reverence that borders on worship and by further solidifying power within the hands of the executive, Treviño shall be Mexico’s new strongman - an honorable and steadfast replacement for our fallen Caudillo."
MEX_Our_Martyr:0 "Our Martyr"
MEX_Our_Martyr_desc:0 "Plutarco Calles was the greatest Mexican to ever live! He lived and died for our sins so that Mexico would be born anew under a pure and strong Maximato - the greatest form of government on this planet. El Jefe will never be forgotten, for he shall be elevated to a status fitting of his near-divinity. The spirit of El Jefe Máximo is the embodiment of the new Mexican national consciousness and of the true ideals of the Mexican Revolution; he shall be the perfect martyr to unify the state even further and to bond our Maximato like never before. Calles shall live on in eternity as the symbol of our new Mexican state - a nationalist icon for a nationalist Mexico!"
MEX_Curtail_the_Senates_Power:0 "Curtail the Senate's Power"
MEX_Curtail_the_Senates_Power_desc:0 "The legislature of Mexico has rotted as the Maximato has risen to greatness. Under Calles, the PNR dominated all branches of the government, strangling revolutionary representative democracy in order to preserve unity and to safeguard El Jefe’s vision for Mexico. With Calles gone, he left the task of fully crushing this naive system unfinished - a task it is now up to President Treviño to complete. The legislative and representational system of Mexico shall become fully and completely dominated by President Treviño and the PNR, for no longer will our Maximato be hindered by the naive pursuit of or reverence for democratic freedoms. With the senate out of the way, all power shall be free to flow into the hands of the PNR and the executive."
MEX_A_Supreme_Leader:0 "A Supreme Caudillo"
MEX_A_Supreme_Leader_desc:0 "El Jefe may be dead, but a new and capable Caudillo has risen to take his place. President Manuel Perez Treviño, now free from the shackles of political opposition, has now begun to amass all power of governance within his own hands. Rising to become a new breed of totalitarian autocrat, President Treviño is prepared to go to greater lengths than even Calles was to achieve total power. With all of Mexico in the palm of his hand, Treviño - the new Caudillo of the Maximato - has risen to become not only the most powerful man in the nation, but once of the most dominant politicians on Earth, for there are few nations on Earth that have allowed one man to hold as much power and influence over their own nation as President Treviño has. Under this new Supreme Leader, Mexico shall be safe as we safeguard the true Revolution and lead the Maximato into eternity."

MEX_union_laws:0 "Ley Federal de Trabajo"
MEX_union_laws_desc:0 "Currently, Mexico has rather old laws regarding work and working conditions. We shall enact a 'Federal Work Law' which specifies the individual's rights in the workplace, the labour conditions that can be put forward by companies to their employees, and the role of the state as a mediator in case these regulations are not fulfilled. These new laws shall protect the Mexican worker better than ever before, for the backbone of the nation must be supported and safeguarded at all costs."
MEX_urbanization:0 "Mass Urbanisation Program"
MEX_urbanization_desc:0 "The economic growth that our nation has experienced in the last few years has focused a lot of its economic buildup in the cities, which has in turned increased their population to the point they no longer can hold their populations while upholding social benefits, welfare, and services. We shall begin a program of urbanisation in order to expand the cities and their capacity with the benefit of our citizens in mind. Hopefully, this will improve their quality of life while also allowing our population to soar to new heights without sacrificing personal wellbeing."

With this in mind, we have to enact a national infrastructure act with the goal of improving logistics within our country, for after all, no one's going to do it for us. The Comisión Vial Revolucionaria Mexicana - or the Mexican Revolutionary Highway Commission - shall be created as a official bureau of the state, whose job it will be to lay lay down new state-financed roads across Mexico, finally connecting our disparate population centers to each other and to our vital military, industry, and agricultural sectors."
MEX_federalism:0 "Syndicalist Federalism"

Considering the changes in administration we have gone through since the end of the Revolution, it would be fair, and even beneficial, if we fulfilled their demands and granted them further funding, powers, and protections.

However, if we truly want to enter the modern age and fully apply the innovations our European brothers have made for Socialism, we have to begin a transition towards an industrialized society. Direct union democracy, collective bargaining, federalist principles, and other major tenants of Syndicalism shall come to fuse our democracy and our industry and unions into one syncretic whole dedicated to directly and truthfully representing the will of the unionized masses. The herald of this transition shall be President Toledano, and the foundation of it shall be Syndicalism!"

Though the Ejidos system still causes friction, many have begun to show signs of profitability and efficiency, so to further Socialize and Syndicalize our agri-industry, unions must be brought to our farmers and ranchers. Taking advantage of our momentum, we will create a national agricultural union - the 'Confederación Nacional Campesina' or 'CNC' - so that even the rights of the lowliest of farmers are secured in our country.

MEX_agrian_socialism:0 "Pure Agrarian Socialism"
MEX_agrian_socialism_desc:0 "Socialism since its inception has been a movement of the workers and the working class, which considered peasants as allies but not as equals. Mexican democracy proves that peasants can be as revolutionary as workers, and as such we shall stand as a beacon of a new kind of socialism to our European brothers to see. With workers and farmers working hand in hand for our reaffirmed republic, true agrarian democracy and socialism shall be brought to Mexico."

MEX_empower_the_peasents_desc:0 "Peasants have been the most oppressed class in Mexico since its inception, and now that their hero is in power, he shall now grant them a series of benefits and rights to improve their livelihood, as well as a better representation within the government. No longer shall Mexico’s peasants be subjected to an apathetic or suppressive government, for now they shall live under a government that truly supports and uplifts them as the revolutionary heroes they are."

MEX_tierra_y_libertad_desc:0 "The phrase 'Land and Freedom' was originally said by the Mexican anarchist Ricardo Flores Magón, and then adopted by Emiliano Zapata. While Zapata may no longer be in power, we shall uphold the ideals this phrase represents by guaranteeing our citizens with both arable land to work and freedom to live as they see fit. The ideals of Mexican Revolution are alive and well in Pancho Villa’s Mexico!"

MEX_social_democrat1_desc:0 "The 'Mexican Labour Party' has come out on top during the elections with Pascual Ortiz Rubio at the helm. Their promises of Democratic Socialism and the  return to ideas of De la Huerta and Obregon's moderate reforms have won over the populace. Now it shall be our turn to lead Mexico to a safer, more popular, and less radical future."
MEX_improve_workers_rights:0 "Enshrine Rights for Workers and Laborers"
MEX_improve_workers_rights_desc:0 "We shall begin a series of reforms in order to improve working class rights across society.

Only with a sufficiently protected working class will our workers perform at peak efficiency without compromising safety or loyalty."
MEX_improve_native_rights:0 "Improve Native Rights"
MEX_improve_native_rights_desc:0 "Natives in our country have not been treated with the utmost dignity ever since Mexico came to be a nation. We shall correct this mistake by improving their rights and granting greater autonomy to their communities. They shall also be allowed to learn their native language in formal schools and keep their native syncretic religions as long as they are kept in the privacy of their own homes and houses of worship. The revolution shall finally reach our native countrymen, for no man shall be left behind in our republic."
MEX_education_improvement:0 "Expand Educational Funding"
MEX_education_improvement_desc:0 "Mexico's education budget has always been a secondary priority when it came to national concerns, and as such literacy and educational attainment rates across Mexico have suffered. However, now that we are in power, we see the need to increase their funding in order to achieve a better Mexico and to ensure a more stable future. With our next generations in the steady hands of well-funded and qualified teachers, our future shall be assured."
MEX_moderate_land_reform:0 "Moderate Land Reform"
MEX_moderate_land_reform_desc:0 "While many were happy with Zapata's land reform, he expropriated some land that belonged to small landowners who still lived within their means and worked closely with their workers. We do not consider this a just move, yet we consider land reform necessary. So, we shall continue the land reform efforts while dialing back their severity and assuring certain landowners the right to keep some of the land they now possess if they live and work there while operating within Socialist principles."
MEX_union_support:0 "Garner Union Support"
MEX_union_support_desc:0 "Without the support of Mexico’s various unions, most of our reforms would just be symbolic and ineffectual. We shall try to win over a bigger pool of supporters in both the CGT and the CROM, hopefully allowing us to further our reforms with their joint support. Though many of the unions have deep radical ties, we should slowly be able to wear them down to cooperate with our regime for the good of all Mexico."
MEX_industralization:0 "Leashed Industrialization"
MEX_industralization_desc:0 "Mexico has been an agricultural nation for years, and as such we lag behind many other countries in the world in terms of industrial prosperity. We shall begin an industrialisation program, hopefully increasing our economic prosperity and allowing our country to grow to new heights. However, we must not go overboard with these new initiatives, for our foundations shall still largely be agricultural in nature, for that is the tradition of Mexico."
MEX_promote_trade:0 "Promote International Trade"
MEX_promote_trade_desc:0 "Ever since mankind's inception, prosperity and development has always been focused around trade and trade routes. Recognizing this basic fact, we have decided to encourage Mexican trade both inwards and outwards, with progress and profit in mind. By creating a humanizing face to the outside world, softening our harsh Socialist facade in the eyes of potential trade partners, and by building up our internal domestic trade networks, we shall bring newfound wealth into our coffers."
MEX_social_welfare:0 "New School Building Initiative"
MEX_social_welfare_desc:0 "We have increased our education budget, but throwing money at the illiteracy problem is not going to solve it. Many rural towns in our country have enough teachers but are forced to study in great houses or in the open while dealing with limited supplies. We stand to improve this as we shall begin funding the construction of new schools throughout Mexico, each with the most up-to-date educational equipment and aides money can buy. Only then will we finally banish illiteracy from Mexico."
MEX_mexican_socialism:0 "Mexican Democratic Socialism"
MEX_mexican_socialism_desc:0 "Mexican society is complex; there are plenty of both conservative and progressive towns and groups that wish to help one another despite their differences to build a better nation, but are both afraid of retaliation from either opposing group, and from retaliation from an angry regime. As such, we don't have the conventional 'class struggle' that the Socialists in Europe have. With this reality in mind, we shall strive to create our own version of Socialism - one that can adapt to the realities that Mexican society faces - in order to bring true Socialist democracy to our revolutionary republic."
MEX_strengthen_congress:0 "Strengthen and Democratize Congress"
MEX_strengthen_congress_desc:0 "Presidents have largely commanded the destiny of Mexico for decades, but if we truly want to be a modern democratic nation, then we should strive to create a pure representative congress that can provide the changes that the people ask for while preventing the creation of autocrats and strongmen executives. We shall empower our congress to do just that, so we can truly embrace the democratic concepts that we fought and won the Mexican Revolution to achieve."

The ideals of the Mexican Revolution have been upheld and brought to fruition, and now the masses rejoice for their voices are well and truly heard. Though we are still only just beginning on our journey into Socialis, we do so with hope in our hearts and with the peace of mind that our Mexican democracy is well and truly safe.

With a party policy seeking to balance our agrarian past with our industrialized future, the PLM hopes to guide Mexico into the land of balanced, moderated, and non-radical Socialism while adhering strictly to mainline democracy. Now, only time will tell if this pink rose of Social Democracy flourishes or finally wilts under the pressure of statehood."
MEX_Balance_Agrarianism_Industralization:0 "Balance Agrarianism and Industrialization"
MEX_Balance_Agrarianism_Industralization_desc:0 "In order for Mexico to well and truly prosper, an equal balance must be struck between our competing economic sectors. The rising tide of industrialization is important, but it mustn’t suffocate our long-standing agrarian industry. Both sectors must be expanded, modernized, and made more efficient without one rising in importance or in attention over the other. Only with these two halves in sync can our Mexico truly prosper and reach modernity."
MEX_The_Pink_Rose:0 "The Pink Rose Blossoms"
MEX_The_Pink_Rose_desc:0 "From a revolutionary seed into a blossoming pink rosebush, our Mexican democracy has been through much peril and tribulations, but we have come out on top, unwilted and flourishing like never before. Moderate Socialism has been brought to Mexico by democratic referendums of her people, and it is here to stay. Our republic is a shining pink beacon to the world proving that non-radical Socialism truly is the way to lasting peace and prosperity. We have achieved our initial reforms and goals, and have brought freedom, liberty, and prosperity to the Mexican people, and though this has just been a first step, our foundations are secure. This pink rose has firmly planted root, and no force of reactionary thought or corruption shall uproot this beautiful bloom."

Expected to further expand the Ejido system of collective farming and to solidify Mexico as a truly agrarian nation, the PNA has their mandate, and now it is time they put it into action. Under their watch, the farmers, ranchers, and wider peasantry of Mexico - our very society’s backbone - shall find the prosperity they deserve."
MEX_entrench_Ejido_System:0 "Entrench the Ejido System"
MEX_entrench_Ejido_System_desc:0 "The collective farming system known as the Ejidos must come to fully dominate our agricultural system. The Ejidos have increased agricultural efficiency, have a better return on investment each season for our farmers, and have fostered cooperation between our workers while increasing output, at least after the growing pains of such drastic reorganization has passed. The legacy of Zapata shall be continued as the Ejido system is fully entrenched into our society. Collectivized farming is the future, and the PNA shall be our guide to this agrarian destiny."
MEX_Our_Bright_Fields:0 "Our Bright Fields"
MEX_Our_Bright_Fields_desc:0 "These golden fields before us go on for untold miles as they glisten in the sunlight, reflecting the sun’s rays as well as the rays of hope from the masses of Mexico. These masses hope for prosperity and freedom, for liberty and a peaceful future. For generations, they have waited on these empty hopes and dreams under oppressive regime after oppressive regime, but all that has been undone with the birth of our republic. Now, with the aid of the PNA, the masses of Mexico have planted these hopes in the ground and nurtured them until they became reality, growing both new verdant fields and a new prosperous society that upholds our traditions without falling prey to the mistakes or inefficiencies of the past. These bright fields are our past, our present, and our future, and as long as they continue to glisten in the sun each harvest season, Mexico and its people shall be alright."

MEX_syndie_second_term_desc:0 "The Partido Popular Socialista has secured another term democratic term, and now seek to further drive Mexico towards their fusion of Mexican Socialism and Syndicalism. Under the PPS, Mexico shall march towards total unionization as the workers and laborers of Mexico are finally uplifted and given the representation and welfare they have long deserved. With their union allies in the CTM, Mexico shall cast off all reactionary thought, capitalist notions, and predatory policy to become the Proletarian Republic our people deserve."
MEX_Unite_All_Unions:0 "Unite All Unions Under the CTM"
MEX_Unite_All_Unions_desc:0 "In order to better organize the various unions of our growing Syndicalist system, the Confederación de Trabajadores de México shall be created. This confederation of labor unions shall stand as one of the main pillars of the PPS’ rule, allowing the party to better organize and administer the growing sea of unions that has come to fill the nation. With all voices, all representatives, and all unions flowing into one main body, we shall ride into our Socialist destiny without fail."
MEX_The_Woker_Base:0 "A Proud Proletariat"
MEX_The_Woker_Base_desc:0 "The worker base of our Mexican republic has been uplifted! Finally, their voices can all be heard, and each has a representative that carries these voices to the ears of those in power. A near-perfect representative Red democracy has been formed here on their backs, with our prosperity being the fruit of their labors and hardships. These heroes of Mexico shall finally be given the recognition, the respect, and the benefits they deserve, for they are the lifeblood of our very nation. Without this solid backbone of trusted, uplifted, and proud proletarians, our journey towards true Syndicalism and Socialist utopia would surely collapse into dust. Mexico is finally a nation of, by, and for its workers."

We will bleed the Federales dry and smash aside their bickering radicals in order to secure the lands we lost almost a century ago. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the Mexican Cession, and the Texas Revolution shall all be avenged!"
MEX_California:0 "The March to Alta California"
MEX_California_desc:0 "With our first foray across the border and into American land being successfully and with part of the North secured, it is time for the second stage of the Reconquista to begin! We now march West and North to retake the true crown jewel of the West Coast - Alta California. We will not be stopped from reclaiming our destiny! Viva Mexico!"
MEX_Texas:0 "Cross the Rio Grande"
MEX_Texas_desc:0 "As we successfully perform our first crossings into Yanqui territory, the time to undo the Texas Revolution and the American integration of Texas is finally at hand. With this next phase of the Reconquista now in motion, we shall cross the Rio Grande and march into El Paso and beyond, crushing any resistance in our wake as we move to reclaim our rightful clay!"
MEX_WCC:0 "Take Back New Mexico"
MEX_WCC_desc:0 "The Western Command Center lies to the North - lording over our rightful clay that is Santa Fe de Nuevo México. They sit exposed, with their soft underbelly directly pointed at our armed forces. We shall march into the beautiful, arid lands of Nuevo México and take back the ‘American Southwest’ for our own people, finally undoing the vile Cession of 1848!"
MEX_Reorganize_The_North:0 "Reorganize the North"
MEX_Reorganize_The_North_desc:0 "Much has changed in the Old North since we left in 1848. People, cities, infrastructure - everything is nearly unrecognizable. However, reintegrating the North this will surely be no challenge for our strong and united Mexico, for we have already gone through the rigors of multiculturalism and thus have the experience to know how to handle the Yanquis and all the trouble they will bring. We shall tame this northern expanse just as we tamed the wilds of Mexico, and the gringos shall be brought to heel."
MEX_Women:0 "Our Policy on Yanqui Women"
MEX_Women_desc:0 "The laws on women differ between our nation and the former United States - differences that will have to be rectified in this new status quo we find ourselves in. Whether it be on their right to own property, their right to vote, or whatever else, the rights and laws of the Northern women will have to be hashed out and legislated or de-legislated to fit the needs and expectations of their new nation - our Mexico."
MEX_Religion:0 "The Status of Anglo Religions"
MEX_Religion_desc:0 "As with so many other Northern cultural elements that have come into question following the Reconquista, the largely Protestant religions of the North have now come to the forefront of the debate. One wrong decision or misstep, and we might have given the gringos another reason to take up arms against us, so we must delicately approach this situation lest these heretical Yanquis get uppity."
MEX_Language:0 "The Language Question"
MEX_Language_desc:0 "Mexico may have a multicultural and multilingual past, but the fact remains that the new Northerners speak in a tongue that is foreign from our own. As such, they are mostly free to conspire against us. Some hardliners claim we should introduce harsher sanctions on the English language, while their critics claim it will turn the Yanquis even further against us. We need to solve this debate and fast to set us on our course of integration."
MEX_Hollywood:0 "What to do with Tinseltown?"
MEX_Hollywood_desc:0 "The heart of the American film industry - the decadent and infamous Hollywood - has now come under our control. An economic paradise and cultural beacon as well as a den of debauchery and sin, Hollywood is one of our most division acquisitions in the Reconquista, with just as many calling for it to be burned to the ground as there are people calling for us to repurpose it for our own uses. As part of our larger reorganization of the Northern Territories, we have to decide what to do with it."
MEX_Alamo:0 "The Alamo Question"
MEX_Alamo_desc:0 "With Tejas now in the possession of its rightful owners, the old Misión San Antonio de Valero, or Misión de Álamo, has returned to our hands. For us, the Alamo is a symbol of perverted Holy ground, national humiliation, and wretched treason. However, for the Anglo-Texans, it persists as an enduring symbol of freedom. The question now stands; do we leave it be, or do we tear it down?"
MEX_Natives:0 "Our Stance on the Northern Natives"
MEX_Natives_desc:0 "The retaken territories in the North contain a lot of Native Americans, from the Navajo and Pueblo to the Commanche and Mojave, who have all now come under our control. However, some of these Amerindians are resentful of being under yet another foreign country, while others are instead thankful we have liberated them from Yanqui oppression. We, however, still aren't sure how to properly deal with them - a debate we must now work out."
MEX_Secret_Police:0 "Establish the Guardia Fronterizo"
MEX_Secret_Police_desc:0 "In order to quell the Anglo Rebellion, the Intelligence Ministry has proposed the establishment of a new secret police, in order to disrupt their activities and break up the seperatist Anglo cells. Such an agency will not only turn the tide against the rebellion, but it will also give any other internal subverters and Yanqui terrorists pause the next time they think about raiding our settlements. On the surface, they shall don the mask of the ‘Guardia Fronterizo de la Reconquista Mexicana’ - or the Border Guard of the Mexican Reconquest - a normal government agency dedicated to border safety. However, under the surface they shall operate above the law as the state’s own secret police who will wage an underground war against Anglo rebels in service of the nation."
MEX_Vigilantees:0 "Recruit Vigilantes"
MEX_Vigilantees_desc:0 "Perhaps the solution to end the Anglo Rebellion is not establishing a secret police after all, for such a move would likely only anger the Yanquis and sow more distrust within our nation. Instead, our eyes turn to an alternate proposal; namely, recruit loyal Tejanos, Amerindians, and just about any other volunteer into vigilante gangs. These volunteer brigades shall be used as an informal and independently organized arm of the state who shall utilize their own methods to handle the Yaunqui menace while keeping our own hands clean. We shall fight these bandits and rebels with bandidos and rebels of our own."
MEX_End_The_Rebellion:0 "An End to the Yanqui Rebellion"
MEX_End_The_Rebellion_desc:0 "We have taken the necessary measures, and the tide of the rebellion has been turned. It is time to end this uprising once and for all. The losses of 1845, 1846, and 1848 have all been avenged - Mexico is finally whole once more, and with our new policies and ordinances, the gringo menace is nothing but a distant memory. After our final death blow has been dealt, Mexico will be truly safe and secure, restored to its former territorial glory. Peace has nearly been brought to the expansive and wild North, and now the Mexican eagle soars from California to the Yucatan, reborn like a phoenix from the ashes and ready to face its new future head on!"
MEX_Looking_Outwards:0 "Looking Outwards and Onwards"
MEX_Looking_Outwards_desc:0 "With the lands of the Reconquista restored both to our hands and to order, and with our internal troubles dealt with and our economy improving, it is finally time to properly take a look at Mexico's status on the world stage and for ways to improve our international position.

### Events - start up ###

mexico.1.t:0 "The Golden Eagle of the South"
mexico.1.d:0 "Mexico’s history is long, rich, and exceedingly diverse, but has been plagued by one main invariable and nearly unending reality - War. Whether it be against America in 1845 or against itself in 1857, Mexico’s history has been defined by rival thinkers and ambitious idealogues launching war after war and revolt after revolt in fleeting attempts at imposing their own form of government on the rest of the country. This atmosphere of unabated conflict momentarily ended with the rise of Porfirio Díaz, who secured power by appeasing both Conservatives and Liberals across the nation, leading Mexico through an age of unparalleled modernization and advancement, but also an age of inequality and intense social strife. \n\nLike all dictators though, he wasn’t eternal and was deposed in 1911 in a mostly bloodless revolution, but his followers didn’t stay idle, and they would attempt to restore the old dictatorship, with Victoriano Huerta leading a counter-coup in 1913. This move threw the country into the throes of a real civil war, and thus the Mexican Revolution fully began. \n\nAmid the chaos and ever-shifting web of deals and alliances, three main sides coalesced: the populist alliance of Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata, the constitutionalist clique of Venustiano Carranza and Álvaro Obregón, and finally the “Porfirist” camp led by Victoriano Huerta and Manuel Mondragón."
mexico.1.a:0 "Then what happened?"

mexico.1200.t:0 "A New Year Dawns for the Southern Eagle"
mexico.1200.d:0 "After years of intense fighting, Victoriano Huerta and his alliance were defeated in 1915, even though peace seemed impossible for a moment as the American intervention and their landing in Veracruz led to a short ceasefire between most factions to kick the Yankees out. With Huerta deposed, a conference was called by the Populists, who invited the Constitutionalists to form a new United Government. Despite their overtures however, Venustiano Carranza would reject the offer. Soon after, Álvaro Obregon defected from Carranza’s clique when he was shown possibly-falsified evidence by an officer that Carranza planned to have him assassinated. After this defection, Carranza was left with virtually no allies, and was swiftly defeated by 1916. However, President Woodrow Wilson of the United States, deciding that Carranza was better than the “Socialists” in the Populist army, sent weapons and troops to Carranza’s stronghold in Veracruz while also making small expeditions into the nation through the border. This new gringo intervention led to tensions and even more defections within Carranza’s camp as information about this deal began to leak to the wider public. Finally, in 1920, Pablo González Garza assassinated Carranza and defected to the camp of the now elected President Álvaro Obregón, finally ending the Mexican Revolution. \n\nThankfully, Obregon was able to form a United government by supporting Pancho Villa’s governorship of Chihuahua and by appointing Emiliano Zapata as Secretary of Agriculture, and after two successive presidents since the revolution hailing from Obregon’s PLM (those being Francisco R. Serrano and Luis N. Morones), Zapata and his PNA were elected in 1932. \n\nWhile he is broadly popular, Zapata’s election also led to the creation of the Alianza Antisocialista and the Liga Democrática, with both groups violently opposing his somewhat radical, Socialist views. With Zapata’s fourth year in office just beginning and with tensions rising across the nation, Mexico sits on a razor’s edge once more. Whether it will finally break the cycle of unending strife and warfare, or if it succumbs to its seemingly inescapable destiny once again is another question."
mexico.1200.a:0 "La Patria Es Primero!"

### Events - assassination and first elections ###

mexico.2.t:0 "An Assassin Strikes at Zapata!"
mexico.2.d:0 "Breaking news has struck Mexico City like lightning, for it would seem that disaster has befouled President Zapata’s address to the nation. While standing atop a stage, speaking from a lectern to a massive crowd of thousands before him that filled the Zócalo, a bone-chilling crack ripped through the air, silencing the crowd before a second crack sent Zapata toppling to ground. A lone gunman, hidden among the masses, fired two shots at the President from less than 30 feet away - an embarrassment to his security detail of Constitutional Guads. Even more embarrassing, in the ensuing panic, it would seem that the assassin escaped without a trace, which will certainly have to be dealt with later. As the news of this horrid attack spreads throughout the nation like a thunderous wave, the wounded Zapata has been rushed off to the Iglesia y Hospital de Jesús Nazareno in order for doctors to attempt to save his life. With the nation still reeling from this horrid atrocity, the people weep while the opportunistic wolves circle, and many throughout the country now wonder what will become of the Tiger of the South."
mexico.2.a:0 "With the round missing vital organs, Zapata survives the attempt on his life."
mexico.2.b:0 "Dios mío! Zapata has been slain!"

mexico.3.t:0 "The Death of Zapata"
mexico.3.d:0 "Despite desperate attempts to save his life by our most skilled doctors, President and war hero Emiliano Zapata Salazar has been slain. The lone assassin that fired upon him has now become his murderer, and while the nation mourns, our government is organizing a nation-wide manhunt to catch his killer. With the sudden nature of this power vacuum, our regime had to act quickly to prevent total collapse. As such, our slain President’s brother and confidant Eufemio Zapata has risen as interim president. However, with his famous distaste for command and politics well known and evident, many can already predict that Eufemio will soon give up power to more capable, and more ambitious, hands. \n\nOnly two main groups in our government have any chance of being chosen by Eufemio to take control of the nation in this dire time. The front-runner of the race is Plutarco Calles - infamous political chameleon and party leader of the Totalist PNR. A known strongman and opportunistic authoritarian, Calles has been waiting for his chance to seize power. Opposing him are the power duo of Francisco ‘Pancho’ Villa - famed Revolutionary hero and Agrarian Socialist - and Vicente Lombardo Toldeano - one of the foremost Labor leaders in the nation - who together have promised to form a broad coalition government to oppose Calles’ influence. Both these two giants of the Mexican Left were loyal friends and allies to the late Zapata, and this friendship also extends to his brother, our interim President. However, the power and pressure of Calles erodes all bonds, even those of family and friendship, and many have begun to doubt Eufemio’s ability to resist Calles’ ambition."
mexico.3.a:0 "Plutarco Calles is appointed as interim President."
mexico.3.b:0 "Pancho Villa and Vicente Toledano form a coalition government."

mexico.300.t:0 "The Broad Coalition"
mexico.300.d:0 "In an attempt to resist the oppressive influence of Plutaro Calles and his PNR, Pancho Villa and Vicente Toledano have come together to head a broad coalition of all Leftists and Progressive parties in Mexico. With varying political groups from pink Liberals and Social Democrats to Orthodox Syndicalists and Agricultural Laborists coming together under a massive banner, chaos was inevitable from the start. Despite its noble intentions, the coalition is deteriorating fast, with even the veteran Pancho Villa and esteemed Vicente Toledano both struggling to keep the peace. Unless they can perform a diplomatic miracle and finally foster cooperation birthed from desperation and necessity, their pipedream of a coalition will surely collapse."
mexico.300.a:0 "Against all odds, this big-tent holds firm!"
mexico.300.b:0 "The coalition collapses before it can truly achieve anything."

mexico.301.t:0 "The Military Coups the Coalition"
mexico.301.d:0 "Pancho Villa and Vicente Toledano, despite their best efforts, have been beaten. Despite their experience and best intentions, they were too busy arguing with each other and the other members of the coalition instead of cooperating with each other to work towards an amicable solution for all. Disgusted with their ineffectiveness and sensing the opportunity to strike at this disorganized, shameful, and unprofessional example of ‘leadership,’ a military force led by General Pablo Garza marched into Mexico City early today in order to secure Mexico from inaction and ineptitude. Seizing the government apparatus, Garza and his troops have moved to arrest most of the Socialist government while instituting nation-wide martial law. It would seem that the ideals of the Mexican Revolution are finally dead, for Socialism is no-more in Mexico."
mexico.301.a:0 "How could this happen?"

mexico.302.t:0 "Calles’ Demands"
mexico.302.d:0 "Eufemio Zapata may be interim President, but he desperately does not want the job. A man with no appetite for rule or ambition for power, Eufemio merely wants to find the man who shot his brother. Noticing the perfect opportunity to worm himself in, Plutarco Calles has whispered in Eufemio’s ear, promising to let him lead the investigation into Emiliano Zapata's death if he would just resign and name Calles as the next President. Though Eufemio may be blind to it, this is exactly what Calles has been waiting for, and now the ‘Jefe Máximo’ is just inches away from peacefully obtaining control over Mexico."
mexico.302.a:0 "All I want to do is catch the man who shot my brother. Appoint Calles!"
mexico.302.b:0 "Eufemio overlooks all selfish desires for vengeance, and rises to lead Mexico in its darkest hour."

mexico.303.t:0 "Calles Marches"
mexico.303.d:0 "Despite his best intentions, Eufemio Zapata is doomed, for even though he resisted the siren song of the Jefe Máximo and rose to take his brother’s place despite his own indifference to authority, that has not stopped Calles from getting what he desires. As Eufemio takes his seat at his late brother’s desk within the Palacio Nacional, hundreds of loyal PNR militants and other fervent and violent allies to Calles marched on the capitol. With the Constitutional Guard stretched thin with the on-going manhunt and with the military conveniently nowhere to be found, the Palacio Nacional is largely undefended and unprepared for an attack of such magnitude. \n\nWith Plutarco Calles leading the charge, the compound was quickly overrun, and for the second time in under a year, a Zapata has been slain - shot dead by Calles himself when Eufemio tried to pull a gun on him in a final act of defiance. With the capital under his control and with the second Zapata dead, El Jefe Máximo has finally achieved his lifelong ambition of leading Mexico."
mexico.303.a:0 "Zapata has been slain! Again."

mexico.304.t:0 "Villa Attempts A Countercoup"
mexico.304.d:0 "With Calles having seized power over the nation, chaos and disorder have spread throughout Mexico, for Calles has as many enemies as he does allies and supporters, if not more so. All across our countryside and within our less-supportive cities, Socialist banditos revolt against the rule of El Jefe Máximo. Though varied in their beliefs and disorganized, the vast majority of them have coalesced around the charismatic Pancho Villa, serving as his new Villistas. Though he desires no real position of power, he has risen to do what he believes must be done to safeguard the future and tradition of Mexico. Riding towards Mexico City with a volunteer army at his back, Pancho Villa rides not only to save the nation, but to save the very future of Mexico. However, Calles is not alone in his struggle, and has an army of his own waiting for the vile Socialists to arrive. Now, it is only a matter of time before only one is left standing to lead the nation."
mexico.304.a:0 "Pancho Villa saves the nation from the villainous Calles."
mexico.304.b:0 "Plutarco Calles crushes Pancho Villa and his forces."

mexico.305.t:0 "Garza Attempts A Coup"
mexico.305.d:0 "As Calles continues to consolidate his grip on the nation, beating back any challenge or foe, it has come down to General Pablo Garza to save Mexico from this chameleon’s slick ambitions. Marching into Mexico City with the Constitutionalist Army at his back, General Garza seeks to fight the battered but stalwart Calles for the right to decide Mexico’s fate. With these two strongmen and titans of Mexican governance now doing battle openly in the streets of the capital, it is only a matter of time before a victor stands alone among the rubble. As the forces of Garza and Calles clash like packs of savage, determined beasts, the very destiny of our nation dangles in the balance."
mexico.305.a:0 "Garza saves the nation from Calles’ tyranny."
mexico.305.b:0 "Calles destroys Garza and his men, finally securing Mexico in his grasp."

mexico.306.t:0 "The Question of Villa's Candidacy"
mexico.306.d:0 "With Pancho Villa leading his new Villistas to victory over the villain Calles and his paramilitaries, a new dawn rises over Mexico. Plutarco Calles - El Jefe Máximo - has finally been cast down after his betrayal of Eufemio Zapata, and Socialist democracy has been brought back to dominance once again. With Pancho Villa serving as the interim President, new elections have begun to be organized. However, Pancho Villa himself holds no real desire to hold office or run in the elections, though that has not stopped his allies and compatriots, who have been trying to lift him up as a unity candidate in these rough and uncertain times. With the date of the emergency elections looming, Pancho Villa must make his choice."
mexico.306.a:0 "Despite his apprehension, Pancho Villa decides to run in the elections."

Here, the triggerman was gunned down by pursuing police, but not before they could squeeze some vital information out of him. Though he did not give up any names, it would seem that this terrorist did not act alone, likely being supported by one of any number of known criminal groups, defectors, or other enemies of the state. Though it is not much to go on, we now know others are responsible, and one criminal’s death is not enough until everyone responsible for this attack is brought to justice.

No group in Mexico mourns this loss more deeply than the poor and rural masses who he won over with his populist reforms, with many of them coming to the capital to pay their respects and say their peace to their fallen leader. With a national monument being erected in his honor near the Zócalo, Zapata has been interred in a massive state-built mausoleum decorated with lush plant life, beautiful mosaics, and murals of his exploits painted by David Siqueiros and Diego Rivera.

Suffering from failing health and mental deterioration after the death of his beloved wife Natalia in 1927, Calles has been in a slow, steady decline for over a decade - a decline only accelerated by the rigors of statecraft. As an illustrious state funeral is planned for the father of the Maximato, a power struggle has broken out within the PNR as his closest advisors all jockey with each other to see who shall succeed their fallen leader. Among the clawing and competing masses within the Partido Nacional Revolucionario, three names have risen to the top, with each standing a solid chance at succeeding Calles as the next leader of Mexico - Lázaro Cárdenas, Emilio Portes Gil, and Manuel Perez Treviño. \n\nThe heart of the competition lies between the Revisionist Emilio Portes Gil and the Calles-loyalist Manuel Perez Treviño. Gil seeks to reduce the powers of the President while both expanding the power of the national senate and repealing the harshest of Calles’ old reforms, bringing Mexico under the collective rulership of the PNR behind his presidential facade. In opposition to him, Treviño seeks to uphold the ideals of the Maximato as Calles left them, upholding his reforms while further weakening the non-executive branches of government and uplifting Calles as Mexico’s national father and greatest martyr. \n\nIn stark contrast to both of them, Lázaro Cárdenas stands as the most distinct of the three - a true dark horse despite his close relationship with the late Calles. Disavowing the tyranny his former friend succumbed to, Cárdenas calls for the complete dissolution of the Maximato and of the PNR-dominated congress so that new emergency elections can be held to bring pure democracy back to Mexico. With these three titans of the Mexican Far-Left competing, it truly is any man’s game, but only one can rise to become the true heir to Calles."

mexico.43.t:0 "A Crossroads at the End of a Gun Barrel"
mexico.43.d:0 "General Pablo González Garza has saved Mexico from the brink of certain collapse in the wake of Emiliano Zapata’s assassination, and now both his political future and the wider future of all Mexico is at stake. With the Socialists down but not out, many of those close to Garza have advised the honored general to side with one of two main factions combating Socialist influence within the country. They are the Alianza Antisocialista - a loose coalition of Synarchists, Integralists, Corporatists, and other far-right groups banded together with their shared hatred of Socialism despite their diverse array of members - and the Liga Democrática - a diverse camp of various non-Socialist democratic and republican elements that have resisted the Red Tide since the Revolution began. Allying with either group would certainly beholden us to some of their views and ideas, but both have proven their effectiveness in combating the Socialist menace, so some compromise might still be worth their talents. However, despite their ferocity and usefulness, there have been rumors that should we cooperate with these groups, some of the more zealous amongst them may attempt their own seizure of power. Alternatively, Garza could also simply deny the aid of these radicals and republicans, and instead blaze his own trail for Mexico to follow all on his own. Whatever his choice may be, Mexico’s destiny lies in his hands regardless."
mexico.43.a:0 "Align with the Democratic League."

mexico.44.t:0 "Growing Influence of the Anti-Socialists"
mexico.44.d:0 "The AAS have proven true to their word, and our cooperation has proven to be quite fruitful. Our combined forces have racked up quite a number of victories against the vile Socialist traitors and rebels. Of course, some within the Junta and the wider coalition are growing concerned at the fact that the Sinarquistas are getting the credit and growing in popularity, which has begun to take its toll on the coalition’s stability and cohesion. The largest group of these detractors are within ARM, or Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista. More commonly known as the Camisas Doradas, or ‘Gold Shirts’, ARM is a reactionary paramilitary-turned-political party headed by Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco and Roque González Garza - of no relation to General Pablo González Garza. With the Synarchists rising in popularity and with the ARM growing more discontent with the nature of the AAS, many fear that our coalition is not to be long lived. However, even with these worries in the back of our minds, for now we can claim victory against the rebels and celebrate."
mexico.44.a:0 "Viva Mexico!"

mexico.45.t:0 "The Gold Shirts March on Mexico City"
mexico.45.d:0 "With the Sinarquistas only growing in popularity, the gurgling cauldron of caustic ambition and bitter rivalries brewing within the AAS has at last boiled over, and the once-shakey coalition has finally imploded. With ARM raging against the current political machine, the Synarchists of UNS and Integralists of PIN have banded together in order to resist their new foes. \n\nEven now, more Gold Shirts pour into Mexico City by the hundreds, seeking to topple the AAS regime and establish singular rule under ARM led by Roque Garza and Carrasco. With local police forces and national guard being overwhelmed, and with treachery within the ranks of the main army now all too common, it would seem that ARM has a solid chance at seizing the city. \n\nShould ARM take the capitol, then soon all of Mexico will too fall to the ambitions of Garza and Carrasco. However, if the tide can be turned then Urquiza’s Sinarquistas and Vasconcelos’ Integralistas may just be able to save Mexico from the Gold Shirts."

mexico.45.b:0 "The coup is utterly crushed. Let us now pick up the pieces."

mexico.450.t:0 "One Crisis Averted, Another Begins"
mexico.450.d:0 "With Garza and Carrasco’s mad gamble now both dealt with in one swift blow, the ambitions of the Gold Shirts has been entirely eradicated, with their remaining numbers not already caught or killed by our forces now slinking into hiding. Mexico City is now secure, and with this military crisis now averted, a new political one rises to take its place. \n\nWith the AAS in ruins as effectively one-third of its power now being purged due to their rebellion and its aftermath, the AAS stands at a crossroads. The two main camps left within the clique are the Integralists of PIN - Partido Integralista Nacional - led by José Vasconcelos Calderón and Salvador Abascal, and the Synarchists of UNS - Unión Nacional Sinarquista - led by José Antonio Urquiza, and they compete for influence daily. The Sinarquistas are devoutly Catholic, viscously anti-democratic, and rabidly nationalistic, favoring national syndicalist, populist, and mixed economics, while the Integralistas are Catholics as well, and largely, but not exclusively, monarchists pushing for a decentralized, ‘organic’ Mexico similar to the Spanish and Portuguese Integralist movements. Either of these two factions must now rise to take center stage, and either offer their vision to Mexico unaltered or take notes from their stalwart allies. Regardless, Mexico once again stands at a crossroads under the mercy of a few select strongmen."
mexico.450.a:0 "Urquiza’s Unión Nacional Sinarquista will guide the nation."
mexico.450.b:0 "The Partido Integralista Nacional shall take the lead."

mexico.4501.t:0 "A Herald for the Integralist Regime"
mexico.4501.d:0 "The Partido Integralista Nacional has risen to become the dominant faction within the AAS in the wake of ARM’s failed coup. With the Synarchists forced to play second fiddle to our interests, the Integralistas now dominate Mexico’s government. All that is left now is to choose who shall lead the party into this new future. For years, José Vasconcelos Calderón has led PIN without fail, and thanks to his leadership, an Integralist Mexico has been born. However, some have come to doubt this aging hero’s ability to command the nation in this turbulent time, for the current world stage requires each nation to have an almost mercurial flexibility and adaptability to survive - something this old dog set in his ways may not be capable of. Wanting to push Vasconcelos into an early, but still respected, retirement, this clique of doubters has found a possible replacement in Vasconcelos’ protege Salvador Abascal, whose name has been floated as a suitable heir to Vasconcelos’ vision. Regardless, PIN is destined to guide Mexico into its new Integralist future regardless - now we only have to choose a face to rally behind in this new regime."
mexico.4501.a:0 "The founder of our movement José Vasconcelos Calderón shall lead us."
mexico.4501.b:0 "Vasconcelos’ right-hand man Salvador Abascal rises to lead PIN."

mexico.4502.t:0 "A Strongman for ARM’s Mexico"
mexico.4502.d:0 "Following their successful coup, Generals Roque González Garza and Nicolás Carrasco now stand as the two most powerful men in Mexico, and with Mexico City in their palms, all the nation now must surely bend to their will. However, despite their cooperation and aligning goals, only one of these strongmen can rise to become Mexico’s sole executive, and with each effectively controlling half of the Gold Shirts respectively, this is no small decision. \n\nGeneral Garza saved the nation in the wake of the Gold Shirt coup, and has steadfastly served Mexico in its crusade to rid itself of Socialist taint. Following more mainline corporatist, nationalist, and other contemporary third position principles, Garza is seen as the moderate within ARM to many. On the other hand, Nicolás Carrasco is the far more radical of the two, being even more nationalist and ardently anti-Christian while espousing revivalist ideas about Mexico’s pre-colonial past. Only one of these men can continue to blaze the trail that the Gold Shirts and now all of Mexico follows, and so a choice must be made."
mexico.4502.a:0 "Garza has served us admirably, and will continue to do so."
mexico.4502.b:0 "The radical Nicolás Carrasco wildly seizes the reins of power."

mexico.360.t:0 "Dynasties Old and New"
mexico.360.d:0 "After much debate, our government has decided to restore the long-dead Mexican monarchy - a system not seen since 1867 - and now our administration must decide on which dynasty shall be chosen to ascend to the restored throne. Before us lies three main candidates worthy of the Crown. Firstly and most notably, we could invite Doña María Anna Tunkl-Iturbide, of the House of Habsburg-Itúrbide. Given her illustrious heritage, she is quite famously the granddaughter of Salvador de Itúrbide (himself grandson of our first emperor Agustín and an adopted son of our second monarch Maximilian I). Doña María would be most appreciated by the traditional Catholics and conservative politicians within our government, and would put us on good relations with the various European powers still beholden to monarchical formalities. Alternatively, a 'nativist' clique has emerged, supporting the claims of Don Fernando de Teruel - current holder of the Spanish title of Duke of Moctezuma de Tultengo - a true blood descendent of the last Aztec emperor Moctezuma II. Finally, a third clique has arisen that harkens back to the Porfiriato - the era of Porfirio Díaz’s rule - and as such have risen Porfirio Diaz Jr - nicknamed ‘Porfirito’ by his late father - as a candidate representing a new and purely Mexican line. Whomever is chosen by our regime shall soon be crowned as the newest monarch of Mexico, taking the throne and our shared destiny as their sole burdens."
mexico.360.a:0 "Support the claims of Doña María Anna de Habsburgo-Itúrbide"
mexico.360.b:0 "Choose Don Fernando, the Duke of Moctezuma"
mexico.360.c:0 "Choose Porfirio Diaz Jr., the heir of the Porfiriato"

mexico.361.t:0 "The Fate of Our Leadership"
mexico.361.d:0 "As General Pablo González Garza consolidates his grip on the nation, a final decision about the nature of his regime must be made. Through deft maneuvering and through martial might, Garza and his allies have come to rule over all of Mexico, but have done so through a military junta thinly veiled as a temporary government. Though potentially more stable, and allowing Garza a more open and free hand when governing, this junta has created many enemies for this anti-Socialist crusader. To alleviate these tensions and to legitimize Garza’s rule moreso, many moderates and civilian leaders close to him have suggested that he allow the creation of a new civilian government to rule Mexico in his place. Forming around the Partido Revolucionario de Unificación Nacional, or PRUN, this regime would still fully be beholden to the whims and will of Garza, but would do so behind a thick facade or shackled republicanism and false democracy. Alternatively, General Garza could instead rule with an iron fist, continuing the junta and consolidating it into a full stratocratic regime. Regardless, only Garza now controlled the destiny of Mexico and its people, and now it was up to Garza once again to determine the direction of the nation."
mexico.361.a:0 "Only total military rule can save Mexico now!"
mexico.361.b:0 "Allow a shackled civilian government to form behind PRUN."

mexico.46.t:0 "Garza's Speech"
mexico.46.d:0 "As the sweltering sun began to peek over the caps of the Sierra Madre in the distance and as the lively streets of Mexico City stirred and woke on this cool morning, the heart of the capitol was electrified to life as General Pablo González Garza began his long-awaited speech. Standing atop the front steps of the Palacio Nacional, Garza looked out at the crowd filling the Plaza del Zócalo - the main square of Mexico City continuously in use since the time of the Aztec and Mexica - and began to exclaim his future plans for the nation to the wider public. As a new sun of a new day dawned over the capitol, Garza exclaimed that a new dawn was rising for all of Mexico as a whole, heralding a new age for our war-torn yet stalwart state, and met with cheers and chants of support from the growing mass of citizens that stood before him. \n\nHowever, not all in the crowd were so ecstatic over Garza’s energizing rhetoric, for the crowd concealed a dark plot that was about to unfold. As Garza continued to gesticulate and posture, an armed and masked agent slowly made his way to the front of the crowd, and with Garza’s retinue of bodyguards all distracted and enthralled by Garza’s magnetic words, the hooded figure was able to get uncomfortably close to Garza’s lectern. With Garza reaching the climax of his prepared speech, the crowd was whipped up into a frenzy, and in that rising moment of celebration, hope, and the lively energy of life, a thundering shot rang out, immediately killing any jubilation and replacing it with sheer terror. Drawing first silence then screaming horror from the crowd, the assassin’s work was done, and as Garza collapsed, the masked figure fled as some of Garza’s guards followed in pursuit. With attendants rushing to Garza’s aid and with many already fearing the worst, the future of Mexico has once again been gambled away on an assassin’s bullet."

With Garza’s tragic death at the hand of this murderer, the reins of power have once again been left idle after yet another assassin leaves their mark on our history. In the wake of this chaotic turn of events, a new successor must be quickly chosen to take Garza’s place, for Mexico needs a strongman to guide it now more than ever! \n\nBefore our administration lies two possible heirs to Garza’s position: Felix Díaz and Juan Barragán - both proven loyalists to Garza during his life, and now dedicated heralds for the late hero’s vision. Felix Díaz is more ‘old-school’, following the ideals of the infamous Porfirio Díaz and the Porfiriato as a champion of liberal-conservative authoritarianism. Opposing him, Juan Barragán is far more of a populist authoritarian, and notably is a direct descendent to the House of Moctezuma. Regardless, of who is chosen, allies of Garza can have some peace of mind, for both Díaz and Barragán pay great lip-service to the late hero of Mexico, and both are expected to largely follow Garza’s plans for the nation, with their own small flair added to the mix. Now all that is left to do is choose who shall replace our fallen leader."

### Goldshirts ###

mexico.141.t:0 "The Gold Shirt's Massacre"
mexico.141.d:0 "At 7:45 this evening, the Mexican nation and it's people received an answer to the decades long political instability that would put all debate on the matter of leadership to an profane and violent end. The Conference in Mexico City, originally organized by the Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista, was conceived as a means to end the rivalry between Mexico's Nationalist political strata, such an end was mediated by the paramilitary militia of the Camisas Doradas, The Gold Shirts, who proceeded to storm the building with automatic weapons, killing anyone and everyone in sight. The Synarchists, The Integralists, Republicans, even the old Royal Family, theselves personally invited by the Integralists to attend, none were spared from the cruelty of the Gold Shirt's assault as they gunned down every attendee of the conference and anyone else they perceived as a potential enemy of the state. In the wake of this atrocity, the current administration has been placed under the control of a temporal council lead by the Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista, assuming full control of the apparatus of state under a new, ultra-nationalist government, one hellbent on swiftly and permanently eliminating all threats to the new revolutionary state in Mexico, both within and without."
mexico.141.a:0 "This is about to get very ugly..."

mexico.142.t:0 "ARM assumes power in Mexico amidst coup d'etat"
mexico.142.d:0 "The free world awoke to tragic, horrific news emanating from the capital of Mexico as a spree of mass murders, orchestrated by the paramilitary militia of the Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista, were reported in the streets of the city's municipal districts. At a conference in Mexico City, the various nationalist factions vying for control of Mexico were slaughtered in a deadly trap set by the new revolutionary junta to purge Mexico of their political rivals. With their hardline, right wing rhetoric, fanatical Anti-Catholic doctrine, as well as their controversial views of "Hispanidad", many nations around the world have voiced their outrage, with no one voicing their displeasure more loudly than the Austrian Empire, whose extended family among the Mexican royalty, The Iturbide, were among those slain in the Gold Shirt's revolution."
mexico.142.a:0 "Ruthless Aggression reigns in Mexico City"

mexico.143.t:0 "The Culling of the Cristarios"
mexico.143.d:0 "The merciless consolidation of Mexico under the Camisas Doradas is growing bloodier by the day as the Temporal Council's ultranationalist militias conducted a series of violent purges of Mexico's catholic population from the nation's urban centers. From the clergy to the nunnery to the simple church volunteers, the christian faithful of Mexico found themselves targets of the Gold Shirt's cruelty, as anyone found within the targeted buildings, many of whom surrendered themselves willingly and in solidarity, were promptly lined up against the outer walls and gunned down by rifle and machine gun fire, with the various missions and churches across metropolitan Mexico being systematically burnt to the ground. As the death tolls rises and the fires rage across Mexico's inner cities, it is clear that the Gold Shirt's anti-clerical crusade is only just beginning, with the only real exception to to these recent pogroms being the numerous catholic missions that dot the countryside, which have been largely ignored due to their relative isolation from Mexican society, and have thus been mostly spared from the brutality of the Gold Shirt's onslaught."
mexico.143.a:0 "These sanctimonious charlatans are a disease to be purged, nothing more,"

mexico.144.t:0 "The Hinterlands"
mexico.144.d:0 "With the noose around the neck of Mexico beginning to tighten under the iron boot of the Gold Shirts, the age old tradition of the disenfranchised and beleaguered among the Mexican people escaping into the vastness of the desert to the north has, once again, held true as those persecuted by the Camisas Doradas' ruthless reign, including a large number of the Soldadera, have themselves begun scattering into the desolate sands and rocky hills of our northern provinces. And it is not only the desert that has become a haven for fugitives fleeing the Gold Shirt's purges; the deep jungles of southern Mexico, once the ancestral heartland of the Aztecs, has also seen an increase traffic as refuges and partisans alike have begun shielding themselves beneath the vast jungle canopy west of the border to Guatemala. While hunting down these shirkers and dissenters has become troublesome out in the fringes of the hinterlands, the Temporal Council is confident the rabble and malcontents that seek to undermine the revolution shall rapidly be brought into line and subsequently terminated, no matter how long it takes."
mexico.144.a:0 "You can run, but you can not hide"

mexico.145.t:0 "Maria Gizela de Iturbide missing, body not found among the slain"
mexico.145.d:0 "In the wake of the Camisas Doradas violent decimation of their political enemies, the militiamen responsible for the slaughter in Mexico City held a head count for those killed; the bodies of all of the principle leadership of the both the Integralists and Synarchists are accounted for, as are the bodies of the royalist pretenders to the Second Mexican Empire, the Lady Maria Josepha and her eldest daughter, Maria Anna. However, the status of Maria Josepha's youngest daughter, the Lady Maria Gizela, remains perplexingly uncertain; despite a thorough search of the building at the site of the massacre, as well as an equally thorough throughout Mexico City, the would-be heir to Mexico's imperial throne, has seemingly vanished into thin air. Nevertheless, Temporal Council in Mexico City is convinced that Maria Gizela, despite the lack of her human remains, surely must have perished in the chaos of the revolution."
mexico.145.a:0 "All men must die, why shouldn't the women?"

mexico.146.t:0 "Reticence from General Diaz prompts questions of loyalty"
mexico.146.d:0 "While the ultra-nationalist militia of the Camisas Doradas has shown themselves to be incorruptible allies of the revolution, the question of the allegiance of the military to the ARM is far from certain, most notably where it pertains to the old guard among the counter-revolutionary army, this dilemma was seemingly sparked by the rumors of impudence and insubordination exhibited by the renowned General Felix Diaz. Himself the nephew of the late, great General Porfirio Diaz, a hero of the revolutionary war against Emperor Maximilian, and later, the President of the newly founded Republic of Mexico, it is little wonder that a man like Felix Diaz, like many other generals with a family history of military service, would perhaps become prideful with such a prestigious lineage, his own cousin, also named Porfirio Diaz, is similarly proud of his family's service to the Mexican people, and is also said to have voiced his own reservations about the ARM regime in private. This supposed insolence has sparked some outrage among the general officer corps most loyal to the cause of the Gold Shirts, the most vocal among them being Field Marshall Saturnino Cedillo, a long time rival of both the Generals Diaz, decrying their alleged disloyalty as tantamount to treason."
mexico.146.a:0 "Inform General Cedillo to keep an eye on those two"

mexico.147.t:0 "General Cedillo named Chief of the Army, Ordered to purge Santa Muerte"
mexico.147.d:0 "After the audacious attack in Mexico City and the leadership of the ARM shaken to its core by the sheer extent of Santa Muerte's influence, the Temporal Council has decreed that military action must be taken to halt the spread of the Death Cult's sway over the general populace. In light of this, the ARM leadership has promoted the august field marshal, General Saturnino Cedillo, to the position of Chief of the Mexican Army, a position he has sought since the revolution against the Syndicalists, in the hopes of ridding Mexico of this insane and unpredictable new threat. While the exact nature of the Cult and it's leadership remains unknown, the implication of treason on the part of the Generals Felix and Porfirio Diaz in aiding the assassins in Colonia Doctores clearly points to a conspiracy within the counter revolutionary army. On the order of the Temporal Council, General Cedillo has set out with a contingent of the Gold Shirt's Militiamen with the goal of arresting and interrogating the Cousins Diaz to uncover the full extent of the Santa Muerte Plot."
mexico.147.a:0 "Onward to Veracruz!"

mexico.148.t:0 "Señora de las Sombras"
mexico.148.d:0 "In the shadows of Mexico's great cities, in the vast wildlands of barren deserts and dense jungles, there persists a reverence to a grim and frightening folk legend, one with roots dating back to the age of the Spanish conquest, one that the rural poor Mexico worship as a goddess, and one that goes by a multitude of names, The Skinny Woman, The Bony Lady, The White Sister, The Godmother, and many, many others. But the name that most know her by is that of Mexico's patron saint of death; the Lady of Shadows, Santa Muerte. Once upon a time, she had been little more than an urban legend revered by the Banditos on the run in the desolateness of Mexico's northern deserts, and to hear her name invoked now serves little more than as a means to frighten young children with fantastical tales by the campfire of Mexico's own grim reaper. However, with the situation in the country so desperate, and so many fleeing the chaos wrought by the Gold Shirt's regime into the wilderness of the hinterlands, known to many as the hallowed grounds of Santa Muerte and her faithful, few in number though they may be, our scouts are reporting that many, both among refuges and partisan alike, have taken to seeking solace in bosom of Mexico's Goddess of Death. It is clear that the long term psychological damage of the ARM's terror tactics are having an effect on Mexico's oppressed population if so many have resorted to adhering to the dogma of otherwise obscure folklore, and although the Temporal Council has scarcely addressed the slow rise in popularity of the worship of Santa Muerte in the hinterlands, believing it to be little more than frightful superstition, many among the soldiery are growing restless at the notion that Santa Muerte and her followers might pose far more real of a threat than anyone realizes."
mexico.148.a:0 "The hills have eyes..."

mexico.149.t:0 "Roque and Carrasco clash at council meetings, Inter-Party factionalism divides the ARM"
mexico.149.d:0 "The continuing issues the Temporal Council face in consolidating power in Mexico has encountered a major set back; recent council meetings in Mexico City have been stymied by an increasing ideological conflict between the principle members of the ARM's leadership; the root of this inter-party schism stems from the minds of the revolutionary general Roque González Garza and the paramilitary militia leader Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco, with the former having come to represent the so-called "Old Guard" among the ARM. and the latter representing a cabal called the "New Guard". This rivalry within the ARM seams to be a manifestation of a long-running series of disagreements between Garza and Carrasco regarding the cultural and societal future of the Mexican people; Carrasco and his New Guard have spoken candidly of creating a latin-american utopia, culminating in a complete cultural revolution that would serve as a resurrection of the ancient traditions of the Aztecs, even going so far as to reconstitute the Aztec Religion, including many of its archaic and almost barbaric customs, as Mexico's official state religion. Carrasco's apparent vision of Mexico reincarnated as the mythic Aztlán has disturbed a number of those among both the Temporal Council and the ARM as a whole, and many of them have flocked to the side of General Garza and the Old Guard, with Garza himself echoing their concerns as to the validity, or indeed, the sanity of Carrasco, his supporters and their ambitions, instead insisting on maintaining the party line and secular doctrine of the revolution, urging his cohorts not to indulge in delusional fantasy and dogma. It is clear in the arguments between Garza and Carrasco that the ARM is far more dysfunctional than it appears, and with the regime's recent problems in pacifying the countryside, the ARM may find itself vulnerable to yet another counter-revolution."
mexico.149.a:0 "Patriot against Patriot? What is this, the United States?"

mexico.150.t:0 "Inability to consolidate the countryside reveals critical weakness in the ARM regime"
mexico.150.d:0 "Continuous efforts by the administration of the Gold Shirts to suppress and persecute the remnants of their political enemies have highlighted a crucial flaw in the ARM's powerbase; since assuming control of the country, almost the entirety of he ARM's political power is centered in the urban elite of Mexico's metropolitan cities, with the municipal apparatus of Mexico City itself firmly under the control of the Temporal Council and it's allies. The problem encountered by both the Gold Shirt Militia and the military all keep coming back to the ineffectiveness the regime has had in extending their influence beyond the metropolitan center of the country into the mountains, jungles and deserts that surround them; Mexico itself has always been known as rural country to the rest of the world, and with the nation being relatively under-industrialized compared to the United States combined with the intense lack of modern roads or rail-lines, this means that any large scale attempt exert their influence to the north or south suddenly becomes an immensely problematic endeavor as communications break down and logistics becomes bogged down by Mexico's historically difficult terrain features. Indeed, these issues plaguing the Temporal Council's efforts of consolidation are beginning to mirror the multiplicative issues that the Ottoman Empire has had over the last several decades in reaffirming control over their subject peoples; More and more, the hinterlands to the north and south are rapidly becoming a cauldron of instability,  symbolic of all of the ARM's problems in solidifying their rule from Mexico City, both the military and the militia's failures to bring the countryside to heel are beginning to reflect poorly on the legitimacy of the government, and already, reports of corruption emanating from the military's outposts in both the north and south are beginning to circulate."

But there is another phenomenon has begun to manifest out on the fringes of Mexican backwater; Santa Muerte, the latin deity of death long since driven underground by the likes of Syndicalists and Republicans alike, has seen a resurgence among the refuges and dissidents in the badlands in a manner that is unprecedented, but perhaps not without reason; with the desolation of Mexican people targeted by the tyranny of the Temporal Council, and with such cruel and merciless destruction done against the latin way of life and tradition, many left stranded in the wilderness and hiding from the Gold Shirts are utterly without hope, nevermind faith, from having had their entire livelihoods decimated by the ARM's ruthless reign, in such tragic circumstances, it is of little wonder that faithful of Mexico, having seen both their faith and their families all but wiped out, would than seek answers, comfort, or perhaps even the promise of revenge, in the grim dogma and dark promises of the Mexico's enigmatic Doña Bella Sebastiana. It is not just the refuges that have gradually come under of the followers of Santa Muerte; many among the deserted soldiery and dissenting soldadera have taken to venerating Santa Muerte and a growing number of brothers and sisters among the clergy and the nunnery have taken to incorporating Santa Muerte and her teachings into their sermons, this strange mixing of the faiths of Mexico's downtrodden is slowly growing in popularity."

Such ambitions carry a heavy price for the people of Mexico, and from their suffering, a new and shadowy organization has come to the fore and from the depths of the jungles and beneath the hills of the great deserts, these proud and fanatical followers of Santa Muerte have proclaimed themselves to be the true protectors of Mexico; zealous, capable, cunning and utterly devoid fear, they are nuns, priests, doctors, farmers, miners, soldiers, soldadera, men, women, children and all, risen from the ashes, uplifted from carnage wrought by the brutality of the ARM, all willing and ready to lay down their lives in the name of God, Jesus Christ and the promose of vengeance against the plague bacilli of Roche and Carrasco, and all in the name of the enigmatic La Dama Poderosa, a name given to Santa Muerte, but also one given to the apparent leader and prophet of this new latin faith. Some in the badlands call them Los Iluminados, "The Illuminated Ones,", others compare their strange and ominous beliefs to the old heresies of medieval, calling them "Cathars" for their intense devotion and the inclusion woman priestesses among their faithful, many others, however, simply know them as the Cult of Santa Muerte, and with the ARM regime so exposed with the recent troubles internally, many in Mexico City anxiously lie in wait, staring out from behind the cracked adobe walls of their haciendas, watching the trees and hills beyond for this new, looming threat"

The voice that came across the airways was not one of the Felix that counter-revolutionary army recognized; where the august, collected voice of the veteran field marshal once spoke with calm conviction, Felix Diaz now spoke with a fiery and indignant rage at the ARM Regime, openly and furiously denouncing the crimes of the Gold Shirts as the second coming of Hernán Cortés, decrying their treatment of the people of Mexico, most especially their systematic killing of Catholics, as tantamount to cultural genocide. At this, the Generalissimo called upon the patriotic warriors of the Counter-Revolutionary army to take up arms against the Camisas Doradas, to expunge the plague bacillus of the Temporal Council, lest they place every man, woman and child of Mexico at the mercy of the firing squad.

The Temporal Council remains unimpressed; having shone little sympathy and less concern for the threat of Santa Muerte or their traitorous allies in the army; the uprising in Veracrus is their more pressing, immediate concern. The present strategy placed forward to Cedillo and the General Staff is a decisive and swift put down of the malcontents downtown; a direct march into the city, forcing the surrender and quelling of the mod and dealing out harsh punishment to those who resist; the Council is adamant that, at this stage, violent reconciliation in the face of the rebel threat is of upmost importance for the preservation of the Mexican State, no matter what the usurpatious rabble might think. Field Marshal Cedillo is not so convinced of this notion; the stern-faced Chief of the Army is of the belief that Santa Muerte has set a trap for the army amidst the chaos in the streets and believe that a more methodical, meticulous encirclement of Veracruz to be the best method of dealing with the uprising, they are convinced that Santa Muerte are responsible for inciting the commonfolk to riot, and thusly, likely have agents within Veracruz and that a through sweep of city, avoiding the main areas of unrest in favor of a search, street by street, house by house, room by room, is what should take precedence in order to uncover any agent of the rebellion."

While the Field Marshal's plan was meant to be a less aggressive and dangerous answer to a direct assault on the city, the army chief's plan of slow encirclement is far from a passive response; suppression tactics against dissenters has been harsh and uncompromising with anyone suspected of involvement with Santa Muerte, legitimately or otherwise, were executed, often including even the families of those suspected of involvement with Cult to be placed in front of a firing squad. As cruel and uncompromising as the advance into Veracruz was, the results of Cedillo's advance proved successful; numerous individuals identified as acolytes and priestesses of Santa Muerte, were discovered collaborating with agitators in the mob, supplying them with rudimentary weapons and bombs and organizing the rioters to strike targets of interest in the city. With the resistance cells in the city pacified, the moral of the rioters was sapped as the army slowly closed in on the city center, and by day's end, the army of General Cedillo marched into the Plaza of the city center, the remnants of the rioters ether dispersed or dead on the ground as the army reestablished control over Veracruz, the city itself having suffered major damage as a result of the fighting."

Under the scorching heat of the morning sun, the army marched into the city center, where bulk of the mob simmered in the pale orange light of the burning buildings that surrounded them as the army rode up to meet them; the rabble glared at General Cedillo with barely contained hatred as he ordered the crowd to disperse and return to their home, quietly and orderly. The noise that greeted the Field Marshal's dictum was nothing human; a thunderous, ear-splitting roar as the mob rose up to charge at the lines and lines riflemen before them, their number seeming to spawn out of the ether; they came out of alleyways, out of the sewers like rabies-ridden rats. What ensued was a carnage unlike any Mexico has ever seen; Cedillo's rifles cracked at the oncoming mob, killing dozens in the first volley, and still, the people came on, armed with little more than improvised melee weapons for the most part as their numbers continued overran Cedillo's men. The fanaticism displayed by the rioters was no less terrifying; scores of unarmed men charged at soldiers armed with rifle and bayonet only to be cut down without the slightest concern for their own mortality, woman wrapped their arms around soldiers and held them in place as their comrades immolated them both with firebombs fill with kerosene, and at the height of the attack, an elderly man drove a truck filled with dynamite right into a contingent of soldiers moments before a molotov cocktail utterly obliterated the whole lot of them.

General Cedillo, meanwhile, seems to have been taken aback by the zealotry and cunning displayed by the Santa Muerte Cult and their allies, so much so that he has begun to eye the civilian population in San Luis with suspicion, paranoid that if the cult could influence the people of Veracruz so corrosively, can the same thing happen in San Luis? It is because of this fear that General Cedillo suggested a method of striking against the rebels directly; rather than reinforce their ranks and fortify San Luis, and potentially leaving themselves vulnerable to enemy infiltration, Cedillo purposes instead to order a lockdown of the city and prepare an artillery bombardment against the city itself from a fortified position overlooking San Luis. Cedillo argues that the rebels, given that their fanaticism was shown to be almost psychotic at Veracruz, would not respond to the bombardment of San Luis rationally, making the enemy abandon their plans in the city in favor of a suicidal assault the army's fortified position, recklessly throwing their lives away to protect the people in San Luis Naturally, the general staff was horrified by the implications and ramifications of such a brutal plan, both for the plan's eerie resemblance to General Erich von Falkenhayn's unsuccessful strategy of attrition in the German offensive at the Battle of Verdun in the Weltkrieg as well as the obvious potential for immense numbers of civilian casualties of the population still trapped in the city."

The Nahua, the proud and indefatigable sons and daughters of the Aztec Empire, fiery and defiant, flying crop dusters and decades-old biplanes, flying so close to the ground they flew below the height of the buildings, almost kissing the street as they descended upon Cedillo's army from the air, the plane's pilots and passengers strafing the exposed soldiers with submachine gun and firebombs. At this, the paranoia espoused by Saturnino Cedillo was tragically and frighteningly proven right; just as the Nahua begun their attack, soldiers among the reconstituted army, conscripted into the ranks of the army from the citizenry of the city, turned their rifles on their companeros, screaming "Morir Es Vivir!" as their rifles cracked against, their traitorous air-bound comrades roaring overhead. It was not long before the city of San Luis Potosi was a mirror image of Veracruz; burnt and burning buildings, dead and dying soldiers, and the people, cunningly bewitched by the rebel air assault, began flowing out of their shelters, rioting in concert with the rebel's assault, trashing and burning all in their path.

What happened next was something no one could have predicted; aircraft, outmoded biplanes for the most part, appeared over the horizon and began besieging the artillery emplacements from above just as the first of the rebels came roaring out of the jungle into the northern hills, harrying the defensive line with sniper fire, mortar fire, rifle fire and makeshift firebombs as the aircraft strafed the artillery emplacements with fly-by sub machine gun fire, and through it all, the drumfire of Cedillo's bombardment thundered against the city below, slowly and ruthlessly reducing San Luis to rubble as the creeping barrage continued to rake the city. But in this great duel of wits between General Cedillo and Santa Muerte's militia, the so-called Strongman of San Luis showed himself to be correct in his assumption of the recklessness of the rebel threat; man and woman were mowed down in human wave assaults to see the army dislodged from the heights, and the archaic state of the aircraft besieging the army meant that they were vulnerable to machine gun fire and were rapidly shot out the sky. By nightfall, dead bodies and burnt-out planes lined the hillside, the cannonade had ceased, the army worked to put out the fires in the city, and victory had been achieved."

mexico.171.d:0 "Trepidation filled the air in the Capital City, even as the common people tried to go on about their day, the soldiers marching, the armored cars patrolling the streets, snipers on the rooftops, the checkpoints, the road blocks, and through it all, the creeping sense of dread as thehour of reckoning drew nearer. Both the army and the Temporal Council must have felt it too; the members of the Council leadership awaiting an update from General Cedillo, who himself sat outside the capital building with his army in the city center, watchful for any sign on corruption, as the first reports from the forward scouts over the radio made it clear to both the General and the Council that something was coming just as dark-clothed figures appeared in the distance. They were of all colors; soldiers and shipwrights, doctors and priests, cultists and cristeros, old men and woman to young girls and boys, all dressed in black, from elegant, embroidered suits and gowns all the way down to the  tattered garb of tramps, they painted their faces like the Day of the Dead, as beautiful as they were frightening, they marched in complete and utter silence through the streets of city, leaving many of the soldiery near-dumbfounded, as much by their sheer numbers, but for the ominous calm they displayed as they marched. And at the center of it all marched the beating heart of this silent rebellion: the Cousins Diaz were there, at the head of a contingent of Soldaderas, Don Tultengo was there, surrounded by his brave Nahua patriots, Father Vega was there, flanked by his pious Sonora Knights, and finally, the lady Maria III, dressed in the blue tunic, iron breastplate and steel pickelhaube of a viennese cuirassier, not the gown of a mere Habsburg courtier, but the garb of a true Kaiserin, an Empress. Having had enough of Maria III's impudence, a furious General Cedillo gave the order to open fire on the crowd, and from the radio, came a single, cold reply:"
mexico.171.a:0 "Morir Es Vivir!"
mexico.171.b:0 "Siempre Leales!"

mexico.172.t:0 "México Sobre Todo"
mexico.172.d:0 "At the center of Mexico City, under heavy rainfall, the first volley of the army opened fire across the plaza, followed by the screams of the condemned as the first of the marchers, many of them young children, fell dead by the armies bullets, their blood congealing in the mud under the feet before the rain swept them both away as their numbers were cut down to size. The crowd fractured seemingly in an instant, many of then scattering at the army's assault, and still more fell from the volley, woman, children, the elderly, no one was innocent in the eyes of the army, and none were spared ether; Father Vega and his Cristeros fell first, than the younger Porfirio Diaz, the Nahua ferociously tried to defend Don Tultengo before they too were gunned down, just as their king was captured by the Gold Shirt's militia men, the sound of their rifles booming in concert with the cracking of thunder. When the storm finally did subside, so too did any doubt that the army, and the ARM alongside them, had won the day, and upon his inspection of the massacre, Saturnino Cedillo would come upon a wounded Felix Diaz kneeling before the body of Maria III, the would-be Empress having been shot more than a hundred times, her long brown hair undone and fallen across her shoulders, laying on her back in a great pool of human blood, her arms wrapped around the bodies of her faithful, her face as white as the Bony Lady herself.  "Plans can change, even divine ones." Cedillo is rumored to have said to a defeated General Diaz before executing him on the spot. The victorious General Cedillo, cavalier at his success, rode back to the capital building on horseback to inform the Temporal Council of their triumph, and upon hs arrival, in an act mirroring Erich Ludendorf's Siege of Liege, greeted the leadership of Mexico by banging on the council chambers with the hilt of his saber, delivering the news that the Cult of Santa Muerte, along their insurrection, was no more."

mexico.173.t:0 "The Deluge"
mexico.173.d:0 "It was a great thunderstorm raging in the skies over Mexico City that heralded the end of the Temporal Council; as an enraged Saturnino Cedillo screamed into his radio that the oncoming rebels be stopped dead in their tracks, the soldiery, meanwhile, sapped of all loyalty to ARM or their revolution, meekly lowered their rifles, bowing their heads, some even kneeling before the crowd as they made their journey forward, with the remainder of the Gold Shirts scattering like rats out of fear for their mortal souls. As the precession gathered near the door to the capital building, the Lady Maria Gizela de Iturbide von Habsburg, long thought to have died the night of the Gold Shirt's Putsch, now stood before the building where her mother and sister were murdered, her face painted like a skull, the rose-covered visage of La Calavera Catrina, rainwater glistening off the steel of her breastplate, the flash of lightning reflecting off her spiked Pickelhaube helmet, a leather-bound bible clutched in one hand, and a gold-encrusted Gasser revolver in the other; this was the new face of authority in Mexico, this was the face that would uproot the balance of power in the so-called "free world", both in this life, and the next. Field Marshal Saturnino Cedillo, at last, fell silent, the bellicose and ruthless Chief of the Army, the would-be architect of Maria's demise, stood at the foot of the door to the Capital, flanked by the few loyal militiamen of the Gold Shirts that hadn't fled already, the absolute last line between the Temporal Council and the retribution that was to soon overtake them. "You frighten me, General, and you have caused me great pain." the Lady told him, her cultured, Viennese accent clashing with the gothic figure that stood before him: "Now, you see how crude such things are as weapons, for both Fear and Pain only exist to be defeated." At this, she placed the bible against Cedillo's face before perforating it, and him, with a bullet. By the time the storm subsided, the bodies of every surviving member of both the Gold Shirts and the Temporal Council would be hanging from every streetlamp. A new american empire has been unleashed."

Initially thought to have been slain in the ARM's putsch a year prior, the sole surviving member of Iturbide dynasty found shelter among the enigmatic Cult of Santa Muerte, and with Maria III's ascendance to the throne, now with a populist revolt backing her, she is determined to reforge Mexico into an empire in something more than name, and with the ongoing political crisis in the United States, it may not be long before the Mexican Army marches beyond it's borders once again.

Under his leadership, Mexico is now free of the plagues of Socialism and Liberalism, and instead our nation now lies in the secure and noble comfort of nationalism and anti-European thought. Long holding a love for Mexico’s pre-colonial past, Carrasco has been known to dabble in Mexica and Aztec culture quite heavily, with his passion becoming obsession in the eyes of many. With these long-standing biases and interests only deepening as Carrasco delved deeper into Mexico’s past, and with his unparalleled level of current control, Carassco has taken this time as opportunity to revamp the cultural and national identity of the state towards a more post-classical, pre-colonial foundation. \n\nWith the initial ideas and new decrees in place, Mexico has already begun to shed its ‘Western’ influenced identity, and now the only debate is how far Carrasco should go. He could simply pay lip service and deep homages to the once noble Aztec empire and other Mesoamerican aspects of our culture, similar in ways to Mussolini’s famed love for ancient Rome. However, if left unleashed and unshackled, Carrasco wishes to not only harken to, but fully embrace and revitalize the culture and very essence of the fallen Aztec Empire as the new identity for our rebirthed state. Such a dramatic shift would likely cause immense growing pains, but with Carrasco already forcing many of his colleagues to refer to him as ‘Tlatoani,’ or King in Nahuatl, such a dramatic shift may be inevitable at this point..."

With each of the 18 months and the final 5-day fast of Nemontemi each calling for a specific ritual or sacrifice in order to ensure specific occurrences, phenomena, and natural boons, this spiritual guide shall serve as the basis of our return to the Aztecs’ renowned sacrificial practices. These ideas, though seemingly barbaric, are based upon Mexica principles of paying tribute, or ‘tequitl’, to the many Teotl in the pantheon in exchange for gifts and continued existence. From the payment of these tributes - most precious of all being ‘chalchiuatl’ or blood and literally meaning ‘most precious water’ - the old empire and now our restored one shall be revitalized and sustained on sacrifice. \n\nFrom the child sacrifices honoring Tláloc in Atlacacuallo to the fiery executions dedicated to Xiuhtecuhtli in Xocotlhuetzin, all of our past traditions are to be observed and followed as closely as possible. With this claim however, many have come to wonder if our Tlatoani shall take his final right at the end of the cycle which calls for autosacrifice to ensure the rising of the sun and the continued survival of the empire, though Itzcoatl II has dodged these questions at all cost. Regardless, the vicious and bloodthirsty reputation of our people have been restored, and sacrifices honoring the Teotl have already begun in earnest. \n\nHeading into battle in one of our newly revived ‘flower wars’ - or wars with both allies and enemies used primarily for ritual and the gathering of sacrificial tributes - the high priests of Mēxihco-Tenōchtitlan have called for a preliminary sacrifice to grant the Teotls’ blessing upon our mighty warriors. The ‘Quetzalcoatls’, or high priests who bear the name of our patron god as their title - ordered loyal Cuachicuqeh (the loyal temple guard and most prestigious military order in the empire) to retrieve 100 prisoners from the temple complexes in order to prep them for traditional sacrifice. Placed atop a stone mantle at the peak of the rebuilt Great Pyramid, these souls were adorned in ritualistic garb and body paint before an obsidian athame was used to disembowel their torsos and excise their still-beating hearts. All one hundred hearts were to be offered up as tribute to the Teotl of War and the Sun Huitzilopochtli so that the great eagle lord would grace us with victory in the coming struggle. May their blood, our blood, the blood now given to the Teotls, be enough to grant us temporary divinity!"

Here, the ministers of the Liga Democrática will, through shrewd debate and carefully orchestrated cooperation, outline the framework of our rebirthed republican system with a new democratic constitution - the Constitución Política de México. As delegates from all major parties, from PRUN to the PLM, arrive and cross the Plaza del Zócalo into the National Palace, the final preparations are being made before this historical convention can be held. With an initially agreed-upon plan for the proceedings being known to all before we begin, the general framework of our future constitution is already partially agreed upon. However, this does not mean that this meeting of the New Constituent Congress will be any short or quick affair - days upon days of debate, compromise, and argumentation are expected, and the process could easily evolve into a multi-week ordeal. Regardless of the time it takes, at the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention, we shall have a secure republican foundation off of which we can safely launch our first fair and free elections. Now come, let us make history!"
mexicodemocratic.1.a:0 "Let the Convention begin!"

mexicodemocratic.2.title:0 "Fate of the Socialist Radicals"
mexicodemocratic.2.desc:0 "Now that most of the radical Leftists that once harassed and suppressed our nation, from the banditos of Pancho Villa to the fanatics of Zapata, have all either been captured, killed in the process, or for some lucky few, simply knowing where their current holdout is, a final decision must be made on what to do with these Socialists. Before us stands three clear, cut and dry options, and each holds their own weight. We could simply execute them all, ridding Mexico of their viral taint but also establishing a bloody reputation that many within the nation will come to revile or even fear. Alternatively, we could simply exile these extremists, forcing them all into whatever wastes lie outside our nation, to be some other nation’s problem. However, there is always the possibility that they will return and in greater force. The third option, seen as the middle ground to many, is to simply put them all on trial and sentence them to lifelong prison sentences as traitors of the state. While we would have to take care of these whelps within their protective cells, it would not lower our regime to be murderers like those we are trying to persecute, and not leave them to potentially return with support if exiled. With the ministers of the LD torn over this issue, it is unsure which group will come out on top."
mexicodemocratic.2.a:0 "Execute them all! We have munitions to spare."
mexicodemocratic.2.b:0 "Arrest them officially and put them before a ‘fair’ trial."

mexicodemocratic.3.desc:0 "After the attempted coup by AAS forces, our own administration counter-attacked, leading to the capture of most of the AAS’ leadership. With this great victory for justice and peace, questions now arise about the fate of these extremist traitors. Though many in our cabinet have pushed for simply exiling them, that is not an option in this case, for no place on Earth currently would openly accept a bunch of failed, unorganized, and thoroughly beaten Mexican nationalists into their ranks. Instead, we have two main routes to reach justice. We can either put down each one of these dogs with a round inscripted with their own name - one for every traitor in the bunch. However, this would likely set a bloody precedent others in the nation could look to as a dangerous example, so as an alternative, many have instead suggested holding a show trial, condemning each of these radicals to stand before a jury and the people of Mexico and be sentenced to life in prison. Though a less satisfying and more expensive form of justice, it would be justice all the same, and would go a long way in sealing our legitimate image in the eyes of the masses. What shall we do?"

The Campesinos, or tenant farmers of the crumbling Ejido system and other agricultural cooperatives and rented parcels, have raged against the urban-centered government for far too long, and something must finally be done. With our renewed strength and newfound stability, we are in a opportune position to finally end this peasant uprising. We can either march our troops directly into their largest known strongholds, eradicating their numbers and decimating their organization structure despite the likely high amount of casualties that will affect both sides. In contrast, we could instead approach their leaders peacefully, and through compromise and cooperation we could attempt to work towards a peaceful resolution without spilling a drop of innocent blood. With our administration free to do as they wish in this instance, it is truly up to us how we should handle the Campesinos."

Now that republicanism has been reintroduced and with civilian leaders back in control, many ministers of the LD have become preoccupied with the fear of it happening again. We need to finally decide what to do with the army: let the dangerous but long-standing status quo ride - possibly earning the military’s loyalty but keeping them open as a possible rogue agent, or force the entire armed forces under the civilian rule of the republican government, which will likely anger the military and their political group the PARM, but greatly reducing the likelihood of a military coup plaguing Mexico ever again."

mexicodemocratic.5.b:0 "Enforce civilian rule. The army is an arm of the state, not the state itself."

mexicodemocratic.6.title:0 "Fate of the Church"
mexicodemocratic.6.desc:0 "Now that the anti-clerical Socialists have been ousted from power, we need to decide how religion shall fit into our new constitution? The two most obvious choices are quite simple on paper: a Secular Mexico or a Catholic Mexico. However, the underlying debate could not be more complex. Catholicism is part of Mexico’s history and tradition, being brought here by Spanish colonials long before a ‘Mexico’ even existed. It has formed one of the pillars of Mexican society for centuries, and despite the Socialist’s attempt to eradicate it, Catholicism is still alive and well in the nation, forming one of the bedrocks of our culture. Regardless, many modernists, liberals, and moderate republicans all argue that while Catholicism is important to Mexican life, it should in no way interfere with our government, and despite many of them being devout Catholics themselves, they have vehemently pushed for a Secular state with religious freedoms instead. The question is still hotly debated among the ministers of the LD at the convention, but in the end, only one side can come out on top."
mexicodemocratic.6.a:0 "State Catholicism is only natural for a pious land such as Mexico!"
mexicodemocratic.6.b:0 "In the pursuit of modernity and equality, Mexico shall be Secular!"

mexicodemocratic.7.title:0 "Debate Over Republican Term Lengths"
mexicodemocratic.7.desc:0 "With democratic elections slowly being prepared in the background as this convention drags on, we need to preemptively decide how long a republican term shall be, keeping in mind that each executive can only sit for one full term at maximum. Like all debates within the convention, this too is split along party lines, with Liberals like those in the PLC championing a 4-year term, while Social Democrats and Progressives from the PCP and PLM are pushing for 5 years. Finally, the Conservatives of the PRUN and PAN have called for the largest term length at 6 years each. With each having their merits and drawbacks, what should we go with to solidify republican electoral term limits for generations to come?"
mexicodemocratic.7.a:0 "Go with the Liberal plan of 4-year terms."
mexicodemocratic.7.b:0 "The Progressives make a point. Go with 5-year terms."
mexicodemocratic.7.c:0 "The Conservatives are quite convincing. 6-year terms it will be."

mexicodemocratic.8.title:0 "Power of the Executive"
mexicodemocratic.8.desc:0 "With term limits determined and the general framework of our republic coming into formation, we need to decide how much power the head of government will have. Do we need a strong Executive or do we weaken its power? A strong executive is favored by the Conservatives, who view the position as above the other branches of government, being the main vehicle of change in the future republic. However, the Progressives and Liberals fear a strong executive will erode democracy and give way to authoritarianism. They propose instead that the executive should be shackled to the other branches of the government as an equal, with fair checks and balances between the branches to keep all in check. This proposal is seen as weak and naive by the Conservatives, who feel that without a strong executive, the nation will be at the slow mercy of a legislature that never acts quickly or decisively when needed. Both sides have made their points, and now it is up to the final internal vote among the LD."
mexicodemocratic.8.a:0 "A strong executive means a strong state! Grant the executive sweeping powers."
mexicodemocratic.8.b:0 "The executive is merely the mouthpiece of the people. Weaken their power."

mexicodemocratic.9.title:0 "A Unitary Mexico or a Federalized Mexico?"
mexicodemocratic.9.desc:0 "Mexico already has states - 28 in fact - and they are not going anywhere. However, with the Constitutional Congress in session, there is an opportunity to change what being a ‘state’ of Mexico truly means. The two main camps of the argument are whether Mexico should be fully federalized, similar to the system of the once-noble United States of America, or should we push for a unitary system through centralization as much as possible. Though the states would still exist, in this centralized system, they would be little more than organizational units for census data and election planning. A middle-ground between these two camps has risen as well, seeking compromise so that unity can be maintained. This moderate group calls for all states to be granted limited autonomy, with more troublesome states getting slightly more than the loyal states of the interior, in order to promote as much cohesion and unity as possible without hampering the rights of the people or the job of the government. With the debate still hotly argumented, the outcome is unclear, but soon a choice must be made."
mexicodemocratic.9.a:0 "States shall be little more than organizational units. Total centralization is the way."
mexicodemocratic.9.b:0 "States will be given limited autonomy, but will still mostly bend to the Federal government."
mexicodemocratic.9.c:0 "States are to have wide autonomy, similar to our northern neighbors."

mexicodemocratic.10.title:0 "The Final Debate: Republic or Monarchy?"
mexicodemocratic.10.desc:0 "The final, and by-far the most important and impactful decision of the entire Constitutional Convention, is to be finally decided after what feels like an eternity of debate: whether Mexico should be a Democratic Republic or a Republican Monarchy. The last few decades of instability and violent chaos have proven to many that the Republic model is unsustainable, prone to stalling, corruption, and military coups. These disillusioned democrats instead cry out that only under the restored Crown republicanism truly thrive in Mexico without falling prey to villainous taint. So dedicated to the cause, these Monarchists have even gone as far as to contact the heiress to the throne, Maria Josefa de Iturbide. Despite their jump at the chance to restore the monarchy, many within the LD still have their reservations, with most of the Liberals and Progressives decrying this move as an act of tyranny and a backhand to everything they have worked so far to achieve. These devoted republicans feel as though the only way for Mexico to truly escape the bonds of its past is to break into modernity with a free and fair democracy. With the debate over this question reaching new heights of vitriol and violence, a decision must be made soon lest the entire convention collapse into a brawl."

On a platform of pure Social Democracy, fair Social Capitalism, and the creation of a full welfare state, the PLM under Lázaro Cárdenas has risen to become the most popular democratic party in Mexico, standing a good chance of sweeping the entire election.

However, in order to fully convince Garza of his new deradicalized attitudes, Cárdenas had to prove to them he was truly reformed, and the only way Garza was going to be convinced was if Cárdenas sold out his old allies. If Cárdenas was willing to tell Garza were top officials from Calles’ party, the Totalist PNR, were hiding out, Garza was willing to allow the PLM to continue operations."

This would seal the PLM’s fate as one of the allowed democratic parties, and eradicate any far-Left extremist threat, but Lázaro Cárdenas’ old friends Abelardo L. Rodríguez and Emilio Portes Gil would have to die. However, Cárdenas had already grieved for this eventuality long before the meeting was held, and he was ready to trade his loyalty in order to safeguard the Left’s place in our democracy for many generations to come.

The reasoning behind their deaths are unclear, but the official story being circulated and promoted by the press and government is that they committed suicide to avoid capture, and a wandering rancher herding his cattle came across the scene by chance, calling it into the police before leaving the scene to not get caught up in some trial.

With our military requiring all officers to be apolitical by law, this is grounds for a court martialing if true. However, our President - ever the beacon of true justice - has decided to hear out this case personally in a private government court rather than to make a decision based on rumors, hearsay, and conjecture.

They say it is because Camacho is truly a Synarchist, and Camacho pleads that they are simply trying to remove him as an obstacle while trying to make it up the military hierarchy. With too many unknowns within the case and little to no evidence to decide by, President [MEX.getleader] called Maximino to the stand to defend himself before a final verdict is made."

The official charges include gun-smuggling, war racketeering, aiding an outlawed extremist group, and much more, which if proven to be true would certainly destroy the company’s reputation and finances.

The document was signed by the business leaders of the company and by Salvador Abascal - the leader of the AAS’ paramilitary called the Gold Shirts.

With another massive manufactory under their control, the men of the PLC are just expected to grow more wealthy as these ‘traitorous’ businessmen face ‘justice.’ Calling it a mere ’act of the law,’ it would seem that Alemán was after a little more than just justice, and the PLC has been revealed as the true winners in all this misery."

However, taking in such vast amounts of gringo dominated land has been no easy task. The majority of the population in our new northern states are English speaking "Anglos" who have begun to actively resist our rule. These Yanquis are well armed, well motivated, and well supplied by northern contacts, and as such many within our regime fear that these former Americans will try to rebel against us given the chance.

These hit-and-run attacks are aimed at crippling our infrastructure, our industrial output, and the morale of our forces. With these attacks happening so frequently across the nation, we are stretched too thinly to be able to stop them all, and so must choose which sectors to prioritize and which ones to ignore for the time being.

In response, our forces have already begun the long march to meet their foes, but the vast distances within our enlarged nation means the rebels will have time to dig-in and entrench their positions if we are too slow.

We must make Santa Anna proud and finish what he started all those decades ago. There will be no Second Alamo, or a second or third or any free ‘Texas.’  Tejas is rightfully Mexican clay, and we will prove it to these gringos again and again with shot and blade until they finally learn this fact.

Citing these sins and Hollywood’s history of graft and expropriation, some hardliners have suggested instead that the area be purged and razed to the ground so that we may build something far more useful for ‘el pueblo’ in its place. While industrialising the studios would boost California's recovery, the studios make a lot of taxable money, and our new citizens Norteños will be upset, which has pushed some others to instead advocate for either complete nationalization of the studios or instead transfer the estate to public ownership of the proletariat.

These 'conservatives' argue that such a reorganisation would centralise administration of the old U.S. states and streamline governance over the North while exalting Mexican pride and erasing the estadounidense colonialism over Mexico's ancestral lands. The 'progressive' faction, meanwhile, dismiss these borders as vague even for the time, and further denounce the scheme as archaic, impractical and bound to outrage the Anglos more than ever. Instead, the progressives argue, the established former U.S. State administrations are already functional, well-organised and stable, and therefore should be adopted in full and merely expanded upon.

Therefore, we should expand on the act, as it is our moral imperative that we grant assistance to the destitute American Indian and begin lifting them from oppression at last."
mexico_req.55.a:0 "Yes, we stand alongside the oppressed Indian."
mexico_req.55.b:0 "These ‘Indians’ have no place in our Mexico."

mexico_req.56.t:0 "Status of Women in the Territories"
mexico_req.56.d:0 "Anglo women have taken to the streets in planned demonstrations — not against Mexican occupation, but for women's rights. While generally critical of Mexico's actions, suffragists have decided to make the best of our progressive government and have thus petitioned Mexico City to succeed where Washington failed by officially extending Mexico's Constitutional rights of women to the Northern Territories."
mexico_req.56.a:0 "Grant universal rights for all women!"
mexico_req.56.b:0 "Grant women voting rights in all local assemblies!"
mexico_req.56.c:0 "Now is not the best time."

mexico_req.57.t:0 "Status of Religion in the Territories"
mexico_req.57.d:0 "While Mexico has historically been a Catholic country, the Anglos take on the religious heritage of England: Protestantism. The people in the Northern Territories — Tejas in particular — are deeply religious, so the Comité must tread carefully as it seeks to tinker with religious policy. It would be foolish, however, to ignore intelligence reports from our spy service which emphasise how the local churches are condoning, aiding and abetting the insurrectionists, many of whom are zealous Protestants themselves."
mexico_req.57.a:0 "Enforce Catholicism as the state religion"
mexico_req.57.b:0 "Enforce anti-clerical laws of 1917 Constitution"
mexico_req.57.c:0 "Let the Protestants freely go about their business"

mexico_req.58.t:0 "Status of Language in the Territories"
mexico_req.58.d:0 "The majority of both the Mexican and Anglo populations do not speak each other's language, which is already sparking incidents of civil unrest in the Northern Territories and our border states like Baja and Sonorra. While forcing the entire Anglo population to learn and speak Spanish would be impractical to say the least, perhaps some basic public programs could assist our troops and settlers in the North. The principal subject of this session of the Comité is simple. From schools and government operations to restaurants and street signs, what will be the official language that is used for everything within the Northern Territories?"
mexico_req.58.a:0 "Español! The gringos will learn our tongue and they will do it fast!"
mexico_req.58.b:0 "Bilingüe/Bilingual! We will accommodate these Anglos."
mexico_req.58.c:0 "English! We must appease these rowdy Yanqs."

mexico_req.59.t:0 "The Reintegration of the Mexican Cession"
mexico_req.59.d:0 "After many years of extensive resettlement, intensive propaganda efforts, and numerous crushed uprisings, organised rebellion against Mexican governance has largely subsided. While some resistance persists among old militia extremists, Anglos at large have gradually come to terms with our rule and settlers are now a significant minority in the Northern Territories. With Los Territorios Reconquistados firmly under our control, we've won unhindered access to its resources and industry as the Mexican Cession and the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo have finally been undone."
mexico_req.59.a:0 "A decades-old humiliation has finally been avenged!"

mexico_req.9.t:0 "Reclaiming Our Lost Territories"
mexico_req.9.d:0 "In 1848, as a result of our defeat in the Mexican-American War, we were forced to cede nearly half of our territory to the United States as per the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in an event known as the Mexican Cession. The reversion of this treaty has been a dream for the Mexican people since then, but now there may finally be a chance of undoing this grave humiliation against our nation. Now, with the USA embroiled in a civil war of its own making, the titan’s back is turned, and now could be our chance to regain our lost lands and reassert Mexican control north of the Rio Grande, from California all the way to Tejas! The Americans can only cede land they still control, however, so we must move quickly!"
mexico_req.9.a:0 "Send the demand for the return of our territories."
mexico_req.9.b:0 "We can't afford direct conflict, just quietly stake our claims."
mexico_req.9.c:0 "Are you mad? This is too dangerous!"

mexico_req.10.t:0 "Mexican Territorial Demands"
mexico_req.10.d:0 "Mexico has decided to use the ongoing American Civil War as an opportunity to reclaim the territories they lost to us due to the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo! Seeking to undo the Mexican Cession, they have amassed their troops at the border and now demand all of the land we still control that was ‘taken’ from them during the Mexican-American War. How should we react?"
mexico_req.10.a:0 "Cede disputed territory, we can't afford another front"
mexico_req.10.b:0 "Never! Those lands are American!"

mexico_req.11.t:0 "The Americans Refuse Our Demands"
mexico_req.11.d:0 "The foolish leadership of the United States has refused to accept our rightful territorial claims. They laugh in the face of our demands for undoing the Mexican Cession, and have gone back to focusing fully on their current conflict - though some within their regime have tried to coax our support through underground channels with territorial promises. These elements instead wish to buy Mexican support in their failing war with promises to give back land taken in the Mexican-American war. With this offer on the table, with their backs still turned, and with their resistance as desperate as ever, what shall we do now to the crumbling titan of North America?"
mexico_req.11.a:0 "Mexico shall rise to take America’s place in the New World; to war!"
mexico_req.11.b:0 "We are not ready for war. We must back down, at least for now."
mexico_req.11.c:0 "Perhaps a deal could be arranged..."

mexico_req.110.t:0 "The Yanqui Offer"
mexico_req.110.d:0 "Though our initial try at diplomacy was met with rejection, it would seem Washington has further plans to ensure their survival. Their delegation has returned to us with a simple but interesting counter-offer: in exchange for receiving complete control over the lands of the Mexican Cession back, the Americans wish us to join the Second American Civil War on their side in order to help them beat the Pacific States and the Union State. Though they were clear they did not wish to throw Mexican lives away in the Rust Belt or the Deep-South, for they know we have no claim or interest to such territories, they have asked our armies to give forth full military effort in order to crush their Western foes. If we accept this deal, practically a third of their nation would be ceded to us - a steep cost but it may be the only way for them to win their foolish war. With opportunity knocking once more, what shall our reply be?"
mexico_req.110.a:0 "We shall fight side-by-side to undo the Mexican Cession and save their pathetic nation."
mexico_req.110.b:0 "We would rather die than serve with these Yanquis. Continue the war!"

mexico_req.111.t:0 "Hold Up Our End?"
mexico_req.111.d:0 "We have finally won the Second American Civil War, but before we can bask in the glow of our hard-fought victory, we must first deal with the meddling of the capital. With Washington’s deal with Mexico standing firm, and with the Mexicans proving vital in our final victory, their regime has come knocking about the land we supposedly ‘owe’ them now. With the deal struck and sealed with the spilled blood of both of our soldiers, it would most likely cause another war if we were to betray the Mexicans now. However, many within our administration have no desire to cede the land, citing they too spilled blood protecting this rightfully-American land, and they would be damned before they gave it up. With our hardliners itching for war and with Washington demanding we uphold our end of the deal, we are torn between duty and diplomacy. What shall we do?"
mexico_req.111.a:0 "We must obey Washington’s deal with Mexico City. Cede the land."
mexico_req.111.b:0 "This is rightfully American clay!"

mexico_req.12.t:0 "The Second Mexican-American War"
mexico_req.12.d:0 "Our refusal to accept the Mexican territorial claims after we fought and died together in the 2ACW was the last straw, and now we must pay the expected price. Mexico has already begun to consolidate its spread out forces into a new frontline, and Mexico City has already wired a declaration of war to Washington as we speak. We have held firm to this rightful clay, but have plunged our already war-ravaged nation into yet another conflict just moments after it had finished its last one. Now, troops of the National Guard, together with volunteers from the local population, are being mobilised to repel the initial Mexican assaults as the Second Mexican-American War springs to life!"
mexico_req.12.a:0 "All America shall know is war."

mexico_req.120.t:0 "Mexico Demands ‘Tejas’"
mexico_req.120.d:0 "Seeking to reclaim lost territories and undo the Mexican Cession, the Mexican government has sent a demand to our regime simply demanding the state of Texas. While most in our cabinet have laughed it off, for none are too keen on ceding our largest and richest state to a foreign nation. However, with the reality of our current war-efforts sinking in, many still do not wish to open up another front. We could try to call their bluff, possibly risking war with Mexico, or we could just simply cede ‘Tejas’ to them for now."
mexico_req.120.a:0 "It's Texas, not Tejas!"
mexico_req.120.b:0 "We must let ‘Tejas’ go for the good of the wider Union."

mexico_req.121.t:0 "The AUS Denies Our Territorial Demands"
mexico_req.121.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the Union State government has denied our demand for the return of Tejas, laughing in the face of our claim. This has left us with two simple options: either pack it up and give up our ambitions for Tejas for now, or we could march over the Rio Grande and take our rightful clay by force! What shall it be?"
mexico_req.121.a:0 "Then war it shall be!"
mexico_req.121.b:0 "They have called our bluff; back down."

mexico_req.13.t:0 "Propose the Treaty of Acapulco"
mexico_req.13.d:0 "We've successfully beaten back the Americans and occupied at least part of our rightful territory lost in the Mexican Cession. We can send their humiliated leadership a peace offer now and demand that they surrender any territory we claim and already control, or we can keep on fighting and hope we occupy even more land. However, with the Civil War developing as it is, it may not be wise for us to continue fighting in America, so perhaps it is time to just take what we can and walk away for now, letting the remaining Americans kill themselves without wasting Mexican blood."
mexico_req.13.a:0 "Sue for peace, the people and our soldiers have had enough!"
mexico_req.13.b:0 "We shall keep on fighting, for all our lost land will be ours!"

mexico_req.14.t:0 "The Mexicans Offer Peace"
mexico_req.14.d:0 "What a disaster! A good portion of the Southwestern States have been lost to the advancing Mexican Army, and with our current situation we are in no position to stop them. The Mexicans have offered us peace, asking to simply keep whatever claimed land they already control in exchange for a complete end to all hostilities. With their troops threatening to advance even deeper into the nation, this might be the time to begrudgingly accept our defeat and cede them the disputed territory."
mexico_req.14.a:0 "Accept their claims, we must end this war right now!"
mexico_req.14.b:0 "No compromise until we are marching down Mexico City!"

mexico_req.15.t:0 "Signing the Treaty of Acapulco"
mexico_req.15.d:0 "Signed at the Alamo Courthouse, both for reverence of our shared past and for the Mexican government to further humiliate the Americans, a new peace treaty - the Treaty of Acapulco - has been drafted and agreed upon by the Mexican and American delegation. According to the Treaty of Acapulco, the Americans have agreed to cede all Mexican-occupied land in the Southwest to Mexico itself - finally landing us the rightful payback for the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. Any of our territory held by the various American rebels will have to be taken at another time, but for now we have secured a vast swathe of our old land, and now we must organize it."
mexico_req.15.a:0 "Hooray!"

mexico_req.16.t:0 "Propose the Treaty of Acapulco"
mexico_req.16.d:0 "We've successfully beaten back the Americans and occupied at least part of our rightful territory lost in the Mexican Cession. We can send their humiliated leadership a peace offer now and demand that they surrender any territory we claim and already control, or we can keep on fighting and hope we occupy even more land. However, with the war going so well for us, we could just continue the push to finish this for good, though doing so would likely waste more innocent Mexican blood as we progress deeper into the American interior. What shall be done?"
mexico_req.16.a:0 "Sue for peace, the people and our soldiers have had enough!"
mexico_req.16.b:0 "We shall keep on fighting to the bitter end!"

mexico_req.17.t:0 "Peace offer from Mexico"
mexico_req.17.d:0 "What a disaster! A good portion of the Southwestern USA has been lost to the advancing Mexican Army, and our forces in the region have been decimated. Shockingly, the Mexicans have offered us peace, stating that they will take all of their claimed territory in either our or their control in exchange for a complete end to all hostilities. With their troops threatening to advance even deeper, perhaps this is finally the time to accept our defeat and cede them the disputed territory."
mexico_req.17.a:0 "Accept their offer. We cannot waste more American lives."
mexico_req.17.b:0 "Decline their offer. We will never abandon these Americans!"

mexico_req.18.t:0 "Signing the Treaty of Acapulco"
mexico_req.18.d:0 "Signed at the Alamo Courthouse, both for reverence of our shared past and for the Mexican government to further humiliate the Americans, a new peace treaty - the Treaty of Acapulco - has been drafted and agreed upon by the Mexican and American delegation. According to the Treaty of Acapulco, the Americans have agreed to cede all Mexican or Federally-occupied land in the Southwest that Mexico claims to Mexico itself - finally landing us the rightful payback for the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. Any of our territory held by the various American rebels will have to be taken at another time, but for now we have secured a vast swathe of our old land, and now we must organize it."
mexico_req.18.a:0 "Hooray!"

mexico_req.19.t:0 "The Americans Refuse"
mexico_req.19.d:0 "Spitting in the face of our good will, the Yanquis have denied our offer of peace, instead wishing to fight this war to the bitter end. If this is the death they so wish to face, we shall surely grant it to them. We ride for Washington!"
mexico_req.19.a:0 "Fools!"

mexico_req.27.t:0 "The United States Accepts Our Demands"
mexico_req.27.d:0 "Surprisingly, it seems that the Americans were willing to hand over all of the land they seized in the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, and with their decision, the Mexican Cession has finally been undone! Their internal problems must be brutal indeed for them to accept such a deal, but it matters not for us, for we Mexico has been made whole once more!"
mexico_req.27.a:0 "Our rightful northern lands were restored!"

mexico_req.28.t:0 "War Against the Pacific States?"
mexico_req.28.d:0 "Another rebel faction of the American Civil War, the Pacific States of America, currently control the Western Seaboard - a vast region that includes our rightful territories of Alta California. Though isolated, they have a strong military, a noble spirit, and an easily defensible swathe of territory. Should we march into our claimed lands here and take what is rightfully ours, or shall we just ignore this Western bastion, brushing it off as too much trouble to deal with."
mexico_req.28.a:0 "We march for San Francisco!"
mexico_req.28.b:0 "We have grown tired of this endless conflict. Ignore these lands."

mexico_req.29.t:0 "Victory Over the Pacific States"
mexico_req.29.d:0 "The Mexican army has overcome the armies of the Pacific States of America and are now in a position to demand their terms. Some in the government want the whole of California to be returned to Mexico but others feel that aggressive demands such as this will lead to another possible war in the future, or even more likely causing the deal to fall through. Instead, we could demand only the southern portion of Alta California, though that would leave much of our claimed land in enemy hands. Finally, we could just press forward with the war effort and throw diplomacy to the wayside, for it is not likely these Yanquis will agree anyway."
mexico_req.29.a:0 "Demand all of California"
mexico_req.29.b:0 "Demand the southern half of California"
mexico_req.29.c:0 "Continue the Offensive, the Pacific coast shall be ours"

mexico_req.30.t:0 "Mexico Demands All of California"
mexico_req.30.d:0 "The Mexicans have thoroughly beaten our forces, and now have come demanding the portion of their claimed ‘Alta California’ we have within our nation. Agreeing to these demands would end the bloodshed, but would require us to cede over half of our territory to a foreign government - a bitter pill to swallow by any margin. What shall be our reply?"
mexico_req.30.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
mexico_req.30.b:0 "No deal, we will fight to the end!"

mexico_req.31.t:0 "Mexico Demands Southern California"
mexico_req.31.d:0 "The Mexicans have thoroughly beaten our forces, and now have come demanding the portion of their claimed ‘Alta California’ we have within our nation. Agreeing to these demands would end the bloodshed, but would require us to cede over half of California and our southernmost holdings to a foreign government - a bitter pill to swallow by any margin. What shall be our reply?"
mexico_req.31.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
mexico_req.31.b:0 "No deal, we will fight to the end!"

mexico_req.32.t:0 "The PSA Accepts Our Demands"
mexico_req.32.d:0 "The PSA has seen reason and wisely has accepted our demands of California Cession. With their agreement, California has been returned to our control as well as the various southern holdings of the PSA. This is a great day for Mexico!"
mexico_req.32.a:0 "1848 has been avenged!"

mexico_req.33.t:0 "The PSA refuses our demands"
mexico_req.33.d:0 "The PSA has refused to accept our demands for Californian Cession, spitting in the face of our good will. Now, we must be forced to crush every last one of these West Coast Yanquis until every last inch of Alta California is once again under our control."
mexico_req.33.a:0 "We march for Sacramento!"

mexico_req.34.t:0 "PSA Troops Occupy Baja California"
mexico_req.34.d:0 "Under our direct order, loyal troops from bases in South California have crossed the border into Mexico and have occupied the Baja Peninsula. With our troops entrenched and poised to stab deeper into the heart of Mexico, we have Mexico City by the balls. In this position of power, now is the perfect opportunity for us to press our claims on the region while we sue for a peace settlement to our advantage. Alternatively, we could simply press this advantage and march to Mexico City itself to end this, though it's a long way there from Baja."
mexico_req.34.a:0 "Send a peace delegation immediately!"
mexico_req.34.b:0 "No peace until we're marching on Mexico City!"

mexico_req.35.t:0 "Peace Proposal from the Pacific States"
mexico_req.35.d:0 "In a brash act flagrantly flying in the face of our national sovereignty, troops from the Pacific States have crossed the border into Mexico and have occupied the Baja Peninsula! With their troops poised to advance deeper into our nation’s interior, they have seized the opportunity and sent envoys to negotiate a peace settlement that is most advantageous to them. Should we accept their claims to Baja California and end the conflict, or shall we fight back against these foreign invaders?"
mexico_req.35.a:0 "Accept their offer. It's only Baja."
mexico_req.35.b:0 "No peace until we're marching on Sacramento!"
mexico_req.35.c:0 "Continue the war, we will crush the PSA!"

mexico_req.590.t:0 "Arizona Revolts!"
mexico_req.590.d:0 "With Anglo tensions only rising and with the strength of the resistance only growing, it was only a matter of time before the Northern Territories fell victim to mass, organized rebellion. \n\nOne such rebellion has arisen in the old US state of Arizona, where a Libertarian-influenced but largely apolitical revolt has exploded, taking over key cities across the region such as Phoenix and Tucson already. Led by a mysterious former WCC aeronautics officer-turned-bandit only known to our intelligence office as ''The Man of Water and Gold'', this bandit lord and his gang of rough riders and miscreants have rallied much of Arizona’s Anglo population against us, and have even been able to sway some of the local American Indians to their side as well. We must crush this rebellion quickly before this folk hero gains too much popularity and power!"
mexico_req.590.a:0 "Goldwater’s Arizona shall be destroyed!"

mexico_req.591.t:0 "Utah Revolts!"
mexico_req.591.d:0 "With Anglo tensions only rising and with the strength of the resistance only growing, it was only a matter of time before the Northern Territories fell victim to mass, organized rebellion. \n\nOne such rebellion has arisen in the old US state of Utah, where a Mormon-influenced coalition known as the ‘Deseret Militia’ has risen up against our mandate, rousing the rest of the region’s Anglo population to do the same. Calling their new movement the New Nauvoo Legion, these Mormon militias and Anglo protestants have devolved into little more than a bandit army. We must crush these vile heretics quickly lest their taint infect all of the Northern Territories!"
mexico_req.591.a:0 "Crush these heretics!"

mexico_req.592.t:0 "California Revolts!"
mexico_req.592.d:0 "With Anglo tensions only rising and with the strength of the resistance only growing, it was only a matter of time before the Northern Territories fell victim to mass, organized rebellion. \n\nOne of the largest of these rebellions has been within the old US state of California, started by a big-tent coalition of various political groups and fueled by American military staff sent in from Washington to instigate rebellion. With various militias hailing from republican, socialist, nationalist, and other varied backgrounds, the diverse resistance movement succumbs to infighting almost as much as it does fight our own forces, but they are bound by their love of American Democracy and that dying nation’s so-called values. We will eradicate these vile rebels, and secure order over the Northern Territories once and for all!

##Army Generals##

ARMY_MEX_EMILIANO_ZAPATA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 8, in Anenecuilco, Morelos, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W Emiliano Zapata Salazar's military career began shortly after his political activism began, when he was forcefully conscripted into the 9th Cavalry regiment under Alfonso Pradillo in 1908, where he began experiencing the benefits and drawbacks of military life. With the Plan de San Luis going into effect and the death of Pablo Torres Burgos, Emiliano was chosen by the Southern Revolutionary Junta as the new revolutionary chief of the Southern Maderista Army. His first course of action was to take Cuautla from Porfirista forces, which was successful despite suffering heavy casualties. In order to increase recruitment, he promised every soldier who signed up with him a piece of arable land for themselves in exchange for their help in the revolution, and this tactic proved to be extremely successful with the disenfranchised peasants of the Mexican countryside."
ARMY_MEX_PANCHO_VILLA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 5, 1878, in San Juan del Rio, Durango, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W José Doroteo Arango Arámbula, better known by his pseudonym, Francisco Villa or his nickname 'Pancho Villa', has become a living legend for the people of Mexico. He started his adventure when Laureano Lopez Negrete, the owner of the Sombretillo Ranch where Doroteo worked, abused his older sister. In reprisal, he shot Laureano, and then evaded capture from the authorities, after which he escaped to the nearby mountains, where he was found by a gang of bandits lead by a man called Francisco Villa. He'd accompany the bandits for years, raiding and pillaging around Durango until Francisco Villa was shot in a firefight, and named Doroteo his succesor to lead the gang. Doroteo then adopted the name of his saviour, and continued his criminal activity. With the leadership of the gang secured, Villa decided to join forces with Ignacio Parra, and started his attempts to stop, sometimes violently, the abuses committed by the landlords to the peasants in Chihuahua. In the late 1910 he'd join the Movimiento Maderista, and through cunning and bravery, 'Pancho Villa' reached the higher ranks of the Mexican Revolutionary Army with the nickname 'The Centaur of the North', and even managed to shortly become Governor of Chihuahua. He'd anger the American government in 1916 after attacking the small town of Columbus in New Mexico, which lead to the Punitive Expedition led by John Pershing, who was never able to catch Villa despite all his efforts. Villa has since then played a major role in the Revolutionary army and Mexico's politics. He is a respected member of the General staff, although he's been seen lately dabbling more on politics than learning military strategy.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member and one of the main candidates of the Partido Nacional Agrarista."
ARMY_MEX_PLUTARCO_CALLES_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 25, 1877, in Guaynas, Sonora, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W Francisco Plutarco Elías Campuzano, born in an accomodated landlord family, graduated as a teacher in 1894 and dedicated to his teaching profession in Hermosillo and Guaynas, while trying to administrate the family business. When he moved to Agua Prieta, Governor José María Maytorena named him deputy. After the Decena Trágica, Calles began recruiting men from Agua Prieta to oppose Victoriano Huerta and in 1913 would join up the revolutionary forces to fight. Calles ended up under the direct orders of Alvaró Obregon, and became colonel and commander of Hermosillo by late 1913. In October of 1914, Calles successfully defended the city of Naco for three months, managing to hold against all odds, and due to this he was turned into Brigadier General by February 1915. With the success of the Plan de Agua Prieta and Obregon's rise to power, Calles became his second in command, and would become a vital member of the staff for years to come, although he has been seen dabbling more into politics in the recent years.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member and one of the main candidates of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario.\n-He has a very strict moral standard, and he sees both alcohol and religion as dangerous for the mind of both his soldiers and his people."
ARMY_MEX_JUAN_G_CABRAL_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W April 3, 1883, in Minas Prietas, Sonora, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W Juan German Cabral worked as miner before reaching his twenties, where he moved to Cananea, taking part of the 1906 general strike, where he met his future contacts for the Mexican Revolution. He was one of the first revolutionaries to take up arms against Porfirio Diaz and took part in several of the early battles of the revolution. In May 1911, he took Cananea and Naco, and due to this he was ascended to Cavalry Colonel by Francisco Madero himself. He would become Commander in February 1912, and in 1913 he'd join Victoriano Huerta's forces. He'd be then selected to carry out low risk operations and was generally chosen as military governor by Obregón as a more conciliatory man than his colleagues like Maytorena and Callés. He has since then taken part in several diplomatic missions to other South American countries, and remains a very respected member of the staff, even being known as 'The cleanest military man from the revolution'\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Apathetic to Politics."
ARMY_MEX_PABLO_QUIROGA_ESCAMILLA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 7, 1875, in Cienaga de Flores, Nuevo León, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W Pablo Quiroga Escamilla incorporated into the constitutionalist army in 1913, and was under the orders of Manuel M. Diéguez. With the Volunteer corp and the 13th Battalion of Lancers, Escamilla lead several expeditions in Sonora, Sinaloa, Nayarit and Jalisco. He assisted in the Battle of Santa Ros, the siege of Guaymas and fight for Oredáin. He was promoted to colonel in 1914, taking part in another series of operations in Silao y Trinidad, Guanajuato, Queretaro and Durango. In 1915 he was promoted to Brigadier General, and would take part in another 25 expeditions throughout the revolution and in the post-revolutionary era. While an experienced member of the general staff, he has been slowly but surely losing interest in his military career, and may be willing to resign soon enough."
ARMY_MEX_JOAQUIN_AMARO_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 16, 1889, in Sombrerete, Zacatecas, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W Joaquín Amaro Domínguez was born from a native family, and he was amongst the first revolutionaries from Michoacan to take up arms against the government. He was initially under the command of Gertrudis G. Sanchéz, but would continually switch sides during the revolution until joining the Army of Operations under the command of Álvaro Obregón. He was commendated for bravery at the Battle of Celaya. In 1916, he fought in Morelos and in Mexico City against the Zapatist forces, executing several civilians under the fear that they were gonna betray Obregon's troops. In 1918, he operated in Durango and Chihuahua against the Villistas, and in 1920 he joined the Plan de Agua Prieta, which catapulted him to the rank of Brigadier General. Since then he has been named Headmaster of military education at the Heroico Colegio Militar, and he has held his post since then, encouraging discipline and technical expertise over raw manpower, and propagated sports and cultural activities through popular libraries in the barracks.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- His relations with both Zapata and Villa are sour at best. Fighting against them in the revolution have made Joaquin very wary of his new colleagues."
ARMY_MEX_FRANCISCO_LUIS_URQUIZO_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 21, 1891, in San Pedro de las Colinas, Coahuila, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W Francisco Luis Urquizo Benavides joined the revolution in 1911 in Coahuila under the orders of Emilio Madero, where he'd later be assigned as one of Francisco Madero's personal guard, fighting alongside Madero in the Decena Tragica. With the death of Madero, Urquizo escaped from Mexico City and joined Carranza's forces, organizing a volunteer sapper battalion from fellow citizens of Coahuila. With his battalion, he was able to fight and capture Candela for Carranza, he'd take part in the capture of the Torreón and would assist in the attack on Monterrey Francisco Villa's Northern Division.
