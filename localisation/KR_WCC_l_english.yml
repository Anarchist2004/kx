### Parties ###
WCC_totalist_party: "Socialist Party of America"
WCC_totalist_party_long: "Socialist Party of America (Vanguardist) - §LThe military has identified a faction of the SPA, which they call the "Vanguardists", as one of the most threatening groups to the stability of the WCC. These hardliners want to drastically change society and the economy as well. Luckily, they are few and far between in the arid deserts, harsh plains, and towering mountains under our control. For now, it will suffice to stay vigilant.§!"
WCC_syndicalist_party: "Socialist Party of America"
WCC_syndicalist_party_long: "Socialist Party of America (IWW) - §LThe IWW has infiltrated our territory, and seems to be focusing on the small cities of the region, such as Phoenix, Boise, and Denver. Though we have been able to keep them relatively muted, we should make sure we maintain control of our urban centers, for losing those could spell disaster for our war effort.§!"
WCC_radical_socialist_party: "Socialist Party of America"
WCC_radical_socialist_party_long: "Socialist Party of America (Mutualist) - §LThe more moderate members of the SPA draw influence from both the so-called Nationalists in the CSA and Upton Sinclair's Commonwealth Party in the West. From the intel we can gather, it seems that their message is uniquely tailored to our region, typically with overtures to farmers and cattle ranchers. Their criticism of railroad companies and eastern banks could easily catch on in our rural areas, so we should do all we can to reassure our people that we represent their interests. A farmer's revolt could topple our regime...§!"
WCC_social_democrat_party: "Progressive Party"
WCC_social_democrat_party_long: "Progressive Party - §LThe Progressives in our territory support most of the same policies that Progressives elsewhere support; a social safety net, increased regulations against big business, and temperance. They lack the necessary qualities to keep stability in our vast territory, so for now, they are a party that we should keep an eye on. They are unlikely to cause trouble anytime soon, but if their fellow Progressives gain traction elsewhere, it is hard to say what could occur.§!"
WCC_social_liberal_party: "Democratic Party"
WCC_social_liberal_party_long: "Democratic Party (Reformist) - §LReform-minded Democrats are a small faction in the territory we control, but they do exist. They typically support greater education funding, social security, and some labor-friendly legislation. Our intelligence doesn't view this faction as one that will be particularly threatening, especially given their own divisions within the Democratic Party. However, if their Western allies, the Democratic-Republicans, gain power, it may embolden them to join their cause instead.§!"
WCC_market_liberal_party: "Republican Party"
WCC_market_liberal_party_long: "Republican Party - §LThe laissez-faire Republicans of the West are used to being in power, but this is obviously not the case anymore. As such, they might get the idea that they can have influence in our government, but we must maintain military rule. In the meantime, we should focus on overtures to supporters of this party, reminding them that we wish to return America to its old democracy. For the duration of the war, their policies cannot be implemented, but it would not be a bad idea to incorporate some of their policies into our own plans.§!"
WCC_social_conservative_party: "Democratic Party"
WCC_social_conservative_party_long: "Democratic Party (Conservatives) - §LThe Democratic Party has traditionally contested the West with the Republicans, but has typically been the weaker of the two in the area. However, former President Woodrow Wilson was fairly popular in the region for his support of non-intervention in the Weltkrieg, and this has kept the Democratic Party competitive in the region ever since. Now, facing a split, they are not as threatening as they might otherwise be, but we should take care to cultivate good relations with Democratic officials in our area. They could help to reassure our people and make sure they stay firmly under the control of the military. Perhaps we could even adopt some of their policies after the war, if they are cooperative.§!"
WCC_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Western Federalists"
WCC_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Western Federalist Faction - §LWestern Federalists are the main faction of the military that has been given jurisdiction over the Western states. Led primarily by Omar Bradley and Dwight D. Eisenhower, they are loyal to the United States, and ostensibly to MacArthur as well. For now, this alignment has been cemented, but there is certainly a potential for conflict should the USA prevail in the Civil War. Eisenhower is no fan of MacArthur, and Bradley's intentions are unclear. Should MacArthur decide to snub the leaders of the WCC after the war, and take sole power for himself, it is not outside the realm of imagination that further conflict would follow...§!"
WCC_paternal_autocrat_party: "Federalist Loyalist Faction"
WCC_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Federalist Loyalist Faction (Hardliners) - §LThis faction of the government is made up of those who support MacArthur as well as the USA, and will follow his orders in any circumstance. These Hardliners are known to get into bitter arguments with the ruling faction of the WCC about how to implement MacArthur's orders and whether his commands should be followed without question. Should MacArthur decide to flee to the WCC, these supporters will welcome him with open arms.§!"
WCC_national_populist_party: "NDWL"
WCC_national_populist_party_long: "National Democratic White League - §LThe NDWL, while not as powerful here as in the East, still holds influence in our territory. Our inteligence officials report that they have used anti-Chinese sentiments to rile up support, and this could make them dangerous. We should suppress the NDWL and its offshoots to ensure that we are not outflanked by racial appeals. Our position could depend on this effort.§!"

WCC_MAC_PARTY: "MacArthur Loyalists"
WCC_MAC_PARTY_long: "MacArthur Loyalists -§L Douglas MacArthur has fled the East, bringing his most fervent supporters with him. His experiences in the East have changed him somewhat, and he now rails against revolutionaries and reactionaries alike, promising to eradicate traitors to the United States once and for all. To do this, he hopes to use aggressive tactics that put our more numerous enemies on the backfoot. He is also suspicious of citizens within our own territory, and promises to watch them closely. Most of all, MacArthur's now-famous proclamation that "I Shall Return" has endeared him to our soldiers, and they support him without question. The only thing that stands between MacArthur and this goal now are armies of angry radicals trying to tear the nation apart. For his part, MacArthur couldn't think of a better way to use our ammunition.§!"

WCC_authoritarian_democrat_patriots_party: "The Patriot Party (Moderates)"
WCC_authoritarian_democrat_patriots_party_long: "The Patriot Party Moderates - §LThese are the more liberally minded politicians and supporters of the new Patriot Party. Such supporters enjoy the new power we possess over the country, but they also solemnly remember the old days of democracy, and promise to keep the dream going for years to come, however they can.§!"
WCC_paternal_autocrat_patriots_party: "The Patriot Party (Military Loyalists)"
WCC_paternal_autocrat_patriots_party_long: "The Patriot Party Loyalists - §LThese are the mainstream MacArthur supporters within the party. They are loyal to him and strongly believe in his ability to rule over the country over any others. Whether they can keep the country together during the process of rebuilding is yet to be seen.§!"
WCC_national_populist_patriots_party: "The Patriot Party (Ultranationalists)"
WCC_national_populist_patriots_party_long: "The Patriot Party Ultranationalists - §LThese party members have taken the word "patriot" to new heights. They are MacArthur's hardcore supporters, and will stop at nothing to restore order to the country. Advocating crackdowns or worse on those who disobey the new government, the ultranationalists seek a world where America, and America alone, is on top.§!"

### Leader Bios ###
USA_OMAR_BRADLEY_POLITICS_DESC: "Born in 1893 to an impoverished family, Omar Bradley grew up with a love for athletics and firearms. In fact, after a talented baseball career in high school, he was offered a spot in several professional teams, but he declined to pursue a future in the military. Bradley became a military instructor and eventually became acquainted with George Marshall, who described him as "quiet, unassuming, capable, with sound common sense". More recently, Bradley taught at West Point, then studied at the U.S. Army War College. Bradley has undergone a meteoric rise in rank in the various recent American crises; a shortage in the American military leadership means that he is one of the first men called upon to lead. His boss, George Marshall, once said that you could give Bradley a job and forget about it. Now though, he must perform the job of a lifetime: saving America from itself. Douglas MacArthur has assumed control of the country, and partly due to the animosity between the two men, partly due to his high rank, Bradley has been sent to lead Federal forces in the West. He will be assisted in this task by Dwight Eisenhower, a man who Bradley trusts and respects far more than MacArthur. This 'Western Command Center' will theoretically exist only so long as rebels exist; once they have are defeated, it will be reincorporated into the United States. However, if Douglas MacArthur fails to fulfill his promise of stepping down once the crisis is over, desperate measures may need to be taken to ensure the contiuation of democracy in America..."

POLITICS_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_DESC: "Born in 1890 to a family tracing its presence in America to the eighteenth-century, Dwight D. Eisenhower had an eventful childhood. He had many interests, but chief among them was a love for military history, inspired by his mother's history book collection. Eisenhower was eventually accepted into West Point, where he tried his hand at a variety of sports, though none would hold his love more than playing cards. Eisenhower met Omar Bradley, a man with whom he would develop a close friendship, at West Point, and the two have both progressed in the military since. Eisenhower's organizational abilities first shined in this period of his life, but they only became more apparent to all observers once he began to command men and units. He held the rank of major for sixteen years but continued gaining prestige and influence within the military, working with men such as George S. Patton, John J. Pershing, Fox Conner, Douglas MacArthur, and George Marshall. As for MacArthur, it seems that destiny, fate, or whatever else one decides to believe in has put these two men together. Eisenhower has served as one of MacArthur's top men, and though the two have had vehement disagreements, Eisenhower has downplayed that part of their relationship, noting that they have always had a good relationship. However, as the two fought over MacArthur's reaction to the Bonus March in 1932, so too have they fought over MacArthur's increasing involvement over politics. Eisenhower had publicly supported the Federal and MacArthurite lines, but they had argued behind the scenes. During the war, Ike was given joint control over Federal lands in the West with Omar Bradley as a general, a position he held even as enemies surrounded his men on all sides. Eisenhower worried that MacArthur would not relinquish his power once the Civil War was over, and it appears his fears were well founded. Despite this, Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower have restored democracy to America, though neither man fully trusts the government, and have kept some of their power in a bid to prevent future crises from emerging. Eisenhower is a war hero, and the American people love him; adults write adoring letters to him, and those who know him best challenge him to a game of bridge every so often. Children sing "I like Ike" on playgrounds and even the elderly have good things to say about him. For Eisenhower though, his work has only just begun."

WCC_civil_liberties: "Loyalty to America"
WCC_civil_liberties_desc: "The early 1930s was the era of loyalty to men over ideals. Haywood, Long, and even Macarthur accrued a sort of clique of allies that saw their leaders as above the law. Several Congressmen have come out to apologize for their statements made during the war."

WCC_a_more_perfect_union_desc: "The goal of the United States as an independent nation is to form a more perfect union of the people of the United States.

WCC_trial_of_american_companies_desc: "It is time for Congress to hear the testimony of the rebellious companies.

This would allow the government to prosecute individual shareholders as responsible for decisions made."
WCC_esmwt: "Fate of the Unions"

WCC_farming_subsidies: "Farming Subsidies"
WCC_farming_subsidies_desc: "It is necessary to subsidize farms for crops we are in need of, and paying farmers to terminate their fields of lost assets for products like tobacco we don't need right now, but want the skilled labour to still be available."
WCC_maritime_industry: "Maritime Industry"

Now that we are surrounded on two sides, we should quickly reorganize our resources and troops to prepare for a two-front war. This will not be easy men, but we fight a good fight."
WCC_scrap_what_we_can: "Scrap What We Can"
WCC_scrap_what_we_can_desc: "We don't have much in our barren lands. But, what can we find? An armaments factory here, a private airplane there. We should scrap together, and convert, everything we possibly can. Let nothing be spared in this war effort."
WCC_fortify_the_rockies: "Fortify the Rockies"
WCC_fortify_the_rockies_desc: "We are blessed with a significant geographical advantage: the Rockies. These mountains will shield us from our foes in the West or East, depending on which side we focus on first, and will bide us crucial time. Further, there is the possibility we could bleed our more numerous foes fighting over these mountains..."
WCC_protect_the_skies: "Protect the Blue Skies"
WCC_protect_the_skies_desc: "The sky on the plain is vast, open, and blue as far as the eye can see. We should never have it blocked out by enemy aircraft. If we want to avoid that, we need to invest in anti-air equipment and technology, so that we can shoot any enemy out of the sky. The sky is blue now, and it will remain that way."
WCC_build_what_we_can: "Build What We Can"
WCC_build_what_we_can_desc: "We can scrap together everything in this great land and we still wouldn't have enough. We should also try to build new equipment and factories, so that we can stand a chance against our better equipped enemies. This will require hard work on the part of our men and women, but we have no doubt that they will rise to the task."
WCC_native_appeals: "Native Appeals"
WCC_native_appeals_desc: "It has come to this. Yes, we have to reach out to Mormons if we want to win the war. No, we are not converting to Mormonism. But, they are a significant part of our population, and we should treat them as such. Let us appeal to this group and make sure they are just as committed to our war effort as anyone else."
WCC_civilian_relocation: "Civilian Relocation"
WCC_civilian_relocation_desc: "As a military state, we must relocate civilians away from our hubs and our border cities. This will hopefully spare them from the worst of the carnage and allow us greater flexibility in our actions."
WCC_entente_aid: "Entente Aid"
WCC_entente_aid_desc: "We need more help in this war. Canada has promised us certain aid should we need it, though we did not take their offer seriously at the time. Now we have no other choice. Let us reach out to Canada and see what they can give us. With their help, we may just win this war."
WCC_to_the_last_man: "To the Last Man"
WCC_to_the_last_man_desc: "If we want to win this war, we can't afford to let the enemy outnumber and outfight us. We will fight to the last man, or we may as well not fight at all. Rally to the flag men, and tomorrow, we shall retake our country!"
WCC_washingtonian_tactics: "Washingtonian Tactics"
WCC_washingtonian_tactics_desc: "As a relatively small force next to our enemies we have much to learn from Washingtonian tactics during the Revolutionary War. Appeals to his hit-and-run tactics alongside using disinformation is not only practical but inspiring to our mens morale."
WCC_counter_propaganda: "Counter-Propaganda"
WCC_counter_propaganda_desc: "With our opponents being so ideological in nature, we need to counter their ideological tactics with our own. Counter-Propaganda will focus on debunking their claims while reminding citizens of their duty to America, the legitimate government and military, and aim to go beyond our borders into enemy territory to weaken their stance while strengthening our own."
WCC_the_colorado: "Our Friend, The Colorado"
WCC_the_colorado_desc: "We must to use the natural defenses of our region to our advantage which, combined with our superior training, will create an insurmountable barrier for our enemies to overcome while allowing them to lose their edge in manpower and for our forces to move more quickly amongst each other."
WCC_recruit_as_we_go: "Recruiting As We Go"
WCC_recruit_as_we_go_desc: "As we expand into enemy territory which, in reality, is our American territory, we need to recruit locals into our army as professional soldiers, not militias. This will allow us build from our originally sparse territory and create a wave that will retake the whole nation."
WCC_vegas_revenue: "Vegas Revenue"
WCC_vegas_revenue_desc: "The military towns of Reno and Vegas have become rather profitable in their gambling and related operations. It appears the government could invest in these growing businesses and their nearby infrastructure, and use the profits to fund its various war efforts."
WCC_war_bonds: "Loyalist Bonds"
WCC_war_bonds_desc: "Bonds would go a far way in giving us much needed liquid funds for our war efforts while giving an opportunity to raise support for the cause. So buy your Liberty Bonds today citizen!"
WCC_copper: "Copper, Copper and Copper"
WCC_copper_desc: "While we may not have many resources on our bases, one exception is the copper available in Arizonia and Montana. Mining it through a newly created government corporation will bring us much needed resources."
WCC_american_pompey: "American Pompey"
WCC_american_pompey_desc: "Bradley has not only defeated the populists, but the tyrant MacArthur. The savior of the true Republic is he, and he will need to better organize and expand his administration now that he commands the entire United States."
WCC_fate_of_marshall: "Marshall's Soldiers"
WCC_fate_of_marshall_desc: "George Marshall was a mentor to many of our generals. They fought not for extremism, but for what they believed was the United States of America. Though they were wrong, we cannot fault them for having good intentions. Let us not forget though-the road to hell is paved with good intentions."
WCC_fate_of_macarthur: "MacArthur's Men"
WCC_fate_of_macarthur_desc: "The would-be tyrant MacArthur has lost the war, and now the time has come to decide what to do with his forces. While some may remain loyal to him, it's very likely they can be converted to our cause."
WCC_patton: "Patton's Boys"
WCC_patton_desc: "George S. Patton was part of the reactionary faction that rose up in the South during the Civil War. His cause was admirable, but they betrayed our country, and we must make sure they do not rise up again. To accomplish this, we will instill a sense of nationalism amongst the men who were once Patton's Boys, so that they will fight just as hard for the United States of America as they did for their own cause."
WCC_vet_affairs: "Veteran Administration Bureau"
WCC_vet_affairs_desc: "A state that depends so heavily on its military must take care of its soldiers when they come home. Veterans will be a large group of our people now, and many of them did not fight for us. Let us create the Veteran Administration Bureau, so that we can win veterans of all sides over to our side. Perhaps we can win their favor and, if we need them again someday, they will heed the call."
WCC_wfc: "War Finance Corporation"
WCC_wfc_desc: "Our top officials have advised us to create a "War Finance Corporation". This government-run corporation would give support to industries that are crucial for our war effort. It will also fund the banks that aid these industries. By creating this corporation, we can have more equipment than ever, and our war effort will last much longer than it would have otherwise."
WCC_ami: "Defense Logistics Agency"
WCC_ami_desc: "Our soldiers can fight, but our army needs to keep up with them. We need to get the munitions and supplies our factories produce to our men, and we need to get oil to our vehicles. To coordinate all this, we will create a new agency. The Defense Logistics Agency will make it possible to fight a two-front war on a large front if need be. Our logistics shall never fail us!"
WCC_pension_subsidies: "Pension Subsidies"
WCC_pension_subsidies_desc: "We could still do a better job of taking care of our veterans. Let us create nursing homes and other types of care for our elderly veterans, so that our soldiers know who we work for. We will also subsidize these veterans and help them live respectable lives in their waning days."
WCC_bureaucratic_justice: "Bureaucratic Justice"
WCC_bureaucratic_justice_desc: "Our government must do something to replace the old justice system of our country. Instead of assuming someone is innocent until proven guilty, would it not be more efficient to presume their guilt and put the onus on the defendant? This would allow us to resolve cases faster, and perhaps allow us to get rid of some of our enemies as well..."
WCC_entente_relations: "Entente Relations"
WCC_entente_relations_desc: "Canada, along with the rest of the Entente, has assisted us in various ways during the Second Civil War. We should pursue closer relations with them, as they are our natural ideological allies. They understand our concentration on our military, as well as our fundamental principles, better than any other nation. They are also our neighbors. If we must co-exist, let us be allies."
WCC_containment: "Containment"
WCC_containment_desc: "Our foreign policy advisors have developed a doctrine to combat the rise of syndicalism in the Western Hemisphere. This may also hamper the growth of left wing movements here as well. The doctrine will be called "Containment", and we will give aid to countries in danger of falling to left wing radicals, as well as work to cause tension within nations that have already fallen. Let America show her might on the world stage."
WCC_detente: "Detente"
WCC_the_fourth_branch: "Fourth Branch of Government"
WCC_the_fourth_branch_desc: "Some of our people have talked about a fourth branch of government for years. Now, there really will be a fourth branch. The military will be one of the main institutions of our government, and it will be as much of a pillar of it as the others are. Before long, it will likely be the only branch. Our people will never be unsafe again."
WCC_republican_traditions: "Republican Traditions"
WCC_republican_traditions_desc: "Our country was a republic since its inception. Things have changed since those days, but we will still retain many of our old republican traditions. Let us reassure our people that their liberty and their rights shall still be intact in our new society, as long as they do not interfere with our collective security."
WCC_the_wise_men: "The Wise Men"
WCC_the_wise_men_desc: "With military officials in charge of our country, we can run things far more efficiently. The military will receive the attention it needs, and it will be larger and better funded than ever before. Our "Wise Men" sit at the top of it all and direct our men like pieces on a chess board. America will be a warrior society, more than Sparta, Rome, or Germany ever were."
WCC_think_tanks: "Think Tanks"
WCC_think_tanks_desc: "There have been many political think tanks in our country in past decades, and this has inspired us to create think tanks for the military as well. These think tanks will serve as the foremost research institutions in North America for military technology and strategy. We will be one of the most advanced armies in the world, and one day we shall even outmatch the Germans."
WCC_institute_for_advanced_study: "Institute for Advanced Study"
WCC_institute_for_advanced_study_desc: "We will create a hub for further research within our nation, so that our military can become the dominant force in our hemisphere and perhaps the world. We will also put a special emphasis on marines, mountaineers, and other special forces that we could use in a large variety of terrain."
WCC_american_finance_corporation: "Bank for Reconstruction and Development"
WCC_american_finance_corporation_desc: "Many of our areas are still devastated by the war. One idea to help reconstruction efforts is to create the B.R.D., which will give loans to the most devastated areas of our country. This will help them rebuild and recover from the conflict. We will also give loans to developping areas and states, so that they can become more prosperous than ever before."
WCC_restore_wall_street: "Restore Wall Street"
WCC_restore_wall_street_desc: "Before the Civil War, Wall Street was an important financial institution in our country. We should restore it, so that New York can become a global economic hub once again. 
WCC_i_shall_return: "I Shall Return"
WCC_i_shall_return_desc: "MacArthur has come to us beaten and bloodied. But, he is not broken. In fact, his resolve has never been stronger. Despite that, he has come to us a changed man. Wildly decrying revolutionaries and reactionaries, he speaks of our American identity, rallying our people to massacre those who have betrayed our country. Though we don't have much, we will use what we have to beat the traitors once and for all."
WCC_intensive_training: "Intensive Training"
WCC_intensive_training_desc: "One lesson MacArthur has taken away from his time in the East is that our soldiers need more training. He now insists we train them as much as humanly possible and push them to new levels, so that they will be unmatched in the battlefield. He will not be beaten twice."
WCC_advanced_security_forces: "Advanced Security Forces"
WCC_advanced_security_forces_desc: "Since MacArthur has arrived, it has been clear to everyone that he has become a very paranoid man. He is paranoid for good reason, though, given the state of our country. He demands the creation of new American security forces, specializing in special operations, in order to carry out any tasks he sees fit to bring order back to America. Some have whispered about the creation of a secret police force, but those dissenters are quickly silenced."
WCC_civilian_takeover: "Civilian Contributions"
WCC_civilian_takeover_desc: "Though MacArthur is humble enough to admit his own faults, he also blames the American people for not being committed enough to the war effort. We will conscript more men than ever before, and the people will be put to work. All will be sacrificed for our country, for without our country, we are nothing."
WCC_constitutional_amending: "Improve the Constitution"
WCC_guerilla_tactics: "Guerilla Tactics"
WCC_guerilla_tactics_desc: "MacArthur became convinced of the effectiveness of guerilla tactics in his time in the East. If we can catch our enemy off guard, it does not matter if they outnumber us; we will destroy them all the same. We will utilize quick, silent strikes and disappear before the enemy even has a chance to react."
WCC_central_bureau: "Central Bureau"
WCC_central_bureau_desc: "At MacArthur's request, we have created a new "Central Bureau" to assist us in managing military affiars. It will be used as an intelligence service and as a tool to help us pursue aggressive warfare against our enemies. We will no longer be on the back foot-we will take the fight to our enemies!"
WCC_army_first: "Army First"
WCC_army_first_desc: "MacArthur knows he wouldn't last long without the loyalty of the army. He has made an effort to put them first in every move and decision he makes. From food rations to clothes to payment, the soldiers are served first, and in return they are expected to show the utmost loyalty. Most of them do. His soldiers worship him like a god, and he plans to use their fanaticism to his advantage, against enemies within and without."
WCC_the_watchmen: "The Watchmen"
WCC_the_watchmen_desc: "We have created a new paramilitary force of sorts, called the Watchmen. These are civilians who have agreed to spy on our citizens for us, for many reasons. Chief among them is the desire to keep MacArthur safe and to find any potential rivals or enemies within our country. We cannot risk betrayal, not now. Every effort will be taken to silence critics and get rid of traitors."
WCC_mobile_state: "The Mobile State"
WCC_mobile_state_desc: "Speed and aggression are tactics that MacArthur insists we make key pillars of our military. If we want to win wars, we have to strike our enemies before they have the chance to surround us, a fate he himself has experienced before. This time we will surround the enemy and force them to surrender with lightning speed."
WCC_address_congress: "Address Congress"
WCC_address_congress_desc: "As much as he embraces the term Caesar, MacArthur has no intentions of sharing the fate of his namesake. He has installed loyal men in Congress, and these men have made his case to the American people even better than he as one man ever could. MacArthur is more popular than ever, and the country is in his tight grip."
WCC_strangle_the_cobra: "Strangle the Cobra"
WCC_strangle_the_cobra_desc: "Now that we have prevailed over American syndicalism, we should look to the south. Latin America harbors syndicalist snakes still, and we must be wary of them if we are to survive and prosper. They cannot be allowed to continue to exist, for their presence will encourage radicals in our own country. Let us eliminate them."
WCC_nuclear_program: "Nuclear Program"
WCC_nuclear_program_desc: "A few of our top scientists have privately suggested a nuclear weapons program to MacArthur. Such a weapon is still unknown and untested, and there are many who dismiss it and instead insist we focus on bomb production. MacArthur has been convinced, however, and has given the scientists the green light to proceed with this projet. The future is unknown, but we know one thing: it is ours to take."
WCC_dissident_fate: "Dissident Fates"
WCC_dissident_fate_desc: "MacArthur is sick of dealing with dissidents in his country. He has been criticized from every side, and now he is taking action to make sure it never happens again. The military and homewatch organizations will round up dissidents and send them to military camps, where they will spend their days doing hard labor for our country. With their help, we will not lose."

### Navy Path ###
WCC_navy: "American Navy"
WCC_navy_desc: "Only a few ships, and even fewer sailors, remained loyal to the American people. We need to take stock of our maritime situation."
WCC_great_white_fleet: "Great White Fleet"
WCC_great_white_fleet_desc: "The Great White Fleet was the height to American naval power. We should look back at it for inspiration. A great fleet of battleships and dreadnoughts will ensure we always have naval superiority."
WCC_protect_american_trade: "Protect American Trade"
WCC_protect_american_trade_desc: "Trade is the lifeblood of America. We should focus our naval doctrine on making sure that it is protected from enemy raids."
WCC_carriers: "Carrier Fleet Project"
WCC_carriers_desc: "Carriers are the wave of the future. We should invest in their research and construction to better project naval power."

WCC_light_cruisers: "Light Cruiser Development"
WCC_light_cruisers_desc: "Lighter cruisers are important in anti-air operations, as well as attacking enemy destroyers and submarines. We should ensure our navy has a handful of these in order to stay balanced."
WCC_naval_aviation: "Naval Aviation"
WCC_naval_aviation_desc: "Naval aviation is the future of warfare on the high seas. We should ensure that our air designs are capable of being launched from carriers and destroying the enemy fleet without even endangering our own."
WCC_expand_dockyards: "Expand Dockyards"
WCC_expand_dockyards_desc: "Our dockyards are somewhat inadequate to fight a war on their own. We need to ensure that new naval production facilities are constructed to support the war effort."
WCC_submarine_development: "Submarine Development"
WCC_submarine_development_desc: "Submarines allow us to wreak havoc on enemy shipping and heavy ships. We should ensure that our designs stay up to date against enemy destroyers and anti-submarine tactics."
WCC_liberty_ships: "Liberty Ships"
WCC_liberty_ships_desc: "Our shipyards, previously dedicated to commercial shipping, can easily be converted to produce massive numbers of convoys to supply our allies around the world."
WCC_maritime_industry: "Maritime Industry"
WCC_maritime_industry_desc: "Our maritime tradition remains strong. We can leverage the commercial shipping industry to help our struggling democracy to survive."
WCC_new_admirals: "New Admirals"
WCC_new_admirals_desc: "Many admirals deserted to the traitors to the east. We should train a new generation of naval leaders to ensure our continued maritime dominance."
WCC_life_at_sea: "Expand the WAVEs"
WCC_life_at_sea_desc: "Women can serve many auxiliary roles in the navy, freeing up men for combat duty. While this might be socially controversial, it will significantly help the war effort."
WCC_marine_corps: "Expand Marine Corps"
WCC_marine_corps_desc: "The Marine Corps was the epitome of American power projection around the globe. From the shores of Tripoli to the halls of Montezuma, the Marines were always there. We should ensure they have modern equipment and training."
WCC_naval_training: "Naval Training"
WCC_naval_training_desc: "While the Naval Academy in Annapolis was destroyed in the fighting of the Civil War, we still have plenty of facilities able to train a new generation of naval leaders and sailors."
WCC_urban_warfare: "Urban Warfare Training"

WCC_air_force_reform: "Formation of an American Air Force"
WCC_air_force_reform_desc: "With the ongoing debate in the WCC Army, the air WCC officers that defected to our side have promised us great results if we separated the air branch from the army. The Western Command Air Force shall be formed, and will have to decide it's future plans."
WCC_expand_ACTS: "Expand the Air Corps Tactical School"
WCC_expand_ACTS_desc: "We are lucky enough that the American Army in the past relegated air officer training to the deep South, as we now possess access to the installations and officers from the Air Corps Tactical School in Maxwell Field, Alabama. However, in order to surpass the School set up in Langley Field in Virginia, we will need to expand on our installations."
WCC_fighters: "Fighter Development"
WCC_fighters_desc: "American fighter projects were halted during the 1920s due to a lack of funding from the government, leading to a disadvantage in fighter development. We must close this gap by funding design contests among different companies with the prize being obtaining a very profitable production contract for the plane that may outperform our enemy's."
WCC_le_may_reform: "LeMay Reform Plan"
WCC_le_may_reform_desc: "Curtis LeMay has proposed a bold plan of reform. Since the Air Force isn't meant to complement the army, he has proposed that the air force should strike at the heart of our enemies and cripple their industries of war. While his theoretical approach is sound, the final decision rests with the government."
WCC_air_field_expansion: "Air Field Expansion"
WCC_air_field_expansion_desc: "Part of LeMay's plan involves developing new air fields, as well as expanding existing ones. This will allow us greater capacity for air missions, and may assist with training as well. Better air infrastructure will give our airplanes a better chance in our wars."
WCC_naval_bombers: "Naval Bomber Development"
WCC_naval_bombers_desc: "With the shortcomings of our navy for protecting our shores, the air force has the duty to also protect the shores of our nation for whatever cost against any enemy who dare set foot in our homeland. As such, we will seek to complement the Navy's patrols with naval bombers scouting and intercepting any vessels whenever our fleet is too spread out or too far away to do so."WCC_bombers: "Bomber Development"
WCC_bombers: "Bomber Development"
WCC_bombers_desc: " Bombers, although a terror to behold, will enable us to project our power overseas. Our secret project also hinges on effective and safe bombers to deliver their secret payload."
WCC_radar: "R.A.D.A.R. Development"
WCC_radar_desc: "RADAR, the top-secret technology to detect air movement will allow our sky watchers to rest easy at night."
WCC_screaming_eagles: "'Screaming Eagles' Program"
WCC_screaming_eagles_desc: "With the ever growing presence of our air force and ever growing needs of the battlefield, a question has arisen between our army and air force officers: Could it be possible to combine the two to transport troops behind the battlefield in a manner that may change the face of the battle? In order to prove or disprove this theory, an experiment shall be undertaken."
WCC_rule_the_skies: "Rule the Skies"
WCC_rule_the_skies_desc: "Off we go, into the wild blue yonder, flying high into the sky. Our Air Force shall be the world's most advanced, and nowhere will be out of our reach."
WCC_strat_bomber_development: "Strategic Bomber Development"

WCC_bomb_em_back_to_the_stone_age_desc: "One our Bombers are done with our enemies, they won’t be able to tell the difference between their land and primitive rocks. All of our enemies will be reduced to rubble!"
WCC_long_range_interceptors: "Long Range Interceptors"
WCC_long_range_interceptors_desc: "While fighters can secure the skies above the battlefields, the battle at the enemy's doorstep is usually too far away for them to step in to protect our bomber wings from the enemy fighters. To counter this, we have managed to create and improve heavier designs with longer to have bigger agility to stand a chance in air-to-air combat, and further investment in this area may yield great benefits."

### Reconstruction ###
WCC_stunning_victory: "A Stunning Victory"
WCC_stunning_victory_desc: "The Civil War is over, and we have emerged as the sole continuation of the United States of America. Nobody expected that the Western Federalists would take over on their own, and yet, they hve managed to do so.Though many traitors remain free and fundamental issues remain in our society, we can now begin the work of restoring the country. "
WCC_martial_law: "Martial Law"
WCC_martial_law_desc: "The country is in a great state of disorder after the recent Civil War, and it is up to us to restore stability. We must declare Martial Law until the rebels are fully extinguished, for there are still terrorists who dare to plague our nation, and they will be dealt with."
WCC_destroy_afl: "Punish Unions"
WCC_destroy_afl_desc: "The AFL was one of the traitorous unions that betrayed America during the Civil War. We must make an example of them, while also holding up loyal unions as examples. Without their sabotage, our economy will be on the road to prosperity!"
WCC_rockefeller_traitors: "Punish the Wealthy"
WCC_rockefeller_traitors_desc: "The Rockefellers betrayed our country when they fled to New England. They must be punished and made into an example. New England was not willing to pay the cost of sparing them, and now they are in our hands. We could confiscate their wealth, throw them in prison, or execute them, and if we are ambitious, we can do all three."
WCC_wisemen: "Wisemen in the White House"
WCC_wisemen_desc: "Omar Bradley and Dwight D. Eisenhower have led the country to victory against both dangerous radicals and powerhungry tyrants, and now stand poised to restore American democracy. However, it has quickly become clear to all outside observers that this government will have be different, and the military will have a crucial role, with both men skeptical that the government could restore order without their involvement." 
WCC_mac_trial: "Trial of MacArthurites "
WCC_mac_trial_desc: "Douglas MacArthur and his men have done more damage to this country than perhaps any other faction did during the Civil War. The other factions may have been extremists, but they fought for what they thought was right. They did not make naked grabs at power like MacArthur did. It is time we end the greatest threat to democracy in our history, once and for all."
WCC_condemn_tyranny: "Condemn Tyranny"
WCC_condemn_tyranny_desc: "With MacArthur and his supporters dead or otherwise dealt with, we can now focus on the precedents he set and the legacy he has left. We must ensure that the next generation does not take the wrong lessons from his misdeeds; we must condemn tyranny."
WCC_suppress_radicals: "Suppress Radicals"
WCC_suppress_radicals_desc: "The most dangerous rebels and terrorists are those who belong to radical factions; they are the most likely to resort to violence to accomplish their goals, and they will stop at nothing to see our government fail. It will not be an easy task to suppress them, but we must accomplish this nonetheless if we wish to ultimately stabilize the country. "
WCC_court_moderates: "Court Moderates"
WCC_court_moderates_desc: "The considerable damage done in the Civil War cannot be mended unless we have the American people on our side. We should aim to court those who fear extremism as much as we do, for as much as the military is our tool, we must also rely on the civilian populace to keep the peace."
WCC_brain_trusts: "The Brain Trust"
WCC_brain_trusts_desc: "We are military men first and foremost, but we do not have the necessary expertise to govern a country, much less guide it through the recovery. Therefore, the best plan of action would be to create new brain trusts, made up of the brightest Americans we can find. These loyal citizens will help restore the country and launch us into the future!"
WCC_restore_politicians: "Restore Politicians"
WCC_restore_politicians_desc: "Politicians are partly responsible for getting us into this mess, and yet we have made strange bedfellows out of them. When MacArthur tried to seize power for himself, Congress entrusted us with the future of America, and we will not forget our promises to them. We must restore democracy, of a sort..."
WCC_expand_wisemen: "Expanding the Wise Men"
WCC_expand_wisemen_desc: "Thus far, the wise men have been solely military men, but it is time to recruit loyal men and women from the vast civilian population as well, whether it be the political sphere or leaders from other factions. Many candidates are being considered, and now we must decide who we allow into our administration. We must take care to ensure that these individuals are loyal to our new government, however."
WCC_military_industrial_complex: "Military Industrial Complex"
WCC_military_industrial_complex_desc: "The civil war has blasted our country to pieces. It is ironic, then, that the best way to rebuild will be through growing the military infrastructure that helped cause this destruction. It is undeniable though; we can create millions of new jobs working in the new military industrial complex."
WCC_side_with_capital: "Side with Capital"
WCC_side_with_capital_desc: "The American worker has betrayed this country, but it is not their fault. Traitorous unions poisoned their minds and turned them against their bosses, only to have the union take their money instead.

WCC_natpop_mac: "Down with the Traitors!"
WCC_natpop_mac_desc: "At great cost and against all odds, MacArthur and his men have prevailed in the Civil War. Their shocking recovery from the Washington retreat makes their feat all the more impressive, but MacArthur has come out of the war a changed man, and all eyes are on him to see how he will lead the country moving forward. All indicators show that he fully intends to stay in power, and most advisors believe he will push the country as hard as he pushes his men. As for traitors, well, it is a bad time to be a traitor..."
WCC_civilian_allies: "Civilian Allies"
WCC_civilian_allies_desc: "MacArthur is aware that the military cannot run the entire United States by itself. As a result, he has attempted to court some of the old politicians, scientists, adminstrators, and others who still hold sway in their states and in some cases, the national stage. With their help, we can crush future rebellions in their infancy..."
WCC_price_of_rebellion: "The Price of Rebellion"
WCC_price_of_rebellion_desc: "MacArthur was repeatedly humiliated during the war when he was personally forced to go from town to town and beg for money and even food for his men. As such, we have created a new tributary system, in which rebel populations give up 50% of their money, food, or supplies, based on MacArthur's judgement. We will never be humiliated again!"
WCC_traitors_everywhere: "Traitors Everywhere"
WCC_traitors_everywhere_desc: "When Washington fell, MacArthur barely escaped with his life.

### Events - ###

wcc.1.t: "Western Command Center Requests Aid"
wcc.1.d: "In the United States, an outpost made up of Federalist Forces trapped in the West under General Omar Bradley is fighting a desperate fight for survival. They are now requesting aid from the entente in their fight against populism, socialism and the Pacific. Unlike the more ambiguously friendly MacArthur and Pacific States the WCC leadership seems far more respectful to the Entente and particularly Canada, and many of our advisors believe their survival would be in our best interests. Of course as others believe them to be a lost cause they recommend we do not loan them firearms, funds and small grouping of 'Independent Volunteers' as it would only antagonize a victorious faction."
wcc.1.a: "We must aid them"
wcc.1.b: "No, they are doomed anyways"

wcc.2.t: "Canada Sends Aid"
wcc.2.d: "It appears our diplomatic mission has paid off, with the WCC seemingly being the best ally Canada to choose in the war. Of course, there is no guarantee they are not going to aid other factions to hedge their bets, but at least we have the aid we need."
wcc.2.a: "Fantastic"

wcc.3.t: "Canada Refuses Aid"
wcc.3.d: "Our mission to Canada has failed! They appear to not believe we are capable of winning the war and, as such, have refused to support us."
wcc.3.a: "Bastards"

wcc.4.t: "Fate of PSA Generals"
wcc.4.d: "With the PSA having fallen to us, it is time to decide the fate of imprisoned members of their cause. Many are sympathetic to their desire to protect democracy though none will defend what they consider a rash decision to declare war on the federal government and nearly doom America to extremist ideologies that deny modern freedom. Nonetheless, we most would have their soldiers and officers rejoin America if they swear loyalty to the federal government, although doing the opposite will make allow a firmer grip of the West even if it will anger some officers."
wcc.4.a: "Conditional Amnesty it is"
wcc.4.b: "We can not forgive their treason"

wcc.5.t: "What of MacArthurists?"
wcc.5.d: "While we were willing to fight under MacArthur when it seemed the only means of defending Congress from the Red Guard, the Minutemen, the NDWL, the seccessionists and an impractical and hypocritical Pacific Congress that sought to overide the national government with its own, it became clear in time that MacArthur was not willing to give up power to either Congress, Eisenhower or Bradley and he would have to go. Now with MacArthur having fallen we must decide whether to offer him full amnety, revive his reputation and gain his mens support or end the threat once and for all."
wcc.5.a: "Make MacArthur a General"
wcc.5.b: "Declare him a traitor"

wcc.6.t: "The Fallen Cause"
wcc.6.d: "The South has been felled once again, along with all of the generals whom either agreed with the Old Democrat agenda or had the misfortune of already serving their states when the war started. General Patton was their most prominent leader and many would have us offer him and his men amnesty while maintaining the NDWL as a terrorist organization. However, most others view their cause as beyond redemption and claim that we would be repeating the error of the First Reconstruction in going too easy on the radical white league allies, and as such it will be a bit of an uphill battle to offer them amnesty and ruffle some feathers. Of course, to jail them would mean dealing with the potential backlash."
wcc.6.a: "Conditional Amnesty"
wcc.6.b: "We must finish their cause"

wcc.6999.t: "American Standoff"
wcc.6999.d: "With our foes having been felled in the war, the USA and the WCC are the only combatants left standing. However, there is new tension between them, as the Bradley-Eisenhower circle are nervous of giving MacArthur unchecked power and are hostile to his perceived egomania. The two have insisted that MacArthur fulfill his promise of restoring democracy, holding a special election for the executive seat in two months time. If he does not, they say, they will be forced to take action themselves. This turn of events has infuriated MacArthur, who insists that they answer to him, not the other way around. Bradley and Eisenhower could easily be branded as traitors should their words become public knowledge, and a quick war would cement MacArthur's dominance. On the other hand, MacArthur believes that the two men could be swayed to his side if he were to make a deal with them. This would spare thousands of American lives and guarantee MacArthur's position, but the details of such a deal are unclear for now. What should we do?"
wcc.6999.a: "Offer to negotiate..."
wcc.6999.b: "Brand them as traitors!"
wcc.6999.c: "MacArthur steps down to fulfill his promise, though not for them!"

wcc.7.t: "A Secret Proposal"
wcc.7.d: "With our foes having been felled in the war, the USA and the WCC are the only combatants left standing. We have demanded that MacArthur give up power in two months time, yet his reply surprised Eisenhower and Bradley. In a personal letter to each of them, MacArthur proposed a deal between the three of them to share power within a wider military council, made up of the top brass of the U.S. military. In this scheme, Eisenhower would have a near-automous military government overseeing the reconstruction of the former AUS territories, while Bradley's army would essentially govern the WCC and Pacific States. While MacArthur would still be the face of the regime, this would prevent him from having a total handle on the situation. While some generals consider this treachery, taking the deal could save lives, and Eisenhower and Bradley reason that perhaps more power would allow them to slowly overtake MacArthur and someday restore demoracy. Of course, declining the deal would certainly lead to war, and in that case we should reach out to anyone we can..."
wcc.7.a: "Accept his offer."
wcc.7.b: "Seek allies against MacArthur"
wcc.7.c: "This is outrageous, attack!"

wcc.7001.t: "Congress flocks to the West"
wcc.7001.d: "Dwight Eisenhower and Omar Bradley are becomingly increasingly anxious in observation of MacArthur in the East. It seems that he has no intention of giving up sole power, and members of the old civilian government are fleeing to us in the hopes that we will keep our promises of restoring democracy. A few veterans from various other factions have also joined our side, seeing us as the last hope of preventing a MacArthur dictatorship. Though their loyalty is questionable, we need all the manpower we can get. Our government has of course accepted both groups, but their combined presence has had a somewhat negative impact on our organization. Still, we may now have the manpower we need, and they urge us to move against MacArthur as soon as possible, before he can marshal the resources of the East against us. More and more, it seems like new battle lines are being drawn instead of the end to the Civil War that we had hoped for."
wcc.7001.a: "He leaves us with no choice..."

wcc.7002.t: "Our Next Move?"
wcc.7002.d: "MacArthur has sent his proposal to Eisenhower and Bradley in the WCC, but no answer has come in return. Most of the civilian government has now fled West to their open arms, in a seeming recognition of their authority over MacArthur's. To make matters worse, veterans from all different sides of the Civil War are also joining the ranks of the two men in what seems like a bid to stop MacArthur at all costs. The WCC, with the weight of the nation's politicians and new men in their ranks, could possibly defeat us. If so, MacArthur would lose everything, possibly his own life. Some of his adivsors quietly advise MacArthur to give into the pressure and agree to step down while he still can. A prideful man, MacArthur is angrier now than he was before, and with his men convinced that they have been betrayed, he believes he has what he needs to win an outright war. The way he sees it, he is left with little choice."
wcc.7002.a: "Hold an open election for MacArthur's replacement"
wcc.7002.b: "Alea Iacta Est..."

wcc.8.t: "WCC Demands!"
wcc.8.d: "The WCC has always had a tense relationship with MacArthur due to the generals leading it, Eisenhower and Bradley, having more loyalty to the Federal Government, Military, and Congress than to him, whom they distrust and view as an egomaniac. Now the tensions have come to a head, as they demand we relinquish some power in return for being re-annexed into the US. This deal would institute a ruling military council or committee, with MacArthur, Bradley, and Eisenhower as the main figures. Though MacArthur would lose his position at the top of the country, he would still retain significant power and a vast swath of the United States. If we do not sign the deal, we could face another war, one that we could lose. For now, this is the logical course."
wcc.8.a: "Very Well"

wcc.9.t: "MacArthur Accepts!"
wcc.9.d: "MacArthur has accepted our terms for peaceful reunifications and as such we have both prevented a potential tyranny and reunited America."
wcc.9.a: "God Bless America"

wcc.7014.t: "Do we reintegrate?"
wcc.7014.d: "MacArthur has stepped down, as promised, but we should decide whether we want to accept this move or not. Do we accept him stepping down, or take power to ensure security?"
wcc.7014.a: "Lets reintegrate"
wcc.7014.b: "Nah"

wcc.10.t: "WCC Reintegrates"
wcc.10.d: "Bradley and Eisenhower have acknowledged their lower rank to MacArthur and the United States, agreeing to hand over the WCC to him since he has agreed to hold elections, as promised. This is a relief, as they are known to have a tense relationship with MacArthur, making this a major victory for democracy and the battered nation. Of course, we should celebrate their actions and give them the highest honors we can to make the transition smoother."
wcc.10.a: "America is Saved!"
wcc.10.b: "Eh, lets go to war anyways..."

wcc.11.t: "MacArthur Assumes Command!"
wcc.11.d: "General MacArthur has decided he can no longer hold the East and now desires to move his outpost West, where we enjoy superior natural defenses. Of course, privately our leadership is not enthusiastic about this given Eisenhower and Bradley have a tense relationship with the General of the Armies and do not look forward to serving under him, especially given that MacArthur's faction and support base in the West are quite radical and now are even moreso after MacArthur sent word D.C. may be lost. However, our resources are few and that same faction could cause problems if we refuse, something we can not afford, so it appears we have little choice but to give in. Of course, rejecting him would be essentially a declaration of war as it would be a refusal to recognize his authority."
wcc.11.a: "Welcome him"
wcc.11.b: "Refuse him"

wcc.1101.t: "MacArthur's Speech"
wcc.1101.d: "Welcome to the Rockies Gentlemen! I will not lie, your chances of survival are small, some may even turn against your friends as traitors, but you have my word that I will use my power to assure that your bodies are given a proper burial as heroes, this is the greatest reward, more than even Money, for the fate of America is an eternal concern! Now come! Follow Me! Strike down the Traitors that rise against us! I ask not for my own selfish titles, but for the good of the nation!"
wcc.1101.a: "For America!"

wcc.12.t: "WCC Welcomes Us!"
wcc.12.d: "The WCC has welcomed us to the West! As such we are preparing our expedition West, likely cutting through a neutral or friendly nation to reach it. Of course, with the situation now increasingly dire MacArthur's radical supporters in the West, nicknamed ' Radical Federalists' have put forward an extreme proposal to save America from the subversive extremists who threaten it and, in the process, us. Already, George Kenney and Richard K. Sutherland have joined them, necessitating MacArthur's reliance on them."
wcc.12.a: "We shall not fail"

wcc.13.t: "America Restored"
wcc.13.d: "Against all odds, we have not only survived, but thrived. The Western Command Center had relinquished all traitors and secured a better future for America, and now we can finally end the period of reconstruction. The United States has been restored and old glory now proudly flies over Washington. And everyone knows that the Military and President [WCC.GetLeader] will keep the nation safe. "
wcc.13.a: "God Bless America"

wcc.14.t: "Appointing Lippmann"
wcc.14.d: "Journalist Walter Lippman is a strong supporter of our recent policies, believing our government places pragmatism, specialization and technocratic merits above ideology, and as such he has recently risen to be the lead editor of the New Republic. His position on the responsibility of the intellectual elite to herd the masses into contentment has resulted in some of the Wise Men believing we should place him in charge of overhauling our journalistic education system wholesale in favor of 'Lippmannism', and expect media outlets to meet its qualifications or not be designated as accurate media by the government and our connections."
wcc.14.a: "Empower Lippmann"
wcc.14.b: "He's fine where he is"

wcc.15.t: "Cultivating Ties"
wcc.15.d: "What the Wise Men are willing to acknowledge is that the masses are no longer capable of mass democracy as we've known it, as it will only cause death, destruction and collapse. However, this does not mean we need to brutally subjugate them either. We must cultivate ties to the elite classes on the basis of their expertise, not on birthright. As such, we should attempt to place a higher emphasis on meritocracy in our government, with those qualify becoming new members of the political elite who still value science and liberalism. In the process we must shake up some of the old political machines."
wcc.15.a: "Of course"
wcc.15.b: "Take it slow"

wcc.16.t: "Experts Recommend lower tariffs"
wcc.16.d: "Some of our policy makers, most notably Dean Acheson, has recently recommended that we lower tariffs with our allies at once. Taking advice from classical economists and the theory of comparative advantage, they state that tariffs are a net negative to our economy, noting that trade will create access to a larger consumer surplus. "
wcc.16.a: "Very well"
wcc.16.b: "Not Yet"

wcc.17.t: "A New Federal Reserve"
wcc.17.d: "The Federal Reserve is being recreated with a higher emphasis on expertise in economics, particularly economic training or leadership in banking. As such, an internal debate has broken out over which economists we should favor, those who place a higher emphasis on fighting unemployment or fighting inflation. Naturally, those who are chosen will gain a significant edge in government circles, and as such some think we should keep out of it, and simply appoint approved economists who are approved by our think tanks and/or other institutions, and let them do what they will."
wcc.17.a: "Fight Inflation"
wcc.17.b: "Fight Unemployment"
wcc.17.c: "Be hands-off"

wcc.18.t: "Push for Entente Membership"
wcc.18.d: "The Wise Men, especially Dean Acheson and Charles E. Bohlen, are pushing for us to join the Entente so we may provide it with proper support. They note that their analysts and studies show that this would give us a significant strategic advantage over foreign empires and syndicalism."
wcc.18.a: "Very Well"
wcc.18.b: "No, we must remain independent"

wcc.19.t: "Establishment of Policy Planning Staff"
wcc.19.d: "The Wise Man George F. Kennan has been appointed the head of the newly created Policy Planning Staff, established as a think tank to aid in the State Department in establishing strategic aims. In his newly prepared article, 'The Sources of Syndicalist Conflict', he recommends containing syndicalism through counter-propaganda and 'counterforce at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points', stating that while syndicalism can never be at peace with capitalism due to its current ideology, it is weak in the long-run and we can avoid outright warfare with them. As such his proposals would entail strengthening the Entente and investing in further pro-Western propaganda."
wcc.19.a: "Follow the Report"
wcc.19.b: "Only invest in counter-propaganda"

wcc.20.t: "Lobbyist Competition"
wcc.20.d: "Lobbyists have proved to be a useful means of connecting the new technocratic class with the desires of larger industry, with the lobbyists being themselves experts in this regard. Of course, while rent-seeking will have to be opposed, this communication is essential to a healthy economy and grants simpler access to required and vital resources, and already lobbyists in the growing military industries are competing for further attention with those who desire tax cuts for civilian industries. Should we favor one?"
wcc.20.a: "Favor Neither"
wcc.20.b: "Favor Military Lobbyists"
wcc.20.c: "Favor Civilian Lobbyists"

wcc.21.t: "Recruiting Harriman"
wcc.21.d: "With our retaking of New England, there has been much discussion of which members of the educated elite of New England into our government. Of them, William Averall Harriman is one of the most accepted, and placing him in charge of some local thinks tanks could help facilitate control over the region. Of course, we could make him a diplomat as well."
wcc.21.a: "Appoint Harriman as a leader"
wcc.21.b: "Make Harriman a diplomat"

wcc.22.t: "A New President?"
wcc.22.d: "With the US reconstituted we are being pressed to re-establish the United States Presidency, albeit with the office now heavily influenced by the new Fourth Wing of Government, a mix of highly-ranked bureaucrats, military leaders and foreign, economic and strategic policy analysts. As such, we should ensure the next president is appropriate to govern the population in these times, and capable of wise and capable governance. We could have Omar Bradley himself run, although that may be controversial given his position as an unelected leader of the WCC. After the nomination by a new Democratic Party, we will hold a snap election."
wcc.22.a: "Nominate Omar Bradley"
wcc.22.b: "Use politician Pat McCarran"
wcc.22.c: "Put forward Eisenhower"

wcc.23.t: "Return of Indirect Elections?"
wcc.23.d: "With much of the blame of the Civil War and even MacArthur's tyranny being placed on 'populism' and similar concepts that placed too much direct voting power in the hands of laymen who, believing in nonsense and trained in nothing related to government, readily vote for demagogues who oppose those who do know better, namely an actually educated 'elite'. This has lead to debates on recreating the original conditions of the US constitution in regards to the Senate, meaning they would be indirectly elected through state legislatures, helping those who are more fit to govern to properly represent their constituents."
wcc.23.a: "Of course"
wcc.23.b: "It's not needed"

wcc.24.t: "Pat McCarran Elected"
wcc.24.d: "Nevada Senator Pat McCarran has been elected President of the United States. A close ally of the WCC during the war, McCarran leans heavily on the Wise Men for advise on stopping syndicalism in the United States and abroad."
wcc.24.a: "A Victory"

wcc.25.t: "Eisenhower elected president"
wcc.25.d: "General Eisenhower has been elected president of the United States. As a man who served as a general in the WCC and a close associate of Bradley, he was considered less controversial to become president than Bradley himself. He is expected to rule from 'The Middle of the Road', as he puts it, and places a high emphasis on national security."
wcc.25.a: "A Victory"

wcc.26.t: "Bradley elected president"
wcc.26.d: "General Bradley has been elected president of the United States. As the former leader of the WCC he is credited with saving American democracy and as such was a shoe-in for the Presidency. Although he remains controversial for his wartime leadership in some circles most of the press appears reluctant to outright criticize him."
wcc.26.a: "A Victory"

wcc.27.t: "MacArthur Addresses Congress"
wcc.27.d: "General MacArthur has won the war and as such, announces a new nation to Congress, at least what is left of Congress that remained loyal to MacArthur. The Congress would serve to administrate civilian areas of the nation, while all other executive power would be wrapped in the military and devoted to combating socialist threats. While many suspect the speech and his recent 'conversion' in politics was due to a combination of his newly radicalized supporters and his lower powerbase outside of it, as well as the chaos of the nation, none dared disagree, as those few MacArthurists still in Congress applauded."
wcc.27.a: "Victory at last"

wcc.2706.t: "Alf Landon's Speech"
wcc.2706.d: "One of the groups we have had some trouble convincing to join our side are the Northeastern moderates who are often highly educated and wealthy. In an attempt to placate this group, we have sent out Alf Landon, a veteran politician, to speak in our favor. In a rousing speech echoing his earlier rhetoric, Landon noted that the new government "would not promise the moon", and that such promises are characteristic of extremist governments. Instead, he promises results, and a new free trade program that will help get America's economy back on its feet." He also noted that democracy will still exist, and that the military will just play a larger role, a role they earned by saving democracy. This speech will help us greatly in the Northeast, or so we hope, but it will take hundreds of men like Landon to give speeches before the American people are finally on our side."
wcc.2706.a: "Who's next?"

wcc.2707.t: "The Old Civilian Government"
wcc.2707.d: "Now that we have won the war, it is time to decide how we will fulfill our promises to the old government. Specifically, when MacArthur attempted to seize power for himself, Congress fled to us, and we promised to restore them to their rightful place in government. However, Eisenhower and Bradley are reluctant to give up their power entirely, fearing that the government will only get itself into another crisis in a decade or two. As a result, a compromise of sorts has been reached. The Wise Men will be the deciding force in government, having the power to gerrymander districts, put their thumb on the scale in primaries, and even decide the ultimate winners of elections. Further, they will have the ability to deny legislation if they see fit. Though the old politicians will not be happy with this change, they will have to accept it, lest the country succumb to anarchy again..."
wcc.2707.a: "A New Day in America!"

wcc.2708.t: "Wisemen Expansion: Henry Lewis Stimson"
wcc.2708.d: "The first man we are considering adding to the list of "Wise Men" is Henry Lewis Stimson. Stimson, having a reputation for wisdom in his role as secretary of state under President Herbert Hoover, is a natural first choice. His expertise in the realm of international relations is valuable, and appointing him would help us combat the claims that our government is a mere army junta. His energy is admirable, with many saying he works like a man twenty years his junior, and such energy is exactly what we need to rebuild America. However, there are some who blame men like Stimson for our current state of affairs, and instead call for a new generation of advisors, specifically military men."
wcc.2708.a: "Appoint Stimson"
wcc.2708.b: "A military advisor"

wcc.2709.t: "Wisemen Expansion: Rexford Tugwell"
wcc.2709.d: "Rexford Tugwell is the next man under consideration for addition to the Wise Men. Tugwell was an economics professor at Columbia University for over a decade, and we believe he has the expertise we are looking for from a civilian economist. Even more importantly though, he has a reasonable vision for rebuilding America, something that is far more lacking than expertise in these times. As was the case with Stimson however, his appointment could cause some controversy with military men who believe they should be making the decisions in government."
wcc.2709.a: "Appoint Tugwell"
wcc.2709.b: "The military is better in this role"

wcc.2710.t: "Wisemen Expansion: Gordan Gray"
wcc.2710.d: "Gordon Gray is the final man in consideration for addition to the Wise Men list. Gray, a lawyer, has been proposed as a leader of a new "Psychological Strategy Board". This board is meant to account for the fact that wars are not won by blood and guts alone; rather, gaining the support of the people is a necessary factor in modern warfare. The board will create propaganda and help shape the opinions of our citizens and those of our allies as well, and will concern issues such as the spread of Syndicalism around the world. Such a position could just as easily be given to a military man, but the choice of Gray would ironically have the same effect as his board might: winning over hearts and minds by showing the people we are on their side and work for them above all."
wcc.2710.a: "Appoint Gray"
wcc.2710.b: "We don't need him"

wcc.2711.t: "Deciding the Ohio Senate Election"
wcc.2711.d: "In the years leading up to the Civil War, 1936 in particular, the Socialist Party of America made significant gains in the state of Ohio. The traditionally Republican state turned away from the two major parties, but now, we hope to restore such a system to Ohio and the nation as a whole. This year, there has been a razor-thin result in the Ohio senate elections. The Republican mayor of Cleveland, Harold "The Boy Scout Mayor" Burton, faced off against Democratic house representative John McSweeney, who has more experience under his belt, having survived the Red Wave in 1936. It is up to us to decide which of these men will ultimately prevail."
wcc.2711.a: "Send Burton to Congress"
wcc.2711.b: "A new office for McSweeney" 

wcc.2712.t: "Deciding the Massachusetts Gubernatorial Election"
wcc.2712.d: "When New England asked for Canadian intervention in the Civil War, Massachusetts was one of the states that left the country. Now that they have returned, the state is holding elections to decide who will be the new governor of the state. The state's speaker of the house, Republican Leverett Saltonstall, is running against the state's Democratic attorney general, Paul Dever. Saltonstall, a moderate Republican with internationalist views, would be a good choice for our government overall, but Dever's 95% conviction rate as attorney general has garnered him attention as well. Who will be the victor in this race?"
wcc.2712.a: "Give Saltonstall control of the state"
wcc.2712.b: "Dever would be a fine choice"

wcc.2713.t: "Deciding the Idaho Gubernatorial Election"
wcc.2713.d: "This year's election for governor of Idaho has been particularly close. Idaho was a state we controlled during the Civil War, so we have much less to worry about from extremists in the state. However, the race between a former Idaho senator, Democrat Chase A. Clark, and C.A. Bottolfsen, chariman of the Idaho Republican Party, has come down to only a few thousand votes. We would be fools to allow the election to gain nationwide controversy, as it would make our wartime efforts look bad, so we should intervene and choose a winner before it is too late. The question is, who should we pick?"
wcc.2713.a: "C.A. Bottolfsen will suffice"
wcc.2713.b: "Chase A. Clark is the man for the job"

wcc.2714.t: "Union Laws"
wcc.2714.d: "During the Civil War, most unions chose to rebel against our government, with the lions share going to the Combined Syndicates of America. Unions are a thorn in the side of the business community, and now that there is good reason to punish these unions, they are insisting we do so. Most of our advisors believe that punishing the most extreme unions, those who joined the Combined Syndicates, would be enough to send a message to loyal unions and keep them in line for the future. However, a group of influential men led by Curtis LeMay are pushing for us to ban all unions, essentially killing the labor movement, but certainly causing a backlash in the process. What should we do?"
wcc.2714.a: "Punish syndicalist unions"
wcc.2714.b: "Ban all unions" 

wcc.2715.t: "Approaching the Wealthy"
wcc.2715.d.wisemen: "When the Civil War broke out, America's richest families were divided in their loyalties. Some fled to New England, largely avoiding the war. Others fled to the Pacific States, seeing them as the rightful continuation of American government. There was no shortage of wealthy families that stayed loyal to the federal government, seeing us as both a legitimate and a moderate option among the radical factions. Regardless, now that the country is reunited, there are calls for us to punish the wealthy in some way. Whether they were loyal or not, the argument goes, they all profited off the deaths of their fellow countrymen. As such, we must decide how we will deal with them. We could impose harsh taxation on unpatriotic wealthy families who sided with our enemies, and this would be popular with our people. We could also take a harsher approach and impose higher taxes on the entirety of the wealthy elite, whether they were loyal or not. This would give us more than enough funds for our reconstruction programs but it will also have negative impacts on our economy. What should we do?"

We could also take a harsher approach and impose higher taxes on the entirety of the wealthy elite, whether they were loyal or not. This would give us more than enough funds for our reconstruction programs but it will also have negative impacts on our economy. MacArthur has his own ideas for how to deal with the wealthy, however. He plans to seize 50% of the wealth of unpatriotc families, noting that he almost lost his life fighting for America, while these leeches only benefited from this conflict. He has confronted his detractors, demanding to know why they should continue to escape untouched, while so many of his men perished. If they resist, he argues, they will simply take all of their wealth, rather than only half. What should we do?"
wcc.2715.a: "Punish unpatriotic wealth"
wcc.2715.b: "Higher taxes on all the wealthy"
wcc.2715.c: "Seize half their wealth"

wcc.2716.t: "The Rockefellers Resist"
wcc.2716.d: "MacArthur's program of wealth seizure has gone smoothly so far, but the Rockefeller family has decided to resist us. They have refused to give up the fifty percent of wealth that MacArthur demanded, and have even tried to negotiate for a better deal, offering bribes to MacArthur and his fellow generals. The family originally fled the country to New England during the Civil War, and they have given validation to MacArthur's arguments through their resistance, a resistance that has infuriated the man. MacArthur's Watchmen have now tracked most of the family to their Kykuit estate, otherwise known as the John D. Rockefeller estate, in New York state. We have the building surrounded, and now we will bring them into custody and seize all of their wealth. The common man will thank us for this deed!"
wcc.2716.a: "We did warn them..."

wcc.28.t: "Alvin Owsley appointed Legion Chief"
wcc.28.d: "Alvin Owsley was one of the few in the WCC to fervently support MacArthur's return, and as such he has been appointed as the lifetime executive of the American Legion for veterans. As nearly all power now rests in the military this is a massively powerful position, one he promises to use to support maintaining veteran support of the new state."
wcc.28.a: "Wonderful"

wcc.29.t: "The Blue Terror"
wcc.29.d: "In what is being dubbed an American 'Blue Terror', the military is wiping out the Syndicalists and Old Klan who once held a strong grasp over the East. With swift military tribunals only being afforded to high ranking militia members, commanders are often entrusted to have investigators find militia members in hiding and swiftly arresting them. The effects of the so-called terror against extremist is clear as their capabilities collapse and the military directly occupies these territories, often deciding which to keep and which to allow Congress to administrate."
wcc.29.a: "Lean towards direct control"
wcc.29.b: "Lean towards autonomy"

wcc.30.t: "Fate of DuPont"
wcc.30.d: "With New England back under our control we must decide what to do with those who worked against our interests, especially in the upper-class now that the Red Unions have already been broken. The DuPonts are responsible for funding extremist groups in the region that desired breaking from the US altogether as a goal while the so-called 'Federalists' wanted to be ruled by Canada. With the region under our control, we might be better off destroying the regions 'Radical' movement by nationalizing DuPont's factories, although their anti-syndicalism may be useful if we wish to give them conditional amnesty."
wcc.30.a: "Nationalize them"
wcc.30.b: "Conditional amnesty"

wcc.31.t: "Kangaroo Courts"
wcc.31.d: "Once, it was the case that MacArthur intended to give his enemies truly fair trials after the Civil War. His patience has run thin as of late, though, and he believes it is too dangerous to give these rabble a chance at being free. Instead, he has ordered what he calls "fair trials for men like them", in which the outcomes are often predetermined and the sentence is death by firing squad, at best. It is said that the worst fate is being taken away by the Central Bureau, a fate which everyone understands to be final. Though nobody knows exactly what occurs to these unfortunate prisoners, many whisper that they are used as test subjects in nuclear experiments to further the not-so-secret government nuclear program. Alvin M. Owlsey and Curtis LeMay have pressured MacArthur and urged him to ensure that nobody escapes justice. As a result, thousands of men and women are being eliminated through arrests, trials, and executions. This process will take some time, as we must round up the leaders of the various traitorous factions and put them on trial, but eventually, it will be done. The work may be ugly, but MacArthur will do whatever he must to ensure a safe future for true Americans."
wcc.31.a: "Traitors don't die, they just fade away..."

wcc.32.t: "Cut the Middleman Out"
wcc.32.d: "With the highest leaders and/or offenders dead or otherwise missing, we must now decide the fate of middle administrators, leaders, and generals. These men had ideological commitments to their cause but lacked the power to cause destruction on a mass scale. Still, they are traitors all the same, and MacArthur has deemed them worthy of severe punishements. These will vary from immediate executions to use in government programs to life in prison, but we will ensure that none of these 'citizens' see the freedom they stole from our people ever again."
wcc.32.a: "They will pray for peace."

wcc.33.t: "Military Camps"
wcc.33.d: "The fractured nature of the Civil War means that we are sorely lacking for manpower even after the war has been won. This can be easily remedied, though, by using prisoners in military camps. These prisoners will cook, clean, or work hard labor, depending on the nature of their crimes during the war. These are often low-level leaders of the rebellious factions from the Civil War, who had little power but still played a role in killing their fellow countrymen and tearing the nation apart. They should consider themselves lucky to be alive, and many indeed express gratitude at the chance to redeem themselves. Those who complain however are never seen again."
wcc.33.a: "You are remembered for the rules you break."

wcc.34.t: "No More Traitors"
wcc.34.d: "Now that we have successfully eliminated those responsible for the Civil War and its many horrors, we can turn our attention to our people. Particularly, we should educate our children. These men and women who betrayed our great nation will serve as examples of disobedience, corruption, and evil. We must teach our children the importance of the nation if we are to avoid another such catastrophe in a generation's time. So, let us begin."
wcc.34.a: "Americans never quit."

wcc.35.t: "Civilian Allies: Allen Dulles"
wcc.35.d: "The Dulles brothers have particularly interested MacArthur for some time, sharing similar ideas on issues of the day, especially syndicalists. However, it is Allen Dulles in particular that interests MacArthur, for his tougher personality and ideas about foreign policy. Dulles would no doubt pressure the administration to take a more aggressive stance on the foreign stage, a pressure that MacArthur would be happy to have. Besides that, appointing the man would give us more legitimacy in the eyes of our people without endangering the interests of the military. Shall we appoint him?"
wcc.35.a: "Yes, bring him in!"
wcc.35.b: "No, keep the military advisors"

wcc.36.t: "Civilian Allies: Theodore Kaufman"
wcc.36.d: "Theodore N. Kaufman is a curious figure. He has supported posititons such as sterilization for Americans so that their children will not have to fight in civil wars and staying out of European conflicts at all costs. These positions were ostensibly taken to secure as much security as possible for America. More recently, he has supported a sterilization program for the worst traitors from the Civil War, preventing them from breeding and passing on their traitorous blood. If it is applied in a concentrated fashion over many years, he argues that we could even cease to see a birth rate entirely in such areas. MacArthur has shown some interest in these ideas, though of course such a policy would only ever be pursued against criminals. Shall we appoint this man and let him test his theories?"
wcc.36.a: "Yes, admit him to the cabinet!"
wcc.36.b: "No, we will retain our military advisors"

wcc.37.t: "Revolt in Indiana!"
wcc.37.d: "The city of Gary in Indiana is one that is rather close to Chicago, and is an industrial hub. Hence, it was heavily influenced by the syndicalist movement before the Civil War. Now that the war is over, though, they have apparently decided to continue resisting. Tensions have escalated in the city as it has slowly risen to be one of the most troublesome areas in the entire country. Only a few days ago, rioters crossed the line, killing three soldiers who were attempting to block a street from their advance. MacArthur, hearing this news, was furious, and vows to take action against the population there. However, nobody seems to agree on what should be done. Some argue that thousands of them should be sent off to military work camps. After all, we could always use more manpower at these camps. Others believe that we should arrest the worst criminals and put them aside for testing in the government's nuclear program. They could die a grizzly death, but at least they would be serving their country for once in their lives. Still others advocate a further wealth confiscation, punishing them economically and dooming some of them to starvation. Whatever we decide, it seems that Theodore Kaufman will be close behind our men, eager for an excuse to test his sterilization theories. What should we decide?"
wcc.37.a: "Send them off to camps"
wcc.37.b: "Give them a patriotic end"
wcc.37.c: "Hurt their wallets"

wcc.38.t: "Ban the Old Parties"
wcc.38.d: "With MacArthur holding onto power many allies such as LeMay, Kennan, Sutherland and the American Legion leadership is advising us to organize our supporters under a unified political party, rather than simply having known supporters of the military government. While it would take some getting used to, the Patriot Party would greatly aid in our efforts."
wcc.38.a: "Found the Party"

wcc.39.t: "Civilian Allies: Henry Morgenthau Jr."
wcc.39.d: "Henry Morgenthau Jr. has had an eventful few years. He was in the United States, then in the West, and now he is up for consideration in our government. Morgenthau's ideas about dealing with different regions of the United States are somewhat controversial, but MacArthur has shown a willingness to listen to what he has to say. One understanding his religious affiliation would understand his distaste for the now-defeated South, which he views as a region that has risen up traitorously on two occasions now. As such, he believes this region especially should be punished. To do this, he proposes a "Morgenthau Plan", in which the South will be de-industrialized, as he says it should be and always has been. While this idea may not be tenable on a wide scale, it has certainly given MacArthur some ideas for how to punish the Southerners, particularly the Fordists, and he believes Morgenthau has enough credentials to serve as a useful economic advisor. Shall we appoint him?"
wcc.39.a: "Yes, send him in!"
wcc.39.b: "No, his ideas are too extreme..."

wcc.40.t: "States of the Union"
wcc.40.d: "The most troublesome regions for our military have been the many towns and cities we control across the country. We simply do not have enough manpower to control them effectively, and would need more men if we were to do so. However, we could also hand them over to hand-picked civilian administrators, perhaps former politicians who were loyal to MacArthur during the war. Should we grow our ranks to be able to control these areas, or leave it up to local administrators?"
wcc.40.a: "Keep them under our direct control"
wcc.40.b: "Hand them over and watch them carefully..."

wcc.100.t: "A Banner for the Western Command"
wcc.100.d: "With the 30-Day Deadline’s end ever encroaching, it has become increasingly clear that America will once more descend into the horrors of fratricide for the second time in under a century. With this war becoming seemingly inevitable, serious thought has now gone into finalizing the flag that our forces and temporary government shall fly until this wretched war is won. As a detachment of the rightful Federal government, many suggest that the design we go with incorporate the proven American color of Blue, for it can not be mistaken for Syndicalist sympathy or cowardly surrender like the other two colors that adorn the glorious Stars and Stripes. However, many within our junta instead wish to further distance ourselves from the Federal government and the failed ideas of the old Union, and instead wish to adopt a black banner instead, symbolizing our strength and resolve in the face of conflict. Whichever design we go with shall become the formalized ‘national’ flag of the Western Command Center until the end of this brewing conflict, serving as the official rallying flag of our forces until we are graced with victory or crushed beneath the radical forces that assail our once prosperous republic."
wcc.100.a: "A banner of blue to show our dedication to the old freedoms of the Union."
wcc.100.b: "A banner of black to make ourselves more distinct from the Federal government."
wcc.100.c: "A banner of black and bordered with tan to further make our command distinct."

wcc.101.t: "Dressing for an Address"
wcc.101.d: "Against all expectations and odds, General Douglas MacArthur has lead his forces to victory in the civil war through blood, sweat, and steel. Once more taking his rightful place in the Oval Office, General MacArthur, by all accounts, is a changed man. No longer is he the servant of larger powers; neither the fools that languish in Congress, nor the Fat Cats of Wall Street. No, MacArthur serves only one man, and one vision. This man, of course, is himself, and his dream is the vision of a perfect and pure America, free from the taint of radicalism and lesser men. With the conclusion of the Civil War, that vision must be manifested. In order to facilitate its even swifter completion, the General has deemed it necessary to address the people of America, now once again united, and show them the future, explaining the part they must play if America is to remain loyal and pure. Most important of all though, MacArthur must play his part.\n\nWhat is one to wear to such an occasion? While yes, a good speech and fine orator skills can get you far, if you want to make a lasting impact, one's wardrobe is vital. Due to the sudden nature of this address, and due to the fact that he is only just returning to DC, MacArthur's wardrobe is... lacking, to say the least.\n\n Obviously, the General could simply remain in his now famous military fatigues, signaling to the people that militarily rule is here to stay. A slightly less orthodox idea for an outfit has come from MacArthur's newest chief of stuff who has suggested dying the General's fatigues blue, giving him the strong appearance of a military dictator, showing the American people who is truly in charge in this brave new world. Also within MacArthur's limited wardrobe is a suit, one he'd normally wear to the church services he hardly ever goes to. By wearing such a suit, he would give off more 'civi' vibes, perhaps enduring him slightly in the eyes of the citizenry. The last option open to the savior of America is also by far the strangest.\n\nIn a recent haul of tribute from traitors holdup in an old theater was a Roman toga and laurels, used in productions of Shakespeare's Caesar. Due to his long time status as the 'American Caesar,' the General seized these items, seemingly as a joke. However, with his address up and coming, he has expressed quite a lot of fascination with wearing the costume on top of his fatigues, to 'show the American people that the United States is gone, and in it's place has risen a new nation.' While obviously ridiculous, it would indeed get his point across, and none would be able to doubt that the United States of old was dead. Regardless, the General's address is only a few hours away, and a decision must be made."
wcc.101.a: "My fatigues will get my point across."
wcc.101.b: "Break out the dye, blue matches my eyes!"
wcc.101.c: "My Sunday Best is sure to do the trick."
wcc.101.e: "Veni, vidi, vici! America is reborn, and my outfit shall match that!"
