### Focuses ###
NYC_big_apple:0 "The Big Apple Breaks Free"
NYC_big_apple_desc:0 "Known by many names, such as the City that Never Sleeps or simply the City, the most curious and vibrant of all names for New York is the Big Apple. New York, or as it is more commonly known as New York City to differentiate it from the state it has now seceded from, now drifts towards its new destiny alone and untethered. Maneuvering between Syndicalist and Federalist forces, NYC has skinned by and now stands as an independent city-state on the brink of internal collapse. With gangs and looters rioting in the streets as Leftist cells fight local National Guard regiments, the crumbling coalition that is the Fusion Party of incumbent mayor Fiorello La Guardia now must attempt to steer this rickety ship towards safe harbor, lest the whole city sink beneath the waves of radicalism and chaos."
NYC_election:0 "The Sudden Election"
NYC_election_desc:0 "With his coalition that is the Fusion Party crumbling around him, Mayor La Guardia and his administration has called for sudden snap elections in order to reassure the people of NYC that he is devoted to the democratic process and willing to do what is best for the City at large. However, with his party falling apart, La Guardia and his Republican supporters now face staunch competition, and the easy win he so desperately expected is but a distant delusion. It is sure to be a close race as the future of America’s largest city, and the nearly 8 million souls within it, dangles in the balance."

NYC_reelect_laguardia:0 "Reelect La Guardia"
NYC_reelect_laguardia_desc:0 "Facing off against political opponents hungry to take his place while also seeking to maintain stability in his beloved Big Apple, Fiorello H. La Guardia and his Fusion ticket based around the Republican Party have eked out a victory in the recent snap elections. As such, Fiorello La Guardia - the Little Flower and Mayor 99 - has been re-elected as Mayor of New York City! Under his continued administration, NYC will strive towards becoming the fair, free, and equal Liberal Capitalist paradise it was always meant to be as La Guardia seeks to use his New Deal to transform the Big Apple into a shining city upon the hill."
NYC_new_york_new_deal:0 "New York, New Deal"
NYC_new_york_new_deal_desc:0 "Building off the work of his past allies while incorporating his own ideas, Mayor La Guardia has announced the creation of his new social program dubbed the New Deal. Centered around the ‘3 R’s’ of relief for the unemployed, the poor, and those whose lives have been destroyed by the war, recovery of the economy to pre-collapse levels, and reforms of the financial system along liberal and egalitarian lines in order to prevent such a disaster from happening again. This New Deal shall become the foundation of La Guardia’s agenda as the Mayor seeks to bring prosperity, liberty, and equality to New York City."
NYC_sweep_tammany_aside:0 "Sweep Tammany Aside"
NYC_sweep_tammany_aside_desc:0 "Tammany Hall has long been a thorn in the side of fair and free New Yorker democracy. Their proclivity for corruption and towards self-serving ambitions have hampered New York’s pursuit of a glorious destiny, and as such, this cancerous, corrupt, and undemocratic tumor must be excised once and for all. The Society of St. Tammany shall be banned from organizing, and their main members and bosses will be put to trial by La Guarida and his trusty ally District Attorney Thomas Dewey. Under their watch, the La Guardia administration shall poach the Tammany Tiger once and for all."
NYC_harsh_anti_corruption:0 "Harsh Anti-Corruption Measures"
NYC_harsh_anti_corruption_desc:0 "La Guardia built his reputation around a staunch stance against corruption, graft, racketeering, and other forms of parasitic selfishness that afflicted the Big Apple, and with his mandate once again secured, he has moved to make good on this promise. An anti-occupation wave will sweep this city, washing away sin and hedonistic excess in a purifying wave of law and order. Crime and corruption have no place in our New York, and La Guardia is the hero we need to champion this exterminatory effort."
NYC_clean_up_the_city:0 "Clean Up the City"
NYC_clean_up_the_city_desc:0 "With his anti-corruption measures already in order and showing the first blossoms of good results, Mayor La Guardia has moved to expand this ‘sanitation’ effort to all aspects of New Yorker society. A new idea of ‘cleaning up the City’ is to be spread as the La Guardia administration moves to cleanse and purify all aspects of NYC. Street cleaning and garbage pick up are being organized and made efficient. The sewage system is being expanded and modernized. NYPD anti-corruption measures are being expanded as new recruits are hired and trained en masse to better combat the organized crime problem. Anti-racist and pro-equal rights programs have been spread as La Guardia champions the African American cause. Internal affairs divisions are even being created across the government and its offices, providing accountability and an inside man into every branch of the metropolitan system, ensuring there is a system of checks and balances on every department in the City. With these initiatives and more, NYC shall be made the greatest city on Earth once again!"
NYC_democratic_unity:0 "Democratic Unity"
NYC_democratic_unity_desc:0 "Mayor La Guardia made NYC history as its first Italian mayor, running on his Fusion ticket - a big-tent unity coalition composed of his main base within the Republican Party as well as various elements from across the spectrum that came together in order to preserve New York democracy. Though this Fusion ticket has fractured and shrunk, La Guardia still enjoys the respect and support of many elements that were once part of his coalition as well as other like-minded representatives from across NYC’s political scene. With this in mind, it should be no issue for the La Guardia administration to drum up support and camaraderie between like-minded parties and groups within the stabilized political stage of the City. Together, we shall build a better and more free city for all to enjoy, while those who oppose us shall be relegated to a tiny and ineffectual minority."
NYC_public_works:0 "Public Works Programs"
NYC_public_works_desc:0 "In order to kickstart the local economy while also combating the vicious specter that is mass unemployment, Mayor La Guardia has passed an initiative that will provide numerous public works jobs for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers. This new public works program will have these previously jobless louts now provide their manpower and skills to numerous efforts regarding municipal expansion, from the creation of new housing blocks and subway tunnels to new roadways and even public art installations. No matter what the task, we will provide the men and the supplies, and in turn these men shall be paid for their services, hopefully breathing life back into our struggling economy."
NYC_reform_civil_service:0 "Reform the Civil Service and the NYPD"
NYC_reform_civil_service_desc:0 "Seeking to replace the patronage system that has long been rife with corruption and ineptitude as well as seeking to cleanse the corruption-rife police department, Mayor La Guardia has moved forward to fulfill his campaign promises of reforming the civil service and the NYPD. Shifting towards a merit-based civil service funded, trained, and overseen by the state while also moving to reorganize the NYPD to cut down on corruption, nepotism, racism, and police abuse, La Guardia hopes to eliminate crime and graft within the metropolitan bureaucracy in all departments while expanding jobs and further meeting the administrative and security needs of the state."
NYC_break_free_from_banks:0 "Break Free From the Banks"
NYC_break_free_from_banks_desc:0 "Yet another campaign promise of Mayor La Guardia was to restore financial health and to break free from the control of the corrupt banker class. For too long, capitalist barons and bank magnates have dominated the financial system of NYC, especially around Wall Street. In order to break this control, La Guardia’s administration has launched a full on attack of the NYC banking structure, strongarming these merchants of misery to lower interest rates, expand credit and loan availability, and other acts of better business in order to stop these oppressive capitalists from strangling the lowest classes of the City ever again."
NYC_work_releif_program:0 "Create the Work Projects Administration"
NYC_work_releif_program_desc:0 "Establishing the Works Projects Administration of New York, Mayor La Guardia has created a program aimed at employing the unemployed masses in order to build and repair the infrastructure and public amenities of the city. From roads and subways to parks and museums, all of NYC shall be modernized and made anew upon the backs of our own dedicated but down on their luck citizenry. With these jobs, they shall be tossed back into the economy as productive members while also modernizing our city in the process."
NYC_modernize_infrastructure:0 "Modernize and Expand Infrastructure"
NYC_modernize_infrastructure_desc:0 "Furthering the initial infrastructure work started by the WPA, Mayor La Guardia has authorized a specific initiative aimed at fully modernizing the infrastructure of the City. With new bridges, new highways, new parkways, new subway tunnels, new railyards, new dockyards, and more, NYC shall be made the best connected city on Earth!"
NYC_shining_beacon:0 "The Shining Beacon City"
NYC_shining_beacon_desc:0 "Under the guidance of Mayor La Guardia and his political allies, New York City has transformed into the prodigal shining city upon the hill. Our City is a liberal beacon for all the world to behold, and here on our miniature archipelago we stand as an inspiration for all to witness and hope to aspire to. Our factories hum to life without end, our people are fed, clothed, and with jobs. Our docks are filled with trade ships flying flags of every nation, and the culture of New York thrives like never before. Our City is a paradise on Earth, and under Mayor La Guardia, may we continue to shine for all eternity!"
NYC_talk_to_the_people:0 "La Guarida’s Fireside Chats"
NYC_talk_to_the_people_desc:0 "In order to reach each and every soul within his city, Mayor La Guardia has begun a weekly radio program in which he addresses his fellow New Yorkers, discussing recent events and news as well as the direction and future plans of his administration and the City at large. Broadcasting to every radio in the nation, as well as the odd television in the richer homes, Mayor La Guardia will be sitting fireside with his cigar and brandy each week, warming the hearts and easing the minds of all New Yorkers for years to come."
NYC_expand_parks:0 "Expand Central Park and the Gardens"
NYC_expand_parks_desc:0 "A personal pet project of the Mayor, a new initiative has begun to expand, renovate, and restore the various gardens and natural venues of the City. From Van Cortlandt and Central Park to the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, all venues will be funded and made anew with funding from the La Guardia administration, for these are our only local greeneries, and as such, they must be protected and preserved."

NYC_elect_welles:0 "Elect Welles"
NYC_elect_welles_desc:0 "Despite long odds and an uphill battle of a campaign, Orson Welles has beaten his once ally and friend La Guardia to become the newest Mayor of New York City. As the 100th Mayor in the City’s history, many suspect big things from this mild Socialist, but what he can deliver is not yet known. Famed for his career as an entertainer, many now hope his mastery of the dramatic world can now translate to skill in the political world. With a large and varied coalition of Liberals, Progressives, and moderate Socialist behind him, Mayor Welles is expected to bring pink egalitarianism to the Big Apple once and for all."
NYC_progressive_new_deal:0 "A Progressive New Deal"
NYC_progressive_new_deal_desc:0 "Taking notes from his once-ally and friend Fiorello La Guardia, Mayor Orson Welles has moved to hijack the former mayor’s socioeconomic plan, proclaiming his own form of the New Deal. Far more progressive and Leftist than the initial plan set by La Guardia and Roosevelt years ago, this ‘Newer Deal’ as it has been nicknamed is set to bring about a peaceful, moderate ‘reformation revolution’ within the Big Apple. Taking the ‘3 R’s’ of the New Deal - relief for the poor, recovery of the economy, and reform to ensure it never happens again - and taking them in a more radical and far-sweeping direction, this ‘Newer Deal’ will metamorphosize NYC into a true, pink welfare state that takes the good of both Liberalism and Socialism without falling to radicalism or extremist principles."
NYC_rock_the_cradle:0 "Rock the Cradle"
NYC_rock_the_cradle_desc:0 "For too long, Tammany Hall has been a cancer - eating away at the democratic fabric of New York City’s republican system. Mayor Welles has sworn to destroy the Society of St. Tammany and its vile and corrosive influence so that both the Democratic Party and the wider Democratic system can be free of their manipulations and machinations."
NYC_deal_with_police_power_abuse:0 "Deal With Police Power Abuse"
NYC_deal_with_police_power_abuse_desc:0 "For too long, the NYPD have waged a campaign of terror against the people of NYC. The police - long fallen to the siren’s song of corruption - take bribes, overlook crimes, or straight up take part in criminal acts while police abuse and brutality are at an all time high. We must take steps to reform the Police Department so that these paragons of virtue and protectors of peace, law, and order can truly live up to their sworn duty."
NYC_action_against_criminals:0 "Action Against Criminals"
NYC_action_against_criminals_desc:0 "With corrupt political machines and security organizations dealt with, now it is time to strike crime and chaos at its root. Mayor Welles has declared war on organized crime in New York City, utilizing everything in his power and beyond to crush the Commission of Lucky Luciano, Murder Inc., and any other smaller group and gang so that NYC may finally be safe, secure, and free from sin and crime once and for all."
NYC_leftism_without_syndicalism:0 "Leftism Without Syndicalism"
NYC_leftism_without_syndicalism_desc:0 "Mayor Orson Welles has danced along the thin line between progressivism or moderate Socialism, and full-blown Syndicalism. However, despite allegations and previous alliances, Mayor Welles is adamant that he is fully against the radicalism of Syndicalism and the revanchist extremism of the Third Internationale."
NYC_anti_racism:0 "Anti-Racist Ethos"
NYC_anti_racism_desc:0 "In order to mend the schisms that have divided our metropolis for decades, Mayor Welles has moved to mend the social and cultural divisions that have plagued us for far too long. No longer shall African Americans, foreign immigrants like those from Italy and Ireland or the Slavic lands and beyond, Asian Americans, and other foreign-born Americans be treated as second-class citizens. Instead, all shall be welcome and equal in our prosperous and egalitarian Big Apple. "
NYC_middle_ground:0 "The Middle Ground"
NYC_middle_ground_desc:0 "Standing as the middle ground between Steinbeck’s moderate but still dangerous Syndicalism and La Guardia’s noble but compromised Liberalism, Mayor Welles and his coalition of Laborists and Progressives are the bastion of true, free, and pure democracy, supported by ‘pink’ social capitalism and egalitarian, modernist, and progressive legislation. Through expanding the power of the electorate as we move towards a fair direct democracy, Mayor Welles and his allies will be the bastion that protects the City that Never Sleeps from the forces that would see our pure republic in a shallow grave."
NYC_power_to_the_people:0 "Power to the People"
NYC_power_to_the_people_desc:0 "As stated in the founding documents of the nation that birthed our city - or rather, the nation our city helped birth - the people are the source of power in a true and just American democratic system. With this in mind, Mayor Welles has moved to transfer all political power to the people of NYC, in essence creating a Leftist direct democracy that champions true democratic values. Though decried as Socialism by many of his rivals, Mayor Welles and his administration has assured all that this is truly the most democratic and liberty-minded move he could make. With this move, the citizens of our City will finally have the final and total say in all matters."
NYC_public_infrastructure:0 "Work-Relief Programs for Infrastructure"
NYC_public_infrastructure_desc:0 "In order to rapidly expand the infrastructure of the City while also reducing the plague that is mass unemployment, Mayor Welles has announced the creation of a new work-relief program. Hiring the unemployed masses in a series of public works projects aimed at building up the roadways, subways, ferry lines, and other modes of transportation and connection within the city, funded by the state through taxes, this new program shall modernize the arteries of the City while also breathing new life into our struggling economy."
NYC_public_broadcasts:0 "Free Public Broadcasting"
NYC_public_broadcasts_desc:0 "In order to provide entertainment and information to as many New Yorkers as possible, Mayor Welles has announced the creation of the Public Broadcasting System, or PBS. This network, funded and run by the state and volunteers though supplemented by viewers like you, provides informative programming for both adults and children on radio, in newspapers, and even in the emerging market of television so that all in the City may feel the full benefits of this electronically-fueled modern age."
NYC_democratic_city:0 "A Democratic New York City"
NYC_democratic_city_desc:0 "Crushing corrosive plagues like Tammany Hall and the Mob while shackling reckless forces such as the NYPD and his political enemies, Mayor Welles has ushered in a new golden age for New Yorker democracy. Like never before, fair and free democracy reigns true and vibrantly in our Big Apple, and finally the voices of each and every New Yorker is heard and taken into consideration. A socialized, ‘pink,’ and directly democratic New York has blossomed like a vibrant rose, and with Mayor Welles tending to this paradise, our prosperity can only continue."
NYC_arts_and_theater:0 "A City of High Theater and Fine Arts"
NYC_arts_and_theater_desc:0 "Drawing on his background as an entertainer, director, actor, screenwriter, radioman, producer, and more, Mayor Welles has moved ahead with his dream of transforming NYC into the jewel of the world entertainment industry. Seeking to eclipse the decadent, hedonistic, and capitalist-consumed hive that was Hollywood, Mayor Welles has okayed the creation of numerous bureaus, initiatives, and programs aimed at ushering in a modern New York Renaissance free from the cancers of capitalist predation and federalist meddling. With movies, art, music, cuisine, poetry, comedy, and more experiencing a new revolution in ideas and direction, this is only the beginning for the new New York."
NYC_criticize_the_powerful:0 "Mock the Powerful"
NYC_criticize_the_powerful_desc:0 "Mayor Welles has long made a habit of mocking the powerful of America, poking fun and exposing the hypocrisy of many a tycoon, plutocrat, or other public figure hiding a dark truth. Recently, he has reached nation-wide fame for his beef with William Randolph Hearst out in California as well as Douglas MacArthur in Washington, D.C. Calling out these titans of America and others of their stature, Mayor Welles seeks to expose corruption, authoritarianism, and hypocrisy in all corners of pan-American society."

NYC_elect_steinbeck:0 "Elect Steinbeck"
NYC_elect_steinbeck_desc:0 "Shocking the City with his surprise elections, John Ernst Steinbeck Jr. has been inaugurated as the 100th mayor of NYC. Renowned for his writing career as much as his Socialist advocacy and egalitarian crusade for the everyman, Mayor Steinbeck and his broad coalition of moderate Socialists, Syndicalists, Anarchists and other Leftists disillusioned with centrist politics seek to bring about a moderate and peaceful revolution as they try to dye the Big Apple a deeper shade of red."
NYC_grapes_of_wrath:0 "The Grapes of Wrath"
NYC_grapes_of_wrath_desc:0 "Repression works only to strengthen and knit the repressed is a screaming fact that sounds throughout all history. The reactionary forces that have served to oppress the proletariat of NYC have only strengthened our bonds and our resolve to enact real and lasting change. No longer shall reactionaries assault our pristine worker’s sanctuary, and from this great change and wrath we shall pluck the ripe grapes and other fruits of our labors."
NYC_crack_tammany:0 "Expose the Evils of Tammany Hall"
NYC_crack_tammany_desc:0 "For far too long, Tammany Hall and its agents of destruction have waged war on New York’s democratic institutions. These corrupt Democrats and bribed big-wigs have no place in a fair, free, and equal New York, and as such they must finally be dealt with. We shall peel back the facade and expose the Society of St. Tammany for what it really is - an infested and plague-ridden hive of scum and villainy that must be torn down so that NYC can finally be free."
NYC_deal_with_corrupt_cops:0 "Crackdown on Corrupt Cops"
NYC_deal_with_corrupt_cops_desc:0 "Corruption has turned the vibrant and noble blue blood of the NYPD into a black sludge that does nothing but further infect and bring ruin to our beloved city. The New York Police Department must be reformed from the ground up, with every facet of that accursed institution being rebuilt and set right so that these protectors of law and order and these defenders of the police can finally do their sworn duty to protect and serve above any pursuit of self-serving interests or ambitions. Police graft, brutality, abuse, and more shall be things of the past within the new NYPD of Mayor Steinbeck!"
NYC_cultural_expansion:0 "Metropolitan Cultural Revolution"
NYC_cultural_expansion_desc:0 "An artist at heart, Mayor Steinbeck has gone ahead with his plans to revolutionize the culture and traditions of New York City and its varied, vibrant people. Encouraging and incentivizing the creation of new artistic communes, Mayor Steinbeck has begun to promote and showcase art, music, literature, cuisine and more - all sourced from local creatives and creators. Together with these pioneers of culture and style, Mayor Steinbeck seeks to metamorphize what it means to be a modern New Yorker while ushering in a cultural golden age for the City that Never Sleeps."
NYC_moderate_socialism:0 "Moderated Socialism Fit for New York"
NYC_moderate_socialism_desc:0 "Our independence and our freedom was nearly robbed from us by the violent revolutionary radicals based in Chicago, and though our ideals align, we must not copy their model. New York is unique - a special city shining upon the burning hill that is the former United States, and as such, it requires a special form of Socialism tailored to fit its specific needs. Mayor Steinbeck has sworn to not allow the forces that besiege us the ability to influence our path ahead, for we shall rise above their bloody and costly model. Peaceful, reformist-orientated Moderate Socialism that is deeply tied to Syndicalist union economics and a fair democratic process is the only way forwards for our Big Apple."
NYC_working_mans_plight:0 "The Working Man's Plight"
NYC_working_mans_plight_desc:0 "Seen in his writings and in his activism and rhetoric, Mayor Steinbeck is a champion of the ‘everyman.’ In his works and in his legislation, the working man of our society - those with blackened, calloused hands and with coal or crop dust in their lungs - are the lifeblood of our free city. Making good on these ideas, Mayor Steinbeck has gone ahead to begin his relief and recovery program aimed at uplifting the working class of our Big Apple while providing greater protections and safety-nets to their ilk. Never again shall the laborers whose backs uphold the foundations of our economy and society be left in the mud to suffer and starve. Mayor Steinbeck shall extend a helping hand to all those in need, for the everyman of New York must always be taken care of."
NYC_unionize_dockworkers:0 "Support and Expand Unions"
NYC_unionize_dockworkers_desc:0 "If NYC is the shining, shimmering metropolitan pearl of the United States, then the unions of our city are the amalgamated sediments that make such a beauteous pearl possible. Mayor Steinbeck realizes this fact and as such has initiated his program to empower, expand, and promote unions and unionization across the City within any and all industries, making good on his promises to his Syndicalist allies along the way. From artistic communes to the industrial unions for our dockhands, factory workers, and what few agricultural outfits we have natively, all businesses and industries will be allowed to unionize and be encouraged - but not mandated - to do so, for unlike a truly Syndicalist system our democracy is not hinged around union membership."
NYC_communal_city:0 "A City of Cooperating Communes"
NYC_communal_city_desc:0 "Practicing a working synthesis of various Communist, Communalist, Distributist, Anarchist, and other cooperative ideals, New York City under the Steinbeck administration has been transformed into an interconnected and cooperating series of communes, cooperatives, unions, and guilds that each trade goods, services, and labor among themselves. In this system, each specialized unit or organization works like the cell in a body, producing its own produce or providing its own services to all within the City in exchange for other such things. Along with this, all has been socialized, providing public, mass ownership of all industries within the Big Apple, which in union with our new communal system has created the first modern, massive, working example of Communalist Communism in history, all without violent revolution or costly civil conflict."
NYC_internationale_protection:0 "Protection within the Internationale"
NYC_internationale_protection_desc:0 "Though Mayor Steinbeck’s closest political ally is with Sinclair out West, his old friend and fellow master of the pen is far from a reliable ally at this moment, and as such, NYC has but one option left to turn to. Across the Atlantic in Paris lies the only force we can come to rely upon. Mayor Steinbeck has made overtures to these European Syndicalists in hopes that they can guarantee our infantile independence. Hopefully, within the arms of the Third Internationale we can finally find peace and security."
NYC_build_internationale_headquarters:0 "Erect an Internationale Headquarters"
NYC_build_internationale_headquarters_desc:0 "In order to sweeten the deal with our new allies while also providing a useful service to these fellow Socialists, Mayor Steinbeck has announced the creation of a new compound that will serve as the homebase and control center of the Third Internationale. Here in our Big Apple, far away from the chaos and reactionary plagues that infect Europe, we shall safely host this Internationale Headquarters, setting it up to be the new homebase of a united league of Socialist nations, working together for peace, humanity, fraternity, and the wider Revolution."
NYC_red_apple:0 "The Big, Red Apple"
NYC_red_apple_desc:0 "Under the guidance of Mayor Steinbeck and his Leftist administration, the City that Never Sleeps has been blanketed in the warm, crimson embrace of moderated Socialism. Once a beacon of hedonistic capitalism and greed-fueled sin, New York City is now a shining red beacon of egalitarianism, cooperation, Socialism, and utopian paradise. Though our city still has much to do in order to fix the ills that have plagued us for decades, our glorious and glowing red Big Apple is more vibrant, more lush, and more bountiful than ever before, all thanks to Mayor Steinbeck."
NYC_CSA_nonagression:0 "An Understanding with the Syndicalists"
NYC_CSA_nonagression_desc:0 "Despite our shared ideology and ideas, our shared heritage and history, we have no desire to lose our independence now. However, Chicago detests this idea, and has made numerous attempts - both diplomatically and covertly - to absorb our free city. In order to reach a reality of peaceful coexistence, Mayor Steinbeck has utilized his ties and years-old friendship with Jack Reed in order to reach an understanding with the CSA. There is enough room for both our states on this vast continent, and together as equal but separate entities we can reach utopia!"
NYC_anti_reactionary_propaganda:0 "Anti-Reactionary Arts and Culture"
NYC_anti_reactionary_propaganda_desc:0 "Furthering the cultural revolution sweeping the City, Mayor Steinbeck has instigated a new wave of artistic and creative expression that shall consume the Big Apple. Pioneered through his latest literary works as well as with the works of closely allied artists and creators, this new wave is centered around a total rejection of archaic tradition, conservatism, and all things reactionary. New York must come to embody all that is modern, all that is progressive, and all that is ever-moving towards our Socialist future. These ideas shall become the new foundation of our reborn New Yorker culture, riding to prominence and popularity atop a tsunami of new artistic expression."

NYC_elect_trump:0 "Elect Trump"
NYC_elect_trump_desc:0 "Defying the odds and beating expectations, Frederick Christ Trump and his Reform Party has snatched victory from the jaws of certain defeat, becoming the 100th Mayor of New York City. Spitting in the face of his former allies in Tammany Hall, Trump’s Reform Party garners support and funding from the City’s large conservative minority and its elite, as well as from the Old Democrat Party from the Deep South. Though he has been fighting allegations of ties and sympathies to the KKK, Trump has floated above the worst controversies, and is now poised to bring about a free-market capitalist revolution to this stagnating, rotting Big Apple, seeking to rebuild NYC’s reputation as the greatest and most prosperous city on Earth."
NYC_make_NYC_great_again:0 "Make New York Great Again"
NYC_make_NYC_great_again_desc:0 "Chanted as ‘MNYGA’ by his adoring supporters, ‘Make New York Great Again’ has become the unofficial slogan of the Trump administration. Centered around the idea of returning to New York’s illustrious and booming past, Trump seeks to roll-back progressive policies and failed welfare legislation that have only served to drain the lifeblood from the city and its people while replacing them with financial stimuli plans, tax breaks, and other measures in order to breathe life into the faltering economy of the Big Apple. Additionally, Mayor Trump has pushed to stem the flow of immigrants and refugees from the Civil War, seeking to return to a time before NYC was plagued by these corrosive parasites. By rolling back the clock with new and modern policies, Trump shall make the City that Never Sleeps jump back into the electric limelight of its past so that we can have a brighter, more prosperous future."
NYC_break_free_of_tammany:0 "Revenge Against Tammany Hall"
NYC_break_free_of_tammany_desc:0 "Trump’s own Reform Party is itself a splinter from the Society of St. Tammany, composed of disillusioned Democrats and conservative capitalists who had grown tired of the domineering Irish Catholics and their self-serving ambitions. Now free from Tammany Hall and solidly in charge over them, Mayor Trump has moved to finally free the City and himself from their greedy clutches. The Society of St. Tammany shall be banned and dismantled, for our new New York has no room for corrupt and archaic political machines such as these."

NYC_support_our_cops_desc:0 "Convinced that the NYPD is infected by the machinations and meddling of the Catholic Church, Mayor Trump has begun a campaign to reform the New York Police Department from the ground up. Seeking to eradicate the monopoly on power Irish Catholics have held over the City for decades, all Catholic cops who refuse to renounce their religious identity while on the job shall be forcibly fired, to be replaced by proud and trustworthy officers from Godly and good Protestant families. Furthermore, all plans to desegregate the Force have been put on hold indefinitely as the new and sweeping reform measures are underway. Through legislation and a bit of strong-arming and deceit, the NYPD shall be cleansed and made pure so that our defense force can truly be trusted to provide unbiased protection to true New Yorkers."

Mayor Trump seeks to revive this legacy, utilizing new market reforms and industrial expansions in order to breathe new life into this old and storied city. Under his guidance, New York City shall reclaim its legacy as the foremost center of global finance and capital once more!"

NYC_bulwark_against_the_left_desc:0 "Despite his liberal economic policies and proclivity towards free market reforms, Mayor Trump is a stalwart champion of Protestant Conservatism. Rooted in his Christian upbringing, strict and independent childhood, and ties to groups like the ODP and KKK, Mayor Trump is keen on reforming NYC from a hedonistic and sinful heap of liberal excess into a paragon of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant virtue. Though secular, Christian morals still form the basis of Mayor Trump’s beliefs, and it is these beliefs that will create a safe, secure, and prosperous New York."

NYC_free_market_economy_desc:0 "In order to promote both domestic and foreign business, Mayor Trump has moved forward with his plan to transform NYC into an inviting hotspot for global trade. Creating a free economic zone encompassing the entirety of the city, Mayor Trump’s new NYC-FEZ shall create a tax-free market area for most industries, while certain key industries will have some small tariffs as a necessity to break even on running costs, in order to encourage economic activity. With this move, our Big Apple shall rise to become the greatest free port in the world, drawing business from around the globe to our docks and shores."
NYC_housing:0 "Trump's Housing Act"
NYC_housing_desc:0 "Seeking to eradicate the homelessness and unemployment epidemics while making a quick buck for himself and his economic partners, Mayor Trump has penned a new housing act aimed at creating affordable housing for the masses of the Big Apple. Though his administration and past business dealings have been plagued by accusations that Trump’s companies favor White citizens over Blacks and other minorities, Mayor Trump has assured his constituents that this is merely slander. Under this new act, the jobless and the willing homeless will be tasked with building new homes under the banner of both city offices and private companies working in unison. Once built, they can then come to rent or buy these apartments for themselves, while others shall be set-up as state-operated halfway houses, hopefully fixing two crises with one move and improving the public image of Trump along the way."

NYC_tax_cuts_desc:0 "Though the NYC-FEZ has been an initial success, Mayor Trump still believes he can do more to breathe life into the economy. Going beyond the tax-free haven allotted to big businesses and foreign companies, Mayor Trump has gone ahead with a slew of tax cuts aimed at the regular citizenry of the City. From the working class to the elites, all groups have experienced tax cuts in record-breaking amounts, which the Trump administration swears will be made up for in the increased revenue and profits such a move naturally breeds. With these moves, NYC will be the preferred tax haven of the wider world, inviting business and immigration from only the most favorable and profitable of clientele."
NYC_privatization:0 "Sweeping Privatization"
NYC_privatization_desc:0 "In order to undo the damage done by the foolish and short-sighted administrations before his, Mayor Trump has called for sweeping privatization measures to be taken across the city. All major economic sectors, from the subways and the sewers to the shipping lanes and consumer goods industry, shall be made private - broken into small entities and sold piecemeal to both corporations and the wider public. The era of a nationalized NYC is now dead - let privatization and prosperity reign free!"

NYC_private_infrastructure_desc:0 "Tapping the shoulders of his friends in high places while also opening the field to new private business that have flourished since his election, Mayor Trump has introduced his plan to massively expand and modernize the infrastructure of the Big Apple using private funds and firms to do the work. This shall function both as a grand test for his newly privatized NYC, as well as the first step towards his plan of totally modernizing and privatizing every aspect of the City that Never Sleeps. With this plan, new sewers, subways, parkways, highways, bus routes, ferry lines, telecommunications networks, and more shall be refitted, modernized, and expanded, all using private funds and private workforces."

All across America, violence and chaos reign supreme, and the same shall soon be true for the rest of the world as the global hegemons steer towards war. However, such a chaotic reality only breeds new opportunities for our metropolis, and as such, Mayor Trump has a plan. We shall tap into the hellish and bloody industry that is war so that we may profit while others squander and bicker like fools. Atop the ashes of the old world order, we shall build a prosperous and golden financial empire like the one which the world has never seen, for there is only one truth - War is a Racket!"

In order to fulfill our Christian duty while also earning some tax breaks and a ticket into Heaven along the way, Mayor Trump has encouraged and incentivized charitable acts like never before. All those within the state who make over a certain amount will be forced by law to give a small percentage to charity, in lieu of the taxes and other payments they’d have to make to the state in other, lesser systems. Our economy is already supported by their business, and now our poor and downtrodden shall be supported by their excess, all for the good of the City and our souls."

Yet, everytime we were close to catching an important figure or sticking it to a dangerous crime outfit, we would get shafted. Our intelligence would be wrong. The courts would fail us. The very bureaucracy that gave us our orders would fail to step in and defend us when things went wrong, letting criminals go and good men die all to save their own asses. ‘No longer!’ our officers say, for it is finally time to take control of our Big Apple ourselves, as we know we are the only ones who can save it from itself. Law and order shall reign once again, no matter the cost."

Brewing operations, extortion rackets, bootlegging, underground gambling, and even beginnings of things so vile as human trafficking and drug trading - all run by the Mafia in part or in full, pumping toxic sludge and thoughts throughout our fine streets without end - this has gone on long enough. This hedonistic degeneracy that has been allowed to infest our streets has persisted for too long, and now with our new and unshackled position of power, we shall wage open war against these louts, eradicating them once and for all."

Even those politicians who were not corrupt and who opposed that den of foxes ended up throwing our bonuses into such useless sectors as theatrics and public housing projects. It is about time we took our rightful dues from the very city we protect, for policing is hard, dangerous work, and we must be adequately compensated for such a heroic and herculean effort."

Not through conflict and violence, but through cooperation and coexistence have we achieved this peace. Opting to embrace corruption for the greater good of the City, the NYPD shall secretly tie itself to reasonable and diplomatic crime groups like the Commission, getting a cut of the action in exchange for turning a blind eye towards their less egregious operations. Our officers shall now demand a pretty penny in exchange for allowing those shadowy organizations in alleyways, seedy clubs, and other places to keep their operations running, all in the name of a peaceful - and profitable - co-existence."

Patrolling is immensely difficult in such a sprawling and vast metropolis, and so criminals flood the underpasses, alleys, and other dark underbellies of the city with ease. Let us make it apparent to all that those criminals we catch will be given harsh punishments for their crimes against the stability of the city and the safety of the Department. We shall leave no stone unturned and no dark corner unpatrolled, for crime cannot hide from our boys in blue - only law, order, and justice shall rule this city."

NYC_shoot_looters_desc:0 "The civil war had caused Brooklyn and the Bronx to collapse into riots and protests as Socialists waged war with our forces and other independent groups in the streets while Queens and the underground of the other burroughs further slipped into the grasp of the Mob. Although it has quieted down since then largely thanks to our efforts, the judge who called the shots before our rise had let all those looters and brigands off with but a mere slap on the wrist, leaving them open to commit the same crime the very next day. Those looters that have been caught by our Department deserve a quite simple and effective charge for their crimes. A bullet to the back of the head. A few executions will shape up this city’s ethos, hopefully rendering this punishment unnecessary as people come to their senses and learn their lessons."

Guns smuggled into the harbor have turned simple raids into sieges and petty thugs now pack arms meant for soldiers on the frontlines. Let us counter those thugs with an ever superior budget, for their own dens shall now be patrolled and raided by armored vehicles, heavy weapons, assault squads, and even the naval and air power of the Department’s finest."

No secret hideout or meeting place shall be safe from the ever-vigilant NYPD."

NYC_curfew_desc:0 "Good and well meaning citizens of this city should be in bed with full stomachs and prayers finished by 10pm at night without needing to be told to, so there is no further reasoning for why we do not need to institute a curfew throughout our city. Those that stay out past that time are already suspect and likely in the hold of a gang or crime syndicate, thus their just and warranted arrests shall be swift and just."
NYC_crush_syndies:0 "Crush Syndicalist Sympathizers in the Force"
NYC_crush_syndies_desc:0 "Our Department shall never forget those volatile beginning days of the civil war, when city hall was besieged by Socialists and our many businesses and parks were looted and ravaged, with shop owners forced onto their roofs with meager firearms in a noble but dangerous display of self-defense. Thus to prevent anarchy from spreading into the City once more, we must kick out those in the Department with Socialist leanings or sympathies, for they are the most likely to open our castle gates to those dark forces again."

There are many sly dissidents within the population that think they can get away with demonstrations and hunger strikes against our hold on the public order, and they are sorely wrong in that thought process. For dissidence is the first step towards disorder and anarchy. With these tips in mind, law and order shall reign in our fine City in perpetuity, and if you stray, well the NYPD is always right around the corner ready to change your attitude or more."

With most of our support coming from this population, as well as with most of our prominent members being Irish Catholics themselves, it is a no-brainer that we should tailor our legislation to cater to this important and influential group and their preferences for Catholic-orientated, conservative capitalist policies."

With this influx of WASPs, we should take their needs into account as we begin to consolidate our hold on the City. Despite religious differences and ethnic history between these WASPs and our Irish majority, the conservative desires of these two groups align quite well, and as such they should have no issues working together if they can be shown that it is for the common good of our shared interests."

With this in mind, we have moved to not restore the democratic system - even in a facade-form. Instead, we shall make it known that Tammany Hall, and we alone, rule this city now. The only votes held in the Big Apple will now only be between members of our own Society, and the secretive Bosses shall have the final say in all matters.

This art has been perfected by the Bosses of Tammany Hall over decades, and now rises to become not just an art, but legislated politics within our fine city. New York City shall be built upon corruption, graft, and other financial sin all authorized by Tammany Hall’s newest laws, with everything from our politics and economics to social culture revolving around criminal pursuits of prosperity. We do corruption like none other, and now we shall show the world just how well we have perfected our craft."

It was the elites that built this city, and it is the elites that run it now, and it is the duty of Tammany Hall to defend this reality. Conservative elitism shall be institutionalized, becoming the fabric and lifeblood of our new culture and society.

Now, with his efforts nearly paying off in full, it is finally time to call a summit between the five largest groups, or ‘families’ so as to keep the peace.

Side-stepping his allies in order to fulfill his own ambitions, Benjamin ‘Bugsy’ Siegel now leads Murder Inc. to pursue his own agenda and designs for the City. With the Jewish Mafia swearing loyalty to him as well, Siegel is poised to rule NYC like a mobster king."

NYC_gangster_multiculturalism_desc:0 "Murder Inc., like most criminal outfits within the Commission, is primarily composed of Italian and Jewish immigrants originally seeking protection and opportunity for profit in numbers. We should recognize and reciprocate the legacy, drawing on our multicultural background to bolster our new identity. Jewish and Italian culture, as well as the Jewish and Christian faiths, will become dominant within the Big Apple, forming the basis of what it means to be a New York itself. Synagogues and cathedrals, delis and wineries, and of course suit shops - all this and more shall adorn every city block as Italian and Jewish culture come to dominate the Big Apple."

We shall put this reputation and experience to good use, solving problems the only way we truly know how. Every dissident, detractor, rival, and other force of opposition shall be killed in cold blood, each an example for the next. Broadway will run red with blood as the City is cleansed of all who are foolish enough to oppose Murder Inc."

NYC_gangster_state_desc:0 "Eschewing any ideas of modesty and restraint put forth by Luciano or Lansky, Bugsy Siegel knows that the only way for the Mob to rule this city is as it has always done. Crime, fear, violence, and secrecy shall reign supreme as Muder Inc. constructs a true gangster state centered around the new ‘mobster king’ Bugsy Siegel. The only law shall be the decree of Siegel, and the only justice shall be what Bugys deems fit for each case. The final word in all matters shall be Siegel’s voice, and Murder Inc. as a whole shall run the City that Never Sleeps without pause and without end as the undisputed crime lords of New York City."

NYC_empower_unions_desc:0 "The City is filled with unions, representing numerous different industries and groups while bargaining for better rights and protections for the working class. Seeing a useful political ally and economic asset in these unions, our administration has issued a proclamation in support of unionization throughout the City and its industries.

Seeing this reality for what it is, our administration has gone forward with its plan to eradicate unions within New York City. Unions shall be struck with far harsher restrictions, forcing many of the greatest offenders to close down and cease operations while the surviving unions will largely be too weak to get anything of substance done.

NYC_emergency_draft:0 "A Necessary Draft"
NYC_emergency_draft_desc:0 "Though many within our population will find the move to be disagreeable to say the least, we must instate a mandatory draft so that we can gather the manpower needed to defend our city.

NYC_industrialization_funded_by_elite_desc:0 "In order to build up our domestic military industry as quickly as possible, our administration will turn to the elites of NYC for funding. Though we may not agree with the methods of these titans and tycoons, none can deny their influence and wealth, and with that in mind, they would make the perfect economic patrons.

Though these criminals are ruthless, bloodthirsty, and dangerously ambitious, they also show the potential to be a useful tool of the state. We could decide to turn a blind eye to some of their less extreme crimes if they agree to help us on matters of national security and the like, or we could simply put down these criminals like the dogs they are."

We shall invite these officers and soldiers in training to our borders - a neutral safe zone free from the ravages of the war where they can finish their training while serving their hometown, and once they are done being trained, we will have a loyal and experienced new class of officers to press into service."

Taking this legacy in stride, we shall keep this tradition alive with our new navy as we create more new ships and hire more sailors than ever before.

All along the New York Harbor and along all major coastal regions within the City, new sea walls, pill boxes, and other coastal fortifications will be erected, creating a near-impenetrable line of defense that would take the largest amphibious landing in history in order to crack.

newyork_prewar.1.d:0 "As our mighty and righteous Worker’s Government prepares for the Second Revolutionary War that shall surely follow the end of MacArthur’s foolish deadline, it seems that just as many within our own ranks cannot wait for the coming conflict, this same hunger for war as spread to MacArthur’s Federalist lackies. All throughout New York City and the Jersey coastline, Federalist forces have launched a preemptive attack against our forces in hopes of reclaiming the Big Apple. Made up mostly of loyalist sailors stationed within the city itself, the overall goal of the attack is seemingly to rob us of arguably the second most important city next to Chicago in the Revolutionary struggle. While our forces are and indeed have been entrenched in New York since well before the 1936 election, the Federalists are not without aid in their attempts to rob us of New York, as many locals are aiding them against the ‘Socialist menace.’ Despite this aid, the battle is still raging, and victory could fall to either side"

newyork_prewar.2.d:0 "Massacre. Bloodbath. These words seem insufficient to describe the events that took place in the aftermath of the Battle of New York City stalling. Just how many men died on either side is still unknown. French journalist Gabriel Péri who had just arrived from the Commune along with a myriad of others, described vivid scenes from the battle, including how on entire streets, whole squads would be mowed down in a matter of seconds by either side. Mass deserations on both sides have been reported, and it seems that In the wake of this disaster, Federalist units have begun quitely abandoning the City, leaving for more friendly shores. However, our own units have also begun pulling back out of their own accord, officially due to us winning the battle. but according to some reports this is simply not the case.\n\nIf they are to be believed, the New York Police Department, local National Guard units,and allegedly even Mobsters have begun to clear out stragglers from both sides in the recently concluded battle. The reports go on to say that they are allegedly preparing to declare the City either a neutral zone or fully independence from the United States. Attempts to reach out to Fiorello La Guardia, Mayor of New York, have so far been met with not but vague assurances that the Mayor’s Office ‘has the situation under control.’ With this being the case, and with worries that the Federalists could still be waiting to take our largest sea port from us, members of the High Command, especially those with close links to the Centralist and Vanguardist factions, have called for us to do anything we can to ensure that New York City remains within our hands, even if that means forcefully marching down broadway to restore order. However others within the High Command suggest for us to simply let the city be. After All, our own men reported that we won the conflict. What point is there in not believing their word? Besides, war with the rest of the country is coming, and resources that are spent to defend New York are resources that aren’t being spent to spread the Revolution to our compatriots. Regardless of what we do next, we must act quick, lest the City fall into Federalist hands after so hard fought a battle."

Coming as something of surprise to the rest of the divided nation, La Guardia cited the recent violence of the Battle of New York along with a myriad of other reasons for the City’s exit from the Union. La Guardia, as his first act as Mayor one of the last remaining city-states on Earth, has called for snap elections, to be held at an unspecified time in the near future.\n\nWhile La Guardia’s decision may seem rushed and without popular sentiment, this is far from the case. For years, New York City has felt disconnected from the rest of America. Be it New York’s highly unique culture, differences in politics, economic prowess or the government repeatedly failing to deliver on promises of aid during the Depression, plenty exists to justify the Big Apple’s newfound freedom. The cherry on top, and by far the largest contributor to independence’s popular mandate, has been the Battle of New York. Nothing better exists to show that New York is valued not as a city but as a strategic resource then that bloodbath that was the Battle.\n\nRegardless, New York and it’s vast economic, industrial, and population resources are now lost to the Revolutionary cause, and due to the looming threat of the civil war, we have no choice but to let them be, for now."

Citing among other things the bloody Battle of New York, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia has called for snap elections as the Big Apple enters the waters of statehood. Despite just declaring independence, notices of recognition have already been passed, most notably from the exiled government of Monaco, which has welcomed New York to the world stage with open arms"

NYC.0.t:0 "The ‘City that Never Sleeps’ Now Burns"
NYC.0.d:0 "Sitting at the end of the mighty Hudson like a wondrous pearl washed towards the sea, New York was once the largest city in the now-dying Union, and perhaps even the greatest metropolis on Earth. First settled by the Dutch in 1624, the once sleepy and unassuming coastal colony that was New Amsterdam would evolve overtime to turn into the bustling, ever-awake center of global economics and culture that it is today, doing the impossible to become the urban crown jewel of the old United States. However, the golden era that brought NYC to this breathtaking pinnacle has been abruptly cut short, and now the infamous Big Apple burns much like the rest of the dying Union. \n\nThe outbreak of the Second American Civil War spelled doom for the American nation and its people, with families and friends torn apart as political tensions sparked factionalism and violence. These divisions were seen across the faltering nation, from the Pacific Coast to the Deep South to even the outlying Unincorporated Territories and beyond. However, due to the close-quarters nature and sheer density of the Northeastern Metropolis, these tensions and acts of violence and political expression were far more cutthroat and intense here in the Big Apple than perhaps anywhere else in the nation. Being the most densely populated region in the nation while simultaneously standing as a melting pot of diverse cultures and viewpoints, New York City became a bloody microcosm of the wider Civil War. Given its location and key importance, the Syndicalist and Federalist factions both claimed the City as their own, with this being evident in the streets as separate borders and barricades rose in this new urban hell. Neighbor fought neighbor and brother slaughtered brother as the cosmopolitan nature of the metropolis turned against it. Socialist unions and militias from the City’s vast industrial sectors took up arms against the New York Police department as the various crime syndicates feasted on the chaos. The Brooklyn Shipyards and local naval bases devolved into infighting as Federalist and Syndicalist-aligned sailors turned on each other in order to secure the vast fleets dry-docked for repairs and refits. Wall Street devolved into bloodshed as Socialist made a run on the financial sector only to be met by the guns of the NYPD and Tammany Hall forces who had taken to the rooftops to defend their assets. Makeshift fortresses and blockades littered the streets and alleys, with Broadway turning into a No Man’s Land littered with shell craters and bodies only disturbed by the shudder of canons or the screams of scavengers and looters caught in the machine gun fire of a passing patrol or encamped hardpoint. The city that never slept was kept constantly awake by the blood-curdling horrors and cacophony of endless war, but somehow, the City held firm. \n\nWhat was once a glistening example of the American Dream is now a blood-soaked ruin, and at the center of it all is Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who has rallied the bulk of the City’s non-radicals under a temporary banner for peace and for the preservation of NYC. Elected in 1933, La Guardia was the first Italian mayor of the city and the first mayor in decades to be free from the corrupt Democrat political machine known as Tammany Hall. With the City now independent - having fended off the selfish desires of both Chicago and Washington, Mayor La Guardia has become the main executive of the city, and to many, its final protector. Standing in the middle of fighting Socialists, police officers, mobsters, Democrats, opportunists, Federalists, and more, few envy La Guardia’s position, but despite an upcoming emergency election, his determination to save his city has not wavered. Navigating the minefields, both political and literal, of his war-torn city, it is up to La Guardia to attempt to bring peace to this hellzone. However, with numerous forces circling ‘Little Flower’ as he is sometimes called, La Guardia must act fast lest he lose his position to more power-hungry forces."

NYC.1.t:0 "Snap Elections for the Mayor of NYC"
NYC.1.d:0 "With the Big Apple now free from warring Syndicalists and Federalists that nearly destroyed our metropolis, we too have become free of the only unifying force keeping Mayor La Guardia’s engorged Fusion Party ticket together. With the writing on the wall and with the City in desperate need of a resolved, or perhaps even new, direction, the La Guardia administration called for new snap elections - a first for the City. In the chaos that has surrounded the hasty organization of this new election, four men have risen to become prime contenders for the new title of Mayor of New York City. \n\nDefending his mandate and his administration stands Fiorello La Guardia, the incumbent Republican mayor touted by many as ‘the Man who saved New York.’ Despite setbacks and the near-complete collapse of his Fusion Party coalition, La Guardia is still in a strong position to win re-election, though it is far from as assured as it was just a few short months ago. Despite the chaos, he still seeks to institute the New Deal - a progressive socioeconomic plan partially developed years prior during his time working with the late Franklin Roosevelt - to boost and equalize the economy while safeguarding true American democracy within the City. His prime opponent vying for the same support base is Orson Welles and his Labor Party, largely seen as the ‘Good Syndicalist’ despite desperate attempts to distance himself from Syndicalism and Revolutionary Leftist ideas. Welles is running on a campaign of egalitarian social justice, progressive social democracy, and patronage of the vibrant New York cultural scene in a fair social capitalist system. Further to the Left of Welles, John Steinbeck has also thrown his hat in the ring. Having united the remaining Syndicalist and Socialiest cells within the City limits as well as those Leftists disillusioned by Welles’s moderate and compromised approach, Steinbeck seeks to bring about a peaceful Socialist reformation while dodging claims that he is a spy or agent of the CSA or the Third Internationale. These accusations however have not stopped his message of equality and economic redistribution from resonating with the city's extensive urban poor, giving him a strong chance to swipe the election from behind. Finally there is Fred Trump, a real estate magnate who has become the figurehead for big business and free-market capitalist interests within the Big Apple with his Reform Party - a splinter from Tammany Hall with ties to the Old Democratic Party down south. He wants to turn the City that Never Sleeps into a modern Venice where government and business go hand in hand to encourage the prosperity of the state. However his track record with dodging taxes and equality laws while funding and supporting the ODP and the KKK have made many wary of his promises, but they can do little to stop his powerful backers and the torrent of support he has from former Tammany supporters. \n\nWith these candidates all poised to lead the City at this turbulent and crucial crossroads, it is truly anyone’s race as the election draws near."

NYC.2.d:0 "As our newly independent New York settles into the reality of being a free city-state, along with all the benefits and dangers such a existence provides, our first major post-independence obstacle has reared its ugly head. Although the new administration has settled into its seats and even with Mayor [root.getleader] already beginning measures to restabilize the City, chaos still reigns in the Big Apple. From Flatbush to Astoria, from Bed-Stuy to Riverdale, all of NYC is abuzz and aflame as looters, rioters, and other degenerate opportunists ransack our beloved city in what is being quickly known as ‘The Great Crime Wave of [GetYear].’ The city streets twinkle with the broken glass of storefront windows and run red with the blood of innocent and guilty alike as crime threatens to completely consume the City that Never Sleeps. Seeking to capitalize on the anarchy, the Commission headed by Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky along with Murder Inc. and the Five Families have taken this moment of weakness to make their move to corner more of the city. The NYPD has done its best to fight back against this menace but, out of fear of escalating the situation, the Mayor has held them back. Many wonder how long this can go on as the City dances on the balcony above anarchy and hedonism."

Mafiosos raid apartment blocks and police stations alike while squads of the Boys in Blue have been pushed out entirely of whole neighborhoods like Little Italy, with nearly all of the Bronx and Brooklyn already in Mafia control with the rest of the boroughs likely to follow. The situation has grown dire and Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine has met with the Mayor personally to argue his case. Chief Valentine has demanded that the restrictions on the police be relaxed or abolished entirely, and that the police force be augmented by the NYC City Guards and the armories be opened immediately, so that the NYPD can properly defend the City from the radicals and criminals that besiege it. The Mayor is still hesitant to comply however, citing that such a move would only cause further panic, so it would seem that the political administration is now useless in this matter. However, history will happen without the permission of these fat-cat plutocrats or with it, and something must be done now - the only question is what. With the fate of the city in play, does Chief Valentine listen to his orders and let NYC be consumed in crime, or does the NYPD break free of convention to save the city?"

All across the city, mob rule reigns supreme, with the Police Headquarters at Centre and Broome Streets being one of the last blocks still solidly in Police hands. The final nail in the old regime’s coffin was struck when mafioso forces marched onto City Hall and literally threw the Mayor out of office after slaughtering many of the lower officials inside, with one mayoral aid notably dying by gunshot through the eye-glasses while getting a massage. With the Police having washed their hands of the situation and the resident National Guard too busy keeping the Civil War on the other side of the border, the Commission now rules the Big Apple."

NYC.301.t:0 "The Police Stop the Madness"
NYC.301.d:0 "The NYPD has done what many thought impossible - they have saved NYC from itself. After getting the go ahead by the Mayor to act without restrictions, the police immediately began an all out assault on the Mob citywide. National Guard units aided by the Boys in Blue have made assaults on all known major Mob hideouts, flushing the rats out all at once. Mobsters and crime bosses have been gunned down and executed by the dozen and the Five Families have fractured under the pressure. Mob affiliates have begun to flee the city en masses, while others have thrown in with the NYPD seeking amnesty or even rewards, leaving only the most die hard mobsters remaining in the city. However they know their power is broken and will take decades to recover, if at all, for the age of terror these criminal have wrought is over. In celebration of his victory, Police Chief Valentine has held a victory parade through the streets of New York, with Broadway lit up in excitement for the first time in months. \n\nAll was not normal however, for the City now stood as a fundamentally changed setting. After the dust settled and as the trash from the parade was cleared from the street, Chief Valentine, in a shocking move that few had the chance or will to resist, announced the now-former Mayor had been arrested during the celebrations, stunning the city. Chief Valentine accused him of letting the city fall into anarchy, and as such has denounced him as being unfit for duty. In his stead, Lewis J. Valentine has named himself as ‘interim’ Mayor without any word of when his term would end, if ever."

NYC.4.t:0 "Every Crime Syndicate Needs its Boss"
NYC.4.d:0 "With literal Mob rule now secured over the City, the Commission has found itself in unfamiliar waters. It had operated for years in the shadows, trying its best to stay out of the limelight and its members out of jail or the grave. Now, however, it has placed itself as front and center as it possibly could, for the City that Never Sleeps now dances in the moonlight with criminals and crooks. With the faceless Commission dominating metropolitan affairs, the public has begged for a return to some form of normalcy, and keen on keeping power, the mobsters have hatched a plan. \n\nBefore the chaos that befalls us now consumed the city, just a few short years ago, the Five Families were divided as gang war ate away at the foundations of societal order. This came to a head in the Castellammarese War as the largest crime boss in the City at the time Don Salvator Maranzano tried to force the Five Families to name him the ‘Boss of Bosses’ - or ‘Capo di Tutti i Capi’, which ended with the murder of Maranzano and the rise of Luciano’s Commission. Since this crime war, no single soul has called the shots in the Big Apple’s criminal underground, but the people of the City expect a central figure to rally around. To alleviate this need and to move towards stability and some shred of true statehood, the Commission has decided to take this haughty term ‘Boss of Bosses’ in stride, and have announced that they will internally choose a new Capo di Tutti i Capi to be the public face of the City’s new shadow regime - a Mayor by any other name. With this decision now declared, the City and the Commission now prepare to raise one of their own up to be Mayor of NYC - a prospect no mobster ever thought possible before these troubling times."
NYC.4.a:0 "Gather the Godfathers!"

NYC.5.t:0 "The Commission Convenes to Choose a ‘Capo di Tutti i Capi’"
NYC.5.d:0 "Today, the leading members of the Commission - chiefly represented by Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky - as well as Murder Inc. and the heads of the Five Families all gathered in a discrete location - more out of habit than necessity - to decide which one of them would become the public face of the Mob’s rule over the City. Though this group had learned their lesson on pooling resources and power into one single Don when Maranzano had to be put down just a few years ago, the Commission had decided that a face must rise to serve as the public image of our shadowy brotherhood. Mockingly taking Maranzano’s preferred term of ‘Capo di Tutti i Capi’ or the Boss of All Bosses, the group seeks to grant this newly-reformed moniker to one among them that will be the facade that stands between the people of New York City and the operations of our criminal syndicate - a criminal Mayor in sheep’s clothing. \n\nNaturally, the leading figures and founders of the Commission were the candidates that had been nominated by their peers to ‘lead’ them. The first was Charles ‘Lucky’ Luciano - a transplant from the Chicago Outfit with deep ties to Capone; ties that were sundered when Capone desired all of Chicago for himself forcing Luciano to relocate to the Big Apple nearly a decade ago. Luciano is the ringmaster of the Commission and its dominant co-founder while also being one of if not the most powerful mobsters in New York City’s underworld. He is also widely known and widely feared, being popular among the poor masses and immigrants of this metropolis for his generosity to the poor and minor adherence to pseudo-Socialist, ‘Caponeist’ ideas. Second to Luciano is his right hand man and fellow co-founder of the Commission Meyer Lansky, who has grown fantastically rich off of his gambling empire. Also a co-founder of Murder Inc., Lanksy - known warmly as the Mob’s Accountant - is seen as the compromise candidate between the dreams of Lucky Luciano and the ambition of Bugsy Siegel, and Lansky supports the idea of ‘going legit’ in order to bring in more profit and less heat. Finally, Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel stands as the head honcho of the hitsquad-for-hire Murder Inc. with a legion of Italian and Jewish gangsters and thugs behind him. Siegel opposes this idea of a National Crime Syndicate that Lansky and Luciano espouse, and instead seeks to restore the position of the Mob to its roots. Siegel champions the creation of a true ‘Boss of Bosses’ to lead the gangs of New York into a new golden age of criminal enterprise unfettered by law and drenched in blood. With the cards on the table and with everyone all-in, it's time for the Capo di Tutti i Capi - and in turn, the new ‘mayor’ of New York, to be chosen once and for all."

Tammany Hall, otherwise known as the Society of St Tammany, is infamous in New York for its corruptive and meddling ways, already having been disgraced during La Guardia’s first electoral win. Tammany Hall is a political machine, controlling Democratic votes and wielding tremendous amounts of influence in the City and beyond - particularly among Irish and Anglo citizens. Under the infamous ‘Boss Tweed,’ its corruption became public and since then it has only gotten more and more revile, with rumors of their mob ties and other unscrupulous activities abound. Now, with our nation independent and secure, we must weed out this fountain of corruption. The NYPD is primed and ready to raid its offices and bring its leaders in.

However, with the situation in our nation finally stable, we have decided to take a firm policy towards ‘the Street’. Socialists within the city detest the notion of Wall Street and wish to see it burned. They decry it as the center jewel in the crown of capitalism and if we were to destroy it we could make a newer, more humane economy on its ashes. However, the rest of the City predictably has the opposite view. They point to the prosperity of the early 1900s and the titans of industry it created as proof that the Street must be saved. They argue that if we go about destroying the very foundations of American capitalism like the Stock Market then we could do irreparable harm to the economy. We must make a decision."

However, the suffering wrought at our hands if we were to condemn one of the most populous cities in the world to starvation would be unbearable to many within our cabinet and certainly would be a back look in the eyes of the masses.

This could be very beneficial to us as using them could do much to secure our rule. However, there are some things an upstanding government like ours can't be caught doing, like liquidating dangerous seditious elements within our borders through illegally hired hitmen for example, and this is definitely one of them so it would have to be discreet. Furthermore, many others within our government have argued that if we do this, then we are no better than the despots of old and new or the very mobsters and murderers we would be dealing with.

Like Olvany as well, the charges against him have been cleared justly, and Walker walks as a free and lawful man once again thanks to Tammany Hall’s patronage. The people already know Walker, with his reputation as a sound Liberal champion being well-known, and while he did have some hiccups in the past it won't be hard to pave over them to restore his reputation. Additionally, as a former public figure his election would be a lot more palpable to the people. Regardless of who is chosen, Tammany Hall and its Bosses shall truly be in control."

The United States of America, in all its beauty and splendor, now stands - beaten, but alive - once more. Let us now go about repairing our beloved Union, undoing the horrid mistakes of the past to build a brighter future."

The man had snuck up on the girl, a cigar in his mouth and rolled down his torso, he pulled a cloth from his pocket and pushed it up against her face, she fell and he started to run away, her like a sack of flour over his shoulder. I readied my hand and the bullet pierced his leg, causing him to fall over, the girl landing on his back. I shot him in the head and had her awakened by a quick stimulant. Apparently he was her former landlord after she bought her own flat.’ The man returned home, kissed his wife and enjoyed a glass of brandy from the Great lakes Legion and smoked a cuban cigar, just a normal day in the grand country of Long Island!"

Battle,tThe first Black officer, and champion of the desegregationist movement, has seen fit to remind the government about the desperate need for more police one streets, and the ever increasing tension between the public and their protectors. He argues for an expansion of Black patrolmen into the police as well as the recruitment of esteemed members of the Black community, to help ease tensions. These efforts don’t come unopposed however, as prominent businessman and politician Fred Trump has virulently opposed the idea, circulating leaflets which warn that desegregating the police will lead to a Black revolution in New York, sparking even further violence. Behind closed doors however, it is suspected Fred Trump truly opposes the efforts as it would hurt his close ties to several Prominent figures within the ‘Constitutional American Republic’, and fears giving any form of leeway to African groups will irreparably damage relations should things come to that."

NYC_flavor.1.t:0 "A Dry NYC?"
NYC_flavor.1.d:0 "Seeking to fulfill a campaign promise to his elitist and conservative Protestant voter base, while also staying in line with his own personal teetotaler lifestyle, Mayor Fred Trump and his Reform Party have pushed to introduce Prohibition into the Big Apple. Though Prohibition failed to pass on the national level before the outbreak of the 2ACW, it did pass in some states and counties, and the memory of such an idea has not gone out peacefully. The Trump administration has introduced this new ‘dry’ bill to the Senate, and now the wider government of the Big Apple is currently voting on its outcome. Though many view this to be a good, moral, and pious cause that will better the moral fiber of NYC while alieving some of society's darkest ailments, many others believe this to be an infringement on personal liberties and freedoms inherent in being part of the old Union. Furthermore, the Mob and other criminal outfits have viscerally opposed this bill, seeing it as an attack on their enterprise, while others simply see this as being bad for the economy. However, Trump is certain that alcohol not only breeds crime, but also corruption and laziness - especially among the Irish and within the Catholic-dominated NYPD. What is to be the fate of this divisive bill?"
NYC_flavor.1.a:0 "The bill passes! NYC is officially alcohol-free!"
NYC_flavor.1.b:0 "The bill fails! NYC is to remain a hive of scum and alcoholism."

NYC_flavor.2.t:0 "NYC to Remain a Den of Sin"
NYC_flavor.2.d:0 "Despite his campaigning and grandstanding in the Senate, Mayor Trump’s Dry Bill has failed. Despite this loss, there has been an upside to this political failure, for the many breweries, distillers, and vineyards within our nation have breathed a sigh of relief, allowing them to continue contributing to our economy. Funnily enough, the mob was also greatly relieved, not eager to resume underground bootlegging and risking prison time, and as such, all across NYC, the Reform Party has seen a small uptick in support while the economy has seen a small boom as well. Perhaps this failure was for the best in a city so closely tied to alcohol."
NYC_flavor.2.a:0 "Well, at least we can profit off it."

NYC_flavor.3.t:0 "Pushback to Prohibition"
NYC_flavor.3.d:0 "Despite the passing of the Dry Bill, which was a tremendous political win for the Trump administration, all's not well in the Big Apple. With an entire industry being banned overnight, our economy has taken a massive hit as the hundreds of vineyards, breweries, distilleries, and bars close down across NYC and Long Island. Furthermore, the Mob and other criminal outfits have been furious over this decision, but have taken back to a life of bootlegging and rum-running in order to capitalize on this new opportunity. With riots and crime rising across our nation, something must be done by the Trump administration in order to address these issues, for if he wishes for NYC to stay a Dry State, he is going to have to fight for it."
NYC_flavor.3.a:0 "Repeal the bill at once! Let alcohol flow into NYC once more."
NYC_flavor.3.b:0 "God guides us to know what is best. The bill stays, just hire more cops!"

NYC_flavor.4.t:0 "The City Finally Acclimates to the New Dry Era"
NYC_flavor.4.d:0 "After months of chaos and violence, crime and sin, the Big Apple has finally gotten used to Trump’s Prohibition bill. Though speakeasies and bootlegging are still around, they are far rarer than they were when Prohibition first began, and with the mob finally put back in its place by the newly expanded NYPD, the City that Never Sleeps is finally dry and safe. Now, we shall look to the future free of sin and drunkenness, under God and eager to start off on our reforged destiny."
NYC_flavor.4.a:0 "Finally, the City that Never Sleeps can rest."
