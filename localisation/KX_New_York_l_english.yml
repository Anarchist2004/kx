### Events ###
NYC.0.t:0 "The ‘City that Never Sleeps’ Now Burns"
NYC.0.d:0 "Sitting at the end of the mighty Hudson like a wondrous pearl washed towards the sea, New York was once the largest city in the now-dying Union, and perhaps even the greatest metropolis on Earth. First settled by the Dutch in 1624, the once sleepy and unassuming coastal colony that was New Amsterdam would evolve overtime to turn into the bustling, ever-awake center of global economics and culture that it is today, doing the impossible to become the urban crown jewel of the old United States. However, the golden era that brought NYC to this breathtaking pinnacle has been abruptly cut short, and now the infamous Big Apple burns much like the rest of the dying Union. \n\nThe outbreak of the Second American Civil War spelled doom for the American nation and its people, with families and friends torn apart as political tensions sparked factionalism and violence. These divisions were seen across the faltering nation, from the Pacific Coast to the Deep South to even the outlying Unincorporated Territories and beyond. However, due to the close-quarters nature and sheer density of the Northeastern Metropolis, these tensions and acts of violence and political expression were far more cutthroat and intense here in the Big Apple than perhaps anywhere else in the nation. Being the most densely populated region in the nation while simultaneously standing as a melting pot of diverse cultures and viewpoints, New York City became a bloody microcosm of the wider Civil War. Given its location and key importance, the Syndicalist and Federalist factions both claimed the City as their own, with this being evident in the streets as separate borders and barricades rose in this new urban hell. Neighbor fought neighbor and brother slaughtered brother as the cosmopolitan nature of the metropolis turned against it. Socialist unions and militias from the City’s vast industrial sectors took up arms against the New York Police department as the various crime syndicates feasted on the chaos. The Brooklyn Shipyards and local naval bases devolved into infighting as Federalist and Syndicalist-aligned sailors turned on each other in order to secure the vast fleets dry-docked for repairs and refits. Wall Street devolved into bloodshed as Socialist made a run on the financial sector only to be met by the guns of the NYPD and Tammany Hall forces who had taken to the rooftops to defend their assets. Makeshift fortresses and blockades littered the streets and alleys, with Broadway turning into a No Man’s Land littered with shell craters and bodies only disturbed by the shudder of canons or the screams of scavengers and looters caught in the machine gun fire of a passing patrol or encamped hardpoint. The city that never slept was kept constantly awake by the blood-curdling horrors and cacophony of endless war, but somehow, the City held firm. \n\nWhat was once a glistening example of the American Dream is now a blood-soaked ruin, and at the center of it all is Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who has rallied the bulk of the City’s non-radicals under a temporary banner for peace and for the preservation of NYC. Elected in 1933, La Guardia was the first Italian mayor of the city and the first mayor in decades to be free from the corrupt Democrat political machine known as Tammany Hall. With the City now independent - having fended off the selfish desires of both Chicago and Washington, Mayor La Guardia has become the main executive of the city, and to many, its final protector. Standing in the middle of fighting Socialists, police officers, mobsters, Democrats, opportunists, Federalists, and more, few envy La Guardia’s position, but despite an upcoming emergency election, his determination to save his city has not wavered. Navigating the minefields, both political and literal, of his war-torn city, it is up to La Guardia to attempt to bring peace to this hellzone. However, with numerous forces circling ‘Little Flower’ as he is sometimes called, La Guardia must act fast lest he lose his position to more power-hungry forces."
NYC.0.a:0 "We must act quickly to stop the rot from decaying our glorious Big Apple."

NYC.1.t:0 "Snap Elections for the Mayor of NYC"
NYC.1.desc:0 "With the Big Apple now free from warring Syndicalists and Federalists that nearly destroyed our metropolis, we too have become free of the only unifying force keeping Mayor La Guardia’s engorged Fusion Party ticket together. With the writing on the wall and with the City in desperate need of a resolved, or perhaps even new, direction, the La Guardia administration called for new snap elections - a first for the City. In the chaos that has surrounded the hasty organization of this new election, four men have risen to become prime contenders for the new title of Mayor of New York City. \n\nDefending his mandate and his administration stands Fiorello La Guardia, the incumbent Republican mayor touted by many as ‘the Man who saved New York.’ Despite setbacks and the near-complete collapse of his Fusion Party coalition, La Guardia is still in a strong position to win re-election, though it is far from as assured as it was just a few short months ago. Despite the chaos, he still seeks to institute the New Deal - a progressive socioeconomic plan partially developed years prior during his time working with the late Franklin Roosevelt - to boost and equalize the economy while safeguarding true American democracy within the City. His prime opponent vying for the same support base is Orson Welles and his Labor Party, largely seen as the ‘Good Syndicalist’ despite desperate attempts to distance himself from Syndicalism and Revolutionary Leftist ideas. Welles is running on a campaign of egalitarian social justice, progressive social democracy, and patronage of the vibrant New York cultural scene in a fair social capitalist system. Further to the Left of Welles, John Steinbeck has also thrown his hat in the ring. Having united the remaining Syndicalist and Socialiest cells within the City limits as well as those Leftists disillusioned by Welles’s moderate and compromised approach, Steinbeck seeks to bring about a peaceful Socialist reformation while dodging claims that he is a spy or agent of the CSA or the Third Internationale. These accusations however have not stopped his message of equality and economic redistribution from resonating with the city's extensive urban poor, giving him a strong chance to swipe the election from behind. Finally there is Fred Trump, a real estate magnate who has become the figurehead for big business and free-market capitalist interests within the Big Apple with his Reform Party - a splinter from Tammany Hall with ties to the Old Democratic Party down south. He wants to turn the City that Never Sleeps into a modern Venice where government and business go hand in hand to encourage the prosperity of the state. However his track record with dodging taxes and equality laws while funding and supporting the ODP and the KKK have made many wary of his promises, but they can do little to stop his powerful backers and the torrent of support he has from former Tammany supporters. \n\nWith these candidates all poised to lead the City at this turbulent and crucial crossroads, it is truly anyone’s race as the election draws near."

NYC.2.d:0 "As our newly independent New York settles into the reality of being a free city-state, along with all the benefits and dangers such a existence provides, our first major post-independence obstacle has reared its ugly head. Although the new administration has settled into its seats and even with Mayor [root.getleader] already beginning measures to restabilize the City, chaos still reigns in the Big Apple. From Flatbush to Astoria, from Bed-Stuy to Riverdale, all of NYC is abuzz and aflame as looters, rioters, and other degenerate opportunists ransack our beloved city in what is being quickly known as ‘The Great Crime Wave of [root.getyear].’ The city streets twinkle with the broken glass of storefront windows and run red with the blood of innocent and guilty alike as crime threatens to completely consume the City that Never Sleeps. Seeking to capitalize on the anarchy, the Commission headed by Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky along with Murder Inc. and the Five Families have taken this moment of weakness to make their move to corner more of the city. The NYPD has done its best to fight back against this menace but, out of fear of escalating the situation, the Mayor has held them back. Many wonder how long this can go on as the City dances on the balcony above anarchy and hedonism."
NYC.2.a:0 "Let's hope we can deal with this."

NYC.3.t:0 "The Great Crime Wave Further Floods the City in Chaos"
NYC.3.d:0 " Despite the best efforts of the NYPD and in spite of the political machinations of the various ideological factions tearing the City apart, the Mob and lesser criminal organizations have only grown more bold. Mafiosos raid apartment blocks and police stations alike while squads of the Boys in Blue have been pushed out entirely of whole neighborhoods like Little Italy, with nearly all of the Bronx and Brooklyn already in Mafia control with the rest of the boroughs likely to follow. The situation has grown dire and Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine has met with the Mayor personally to argue his case. Chief Valentine has demanded that the restrictions on the police be relaxed or abolished entirely, and that the police force be augmented by the NYC City Guards and the armories be opened immediately, so that the NYPD can properly defend the City from the radicals and criminals that besiege it. The Mayor is still hesitant to comply however, citing that such a move would only cause further panic, so it would seem that the political administration is now useless in this matter. However, history will happen without the permission of these fat-cat plutocrats or with it, and something must be done now - the only question is what. With the fate of the city in play, does Chief Valentine listen to his orders and let NYC be consumed in crime, or does the NYPD break free of convention to save the city?"

NYC.300.d:0 "The NYPD, restrained and hobbled into incompetence, have given up the fight. Police officers are quitting en masse and those that remain refuse to leave their stations. On the streets outside the Mob has taken over. The final nail was struck when the Mob marched into City Hall and literally threw out the Mayor. With the Police having washed their hands of the situation and the City Guard too busy keeping the Civil War on the other side of the border, the Mob now reigns over NYC."

NYC.301.d:0 "The NYPD has done what many thought impossible. After getting the go ahead by the Mayor the police have begun to launch an all out assault on the Mob. City Guard units led assaults on known Mob hideouts. Mobsters were executed by the dozen and the Five Families fractured under the pressure. Mobsters began to flip or flee and by now only the most die hard mobsters remain in the city. However they know their power is broken and will take decades to recover, if at all. In celebration of his victory, Police Chief Valentine held a victory parade through the streets of New York. Afterwards Valentine, in a shocking move that few had the chance or, at the time at least, will to resist, he announced the Mayor had been arrested four hours prior. Valentine accused him of letting the city fall into anarchy and wanting to hand over the city's precious independence to whoever won the Civil War. Now however, as City Commissioner, Valentine pledged to make New York safe, secure and prosperous."

NYC.5.t:0 "Leadership Convention"
NYC.5.d:0 "Today the heads of the Five Families gathered in a discrete location, more out of habit than necessity, to decide which one of them would become the public face of the Mob’s rule over the City. Quickly three main candidates came to the forefront of discussion. The first was Charles “Lucky” Luciano. He is the leader of the Commission and its founder while also being one of if not the most powerful mobster in New York City’s underworld. He is also widely known and popular among the people for his generosity to the poor. Secondly came Meyer Lansky, who has grown fantastically rich off of his gambling empire. He was seen as a compromise candidate between Luciano and Siegel’s supporters. Not only that, Lansky, along with Siegel, are not Italians and therefore are not made men. Finally there comes Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel. He opposes Luciano’s ambition to keep the Mob the public face of the regime and Lansky’s plans to “straighten up” the mob through more legitimate revenue streams. Instead he wants to put some lowly puppet in place as ruler and let the Mob return to its role as the power behind the throne, a position it had enjoyed in years prior."

NYC.50.d:0 "With our power secured the Mayor has decided the time is right to go after Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall, otherwise known as the Society of St Tammany, is infamous in New York. It is a political machine, controlling Democratic votes and wielding tremendous amounts of influence in the City and the State as a whole. Under the infamous “Boss Tweed” its corruption became public and since then it has only gotten more and more reviled. Now, with our nation independent and secure, we must weed out this fountain of corruption. The NYPD is primed and ready to raid its offices and bring its leaders in. However, its power and influence runs deep and the risks of this blowing up in our face are high. What will we do?"

NYC.7.d:0 "Wall Street was the symbol of American prosperity. Before the Depression it was the financial hub of the world, its rise dragged the rest of the world up with it, and its fall also took the rest of the world with it. The Depression, the pre-Civil War instability and our fight for freedom have done a number on the Street with many of its buildings long closed and the Stock Market laying mostly abandoned even still. However, with the situation in our nation stable we have decided to take a firm policy towards the Street. Some on the left wing of our administration have argued that we should close it down entirely. They decry it as the jewel in the crown of capitalism and if we were to destroy it we could make a newer humane economy on its ashes. However, our right leaning compatriots predictably have the opposite view. They point to the prosperity of the early 1900s and the titans of industry it created as proof that the Street must be saved. They argue that if we go about destroying the very foundations of American capitalism like the Stock Market then we could do irreparable harm to the economy. We must make a decision."

There are some things an upstanding government like ours cant be caught doing. Like liquidating dangerous seditious elements within our borders for example. This proposal offers us an alliance with the Mob which will strike our enemies in return for a weakened grip. This could be very beneficial to us as using them we could do much to secure our rule. However, many others within our government have argued that if we do this then we are no better than the despots of old and new. They say that to ally with the Mob would also give them way too much power."

Whomever they choose, it will be Tammany who comes out on top. Tammany has had its fingers deep in the Apple pie for a long time now, but now the city lies in the tiger's mouth and there is nothing to pull it back out."

NYC.15.d:0 "With the Council sitting on their thumbs its up to us, the Bosses of Tammany Hall, to come to a decision on who is to lead the city. One candidate is George Olvany, former head of the Hall. He had resigned after false accusations of corruption relating to using his influence to enrich his law firm. We know these accusations are baseless and have been stricken from the record. He promises a return to the prominence of Tammany in NYC and wants to expand its influence across the rest of the US, not just NYC. Next there is Jimmy Walker. Walker was the last Tammany mayor of NYC, at least until now, and was forced to resign due to a corruption scandal. Again, the accusations have no merit and the DA is going to strike them from his record so he can run in the mayoral election if we let him. The people already know Walker and while he did have some hiccups in the past it won't be hard to paper over them to restore his reputation and as a former public figure his election would be a lot more palpable to the people."
