### Focuses ###
NYC_big_apple:0 "The Big Apple Breaks Free"
NYC_big_apple_desc:0 "Known by many names, such as the City that Never Sleeps or simply the City, the most curious and vibrant of all names for New York is the Big Apple. New York, or as it is more commonly known as New York City to differentiate it from the state it has now seceded from, now drifts towards its new destiny alone and untethered. Maneuvering between Syndicalist and Federalist forces, NYC has skinned by and now stands as an independent city-state on the brink of internal collapse. With gangs and looters rioting in the streets as Leftist cells fight local National Guard regiments, the crumbling coalition that is the Fusion Party of incumbent mayor Fiorello La Guardia now must attempt to steer this rickety ship towards safe harbor, lest the whole city sink beneath the waves of radicalism and chaos."
NYC_election:0 "The Sudden Election"
NYC_election_desc:0 "With his coalition that is the Fusion Party crumbling around him, Mayor La Guardia and his administration has called for sudden snap elections in order to reassure the people of NYC that he is devoted to the democratic process and willing to do what is best for the City at large. However, with his party falling apart, La Guardia and his Republican supporters now face staunch competition, and the easy win he so desperately expected is but a distant delusion. It is sure to be a close race as the future of America’s largest city, and the nearly 8 million souls within it, dangles in the balance."

NYC_reelect_laguardia:0 "Reelect La Guardia"
NYC_reelect_laguardia_desc:0 "Facing off against political opponents hungry to take his place while also seeking to maintain stability in his beloved Big Apple, Fiorello H. La Guardia and his Fusion ticket based around the Republican Party have eked out a victory in the recent snap elections. As such, Fiorello La Guardia - the Little Flower and Mayor 99 - has been re-elected as Mayor of New York City! Under his continued administration, NYC will strive towards becoming the fair, free, and equal Liberal Capitalist paradise it was always meant to be as La Guardia seeks to use his New Deal to transform the Big Apple into a shining city upon the hill."
NYC_new_york_new_deal:0 "New York, New Deal"
NYC_new_york_new_deal_desc:0 "Building off the work of his past allies while incorporating his own ideas, Mayor La Guardia has announced the creation of his new social program dubbed the New Deal. Centered around the ‘3 R’s’ of relief for the unemployed, the poor, and those whose lives have been destroyed by the war, recovery of the economy to pre-collapse levels, and reforms of the financial system along liberal and egalitarian lines in order to prevent such a disaster from happening again. This New Deal shall become the foundation of La Guardia’s agenda as the Mayor seeks to bring prosperity, liberty, and equality to New York City."
NYC_sweep_tammany_aside:0 "Sweep Tammany Aside"
NYC_sweep_tammany_aside_desc:0 "Tammany Hall has long been a thorn in the side of fair and free New Yorker democracy. Their proclivity for corruption and towards self-serving ambitions have hampered New York’s pursuit of a glorious destiny, and as such, this cancerous, corrupt, and undemocratic tumor must be excised once and for all. The Society of St. Tammany shall be banned from organizing, and their main members and bosses will be put to trial by La Guarida and his trusty ally District Attorney Thomas Dewey. Under their watch, the La Guardia administration shall poach the Tammany Tiger once and for all."
NYC_harsh_anti_corruption:0 "Harsh Anti-Corruption Measures"
NYC_harsh_anti_corruption_desc:0 "La Guardia built his reputation around a staunch stance against corruption, graft, and other forms of parasitic selfishness that afflicted the Big Apple, and with his mandate once again secured, he has moved to make good on this promise. An anti-occupation wave will sweep this city, washing away sin and hedonistic excess in a purifying wave of law and order. Crime and corruption have no place in our New York, and La Guardia is the hero we need to champion this exterminatory effort."
NYC_clean_up_the_city:0 "Clean Up the City"
NYC_clean_up_the_city_desc:0 "With his anti-corruption measures already in order and showing the first blossoms of good results, Mayor La Guardia has moved to expand this ‘sanitation’ effort to all aspects of New Yorker society. A new idea of ‘cleaning up the City’ is to be spread as the La Guardia administration moves to cleanse and purify all aspects of NYC. Street cleaning and garbage pick up are being organized and made efficient. The sewage system is being expanded and modernized. NYPD anti-corruption measures are being expanded as new recruits are hired and trained en masse to better combat the organized crime problem. Internal affairs divisions are even being created across the government and its offices, providing accountability and an inside man into every branch of the metropolitan system, ensuring there is a system of checks and balances on every department in the City. With these initiatives and more, NYC shall be made the greatest city on Earth once again!"
NYC_democratic_unity:0 "Democratic Unity"
NYC_democratic_unity_desc:0 "Mayor La Guardia made NYC history as its first Italian mayor, running on his Fusion ticket - a big-tent unity coalition composed of his main base within the Republican Party as well as various elements from across the spectrum that came together in order to preserve New York democracy. Though this Fusion ticket has fractured and shrunk, La Guardia still enjoys the respect and support of many elements that were once part of his coalition as well as other like-minded representatives from across NYC’s political scene. With this in mind, it should be no issue for the La Guardia administration to drum up support and camaraderie between like-minded parties and groups within the stabilized political stage of the City. Together, we shall build a better and more free city for all to enjoy, while those who oppose us shall be relegated to a tiny and ineffectual minority."
NYC_public_works:0 "Public Works Programs"
NYC_public_works_desc:0 "In order to kickstart the local economy while also combating the vicious specter that is mass unemployment, Mayor La Guardia has passed an initiative that will provide numerous public works jobs for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers. This new public works program will have these previously jobless louts now provide their manpower and skills to numerous efforts regarding municipal expansion, from the creation of new housing blocks and subway tunnels to new roadways and even public art installations. No matter what the task, we will provide the men and the supplies, and in turn these men shall be paid for their services, hopefully breathing life back into our struggling economy."
NYC_reform_civil_service:0 "Reform the Civil Service"
NYC_reform_civil_service_desc:0 "Seeking to replace the patronage system that has long been rife with corruption and ineptitude, Mayor La Guardia has moved forward to fulfill his campaign promise of reforming the civil service. Shifting towards a merit-based civil service funded, trained, and overseen by the state, La Guardia hopes to cut down on corruption and nepotism within the metropolitan bureaucracy while expanding jobs and further meeting the administrative needs of the state."
NYC_break_free_from_banks:0 "Break Free From the Banks"
NYC_break_free_from_banks_desc:0 "Yet another campaign promise of Mayor La Guardia was to restore financial health and to break free from the control of the corrupt banker class. For too long, capitalist barons and bank magnates have dominated the financial system of NYC, especially around Wall Street. In order to break this control, La Guardia’s administration has launched a full on attack of the NYC banking structure, strongarming these merchants of misery to lower interest rates, expand credit and loan availability, and other acts of better business in order to stop these oppressive capitalists from strangling the lowest classes of the City ever again."
NYC_work_releif_program:0 "Create the Work Projects Administration"
NYC_work_releif_program_desc:0 "Establishing the Works Projects Administration of New York, Mayor La Guardia has created a program aimed at employing the unemployed masses in order to build and repair the infrastructure and public amenities of the city. From roads and subways to parks and museums, all of NYC shall be modernized and made anew upon the backs of our own dedicated but down on their luck citizenry. With these jobs, they shall be tossed back into the economy as productive members while also modernizing our city in the process."
NYC_modernize_infrastructure:0 "Modernize and Expand Infrastructure"
NYC_modernize_infrastructure_desc:0 "Furthering the initial infrastructure work started by the WPA, Mayor La Guardia has authorized a specific initiative aimed at fully modernizing the infrastructure of the City. With new bridges, new highways, new parkways, new subway tunnels, new railyards, new dockyards, and more, NYC shall be made the best connected city on Earth!"
NYC_shining_beacon:0 "The Shining Beacon City"
NYC_shining_beacon_desc:0 "Under the guidance of Mayor La Guardia and his political allies, New York City has transformed into the prodigal shining city upon the hill. Our City is a liberal beacon for all the world to behold, and here on our miniature archipelago we stand as an inspiration for all to witness and hope to aspire to. Our factories hum to life without end, our people are fed, clothed, and with jobs. Our docks are filled with trade ships flying flags of every nation, and the culture of New York thrives like never before. Our City is a paradise on Earth, and under Mayor La Guardia, may we continue to shine for all eternity!"
NYC_talk_to_the_people:0 "La Guarida’s Fireside Chats"
NYC_talk_to_the_people_desc:0 "In order to reach each and every soul within his city, Mayor La Guardia has begun a weekly radio program in which he addresses his fellow New Yorkers, discussing recent events and news as well as the direction and future plans of his administration and the City at large. Broadcasting to every radio in the nation, as well as the odd television in the richer homes, Mayor La Guardia will be sitting fireside with his cigar and brandy each week, warming the hearts and easing the minds of all New Yorkers for years to come."
NYC_expand_parks:0 "Expand Central Park and the Gardens"
NYC_expand_parks_desc:0 "A personal pet project of the Mayor, a new initiative has begun to expand, renovate, and restore the various gardens and natural venues of the City. From Van Cortlandt and Central Park to the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, all venues will be funded and made anew with funding from the La Guardia administration, for these are our only local greeneries, and as such, they must be protected and preserved."

NYC.0.t:0 "The ‘City that Never Sleeps’ Now Burns"
NYC.0.d:0 "Sitting at the end of the mighty Hudson like a wondrous pearl washed towards the sea, New York was once the largest city in the now-dying Union, and perhaps even the greatest metropolis on Earth. First settled by the Dutch in 1624, the once sleepy and unassuming coastal colony that was New Amsterdam would evolve overtime to turn into the bustling, ever-awake center of global economics and culture that it is today, doing the impossible to become the urban crown jewel of the old United States. However, the golden era that brought NYC to this breathtaking pinnacle has been abruptly cut short, and now the infamous Big Apple burns much like the rest of the dying Union. \n\nThe outbreak of the Second American Civil War spelled doom for the American nation and its people, with families and friends torn apart as political tensions sparked factionalism and violence. These divisions were seen across the faltering nation, from the Pacific Coast to the Deep South to even the outlying Unincorporated Territories and beyond. However, due to the close-quarters nature and sheer density of the Northeastern Metropolis, these tensions and acts of violence and political expression were far more cutthroat and intense here in the Big Apple than perhaps anywhere else in the nation. Being the most densely populated region in the nation while simultaneously standing as a melting pot of diverse cultures and viewpoints, New York City became a bloody microcosm of the wider Civil War. Given its location and key importance, the Syndicalist and Federalist factions both claimed the City as their own, with this being evident in the streets as separate borders and barricades rose in this new urban hell. Neighbor fought neighbor and brother slaughtered brother as the cosmopolitan nature of the metropolis turned against it. Socialist unions and militias from the City’s vast industrial sectors took up arms against the New York Police department as the various crime syndicates feasted on the chaos. The Brooklyn Shipyards and local naval bases devolved into infighting as Federalist and Syndicalist-aligned sailors turned on each other in order to secure the vast fleets dry-docked for repairs and refits. Wall Street devolved into bloodshed as Socialist made a run on the financial sector only to be met by the guns of the NYPD and Tammany Hall forces who had taken to the rooftops to defend their assets. Makeshift fortresses and blockades littered the streets and alleys, with Broadway turning into a No Man’s Land littered with shell craters and bodies only disturbed by the shudder of canons or the screams of scavengers and looters caught in the machine gun fire of a passing patrol or encamped hardpoint. The city that never slept was kept constantly awake by the blood-curdling horrors and cacophony of endless war, but somehow, the City held firm. \n\nWhat was once a glistening example of the American Dream is now a blood-soaked ruin, and at the center of it all is Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who has rallied the bulk of the City’s non-radicals under a temporary banner for peace and for the preservation of NYC. Elected in 1933, La Guardia was the first Italian mayor of the city and the first mayor in decades to be free from the corrupt Democrat political machine known as Tammany Hall. With the City now independent - having fended off the selfish desires of both Chicago and Washington, Mayor La Guardia has become the main executive of the city, and to many, its final protector. Standing in the middle of fighting Socialists, police officers, mobsters, Democrats, opportunists, Federalists, and more, few envy La Guardia’s position, but despite an upcoming emergency election, his determination to save his city has not wavered. Navigating the minefields, both political and literal, of his war-torn city, it is up to La Guardia to attempt to bring peace to this hellzone. However, with numerous forces circling ‘Little Flower’ as he is sometimes called, La Guardia must act fast lest he lose his position to more power-hungry forces."
NYC.0.a:0 "We must act quickly to stop the rot from decaying our glorious Big Apple."

NYC.1.t:0 "Snap Elections for the Mayor of NYC"
NYC.1.desc:0 "With the Big Apple now free from warring Syndicalists and Federalists that nearly destroyed our metropolis, we too have become free of the only unifying force keeping Mayor La Guardia’s engorged Fusion Party ticket together. With the writing on the wall and with the City in desperate need of a resolved, or perhaps even new, direction, the La Guardia administration called for new snap elections - a first for the City. In the chaos that has surrounded the hasty organization of this new election, four men have risen to become prime contenders for the new title of Mayor of New York City. \n\nDefending his mandate and his administration stands Fiorello La Guardia, the incumbent Republican mayor touted by many as ‘the Man who saved New York.’ Despite setbacks and the near-complete collapse of his Fusion Party coalition, La Guardia is still in a strong position to win re-election, though it is far from as assured as it was just a few short months ago. Despite the chaos, he still seeks to institute the New Deal - a progressive socioeconomic plan partially developed years prior during his time working with the late Franklin Roosevelt - to boost and equalize the economy while safeguarding true American democracy within the City. His prime opponent vying for the same support base is Orson Welles and his Labor Party, largely seen as the ‘Good Syndicalist’ despite desperate attempts to distance himself from Syndicalism and Revolutionary Leftist ideas. Welles is running on a campaign of egalitarian social justice, progressive social democracy, and patronage of the vibrant New York cultural scene in a fair social capitalist system. Further to the Left of Welles, John Steinbeck has also thrown his hat in the ring. Having united the remaining Syndicalist and Socialiest cells within the City limits as well as those Leftists disillusioned by Welles’s moderate and compromised approach, Steinbeck seeks to bring about a peaceful Socialist reformation while dodging claims that he is a spy or agent of the CSA or the Third Internationale. These accusations however have not stopped his message of equality and economic redistribution from resonating with the city's extensive urban poor, giving him a strong chance to swipe the election from behind. Finally there is Fred Trump, a real estate magnate who has become the figurehead for big business and free-market capitalist interests within the Big Apple with his Reform Party - a splinter from Tammany Hall with ties to the Old Democratic Party down south. He wants to turn the City that Never Sleeps into a modern Venice where government and business go hand in hand to encourage the prosperity of the state. However his track record with dodging taxes and equality laws while funding and supporting the ODP and the KKK have made many wary of his promises, but they can do little to stop his powerful backers and the torrent of support he has from former Tammany supporters. \n\nWith these candidates all poised to lead the City at this turbulent and crucial crossroads, it is truly anyone’s race as the election draws near."
NYC.1.b:0 "The progressive laborist and famous actor Orson Welles wins the day."
NYC.1.a:0 "’The ‘Little Flower’ La Guardia - the bastion of New York Liberalism - is reelected!"
NYC.1.c:0 "The beloved author and peaceful Socialist John Steinbeck is elected."
NYC.1.e:0 "Fred Trump and his conservative, market-oriented Reform party steal a surprise win."

NYC.2.t:0 "The Great Crime Wave of [GetYear]"
NYC.2.d:0 "As our newly independent New York settles into the reality of being a free city-state, along with all the benefits and dangers such a existence provides, our first major post-independence obstacle has reared its ugly head. Although the new administration has settled into its seats and even with Mayor [root.getleader] already beginning measures to restabilize the City, chaos still reigns in the Big Apple. From Flatbush to Astoria, from Bed-Stuy to Riverdale, all of NYC is abuzz and aflame as looters, rioters, and other degenerate opportunists ransack our beloved city in what is being quickly known as ‘The Great Crime Wave of [GetYear].’ The city streets twinkle with the broken glass of storefront windows and run red with the blood of innocent and guilty alike as crime threatens to completely consume the City that Never Sleeps. Seeking to capitalize on the anarchy, the Commission headed by Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky along with Murder Inc. and the Five Families have taken this moment of weakness to make their move to corner more of the city. The NYPD has done its best to fight back against this menace but, out of fear of escalating the situation, the Mayor has held them back. Many wonder how long this can go on as the City dances on the balcony above anarchy and hedonism."
NYC.2.a:0 "Let's hope we can deal with this."

NYC.3.t:0 "The Great Crime Wave Further Floods the City in Chaos"
NYC.3.d:0 " Despite the best efforts of the NYPD and in spite of the political machinations of the various ideological factions tearing the City apart, the Mob and lesser criminal organizations have only grown more bold. Mafiosos raid apartment blocks and police stations alike while squads of the Boys in Blue have been pushed out entirely of whole neighborhoods like Little Italy, with nearly all of the Bronx and Brooklyn already in Mafia control with the rest of the boroughs likely to follow. The situation has grown dire and Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine has met with the Mayor personally to argue his case. Chief Valentine has demanded that the restrictions on the police be relaxed or abolished entirely, and that the police force be augmented by the NYC City Guards and the armories be opened immediately, so that the NYPD can properly defend the City from the radicals and criminals that besiege it. The Mayor is still hesitant to comply however, citing that such a move would only cause further panic, so it would seem that the political administration is now useless in this matter. However, history will happen without the permission of these fat-cat plutocrats or with it, and something must be done now - the only question is what. With the fate of the city in play, does Chief Valentine listen to his orders and let NYC be consumed in crime, or does the NYPD break free of convention to save the city?"
NYC.3.a:0 "The Mafia takes the final bite out of the Big Apple"
NYC.3.b:0 "The Police let slip the dogs of war."

NYC.300.t:0 "The Commission Seizes on the Chaos"
NYC.300.d:0 "The NYPD, restrained and hobbled into incompetence, has given up the fight. Police officers are quitting en masse as on-duty officers abandon their posts across the city, while the dedicated few dig in and prepare to fight the overwhelming tide of mobsters and gangsters to the bitter and honorable end. All across the city, mob rule reigns supreme, with the Police Headquarters at Centre and Broome Streets being one of the last blocks still solidly in Police hands. The final nail in the old regime’s coffin was struck when mafioso forces marched onto City Hall and literally threw the Mayor out of office after slaughtering many of the lower officials inside, with one mayoral aid notably dying by gunshot through the eye-glasses while getting a massage. With the Police having washed their hands of the situation and the resident National Guard too busy keeping the Civil War on the other side of the border, the Commission now rules the Big Apple."
NYC.300.a:0 "An apple, truly rotten to the core."

NYC.301.t:0 "The Police Stop the Madness"
NYC.301.d:0 "The NYPD has done what many thought impossible - they have saved NYC from itself. After getting the go ahead by the Mayor to act without restrictions, the police immediately began an all out assault on the Mob citywide. National Guard units aided by the Boys in Blue have made assaults on all known major Mob hideouts, flushing the rats out all at once. Mobsters and crime bosses have been gunned down and executed by the dozen and the Five Families have fractured under the pressure. Mob affiliates have begun to flee the city en masses, while others have thrown in with the NYPD seeking amnesty or even rewards, leaving only the most die hard mobsters remaining in the city. However they know their power is broken and will take decades to recover, if at all, for the age of terror these criminal have wrought is over. In celebration of his victory, Police Chief Valentine has held a victory parade through the streets of New York, with Broadway lit up in excitement for the first time in months. \n\nAll was not normal however, for the City now stood as a fundamentally changed setting. After the dust settled and as the trash from the parade was cleared from the street, Chief Valentine, in a shocking move that few had the chance or will to resist, announced the now-former Mayor had been arrested during the celebrations, stunning the city. Chief Valentine accused him of letting the city fall into anarchy, and as such has denounced him as being unfit for duty. In his stead, Lewis J. Valentine has named himself as ‘interim’ Mayor without any word of when his term would end, if ever."
NYC.301.a:0 "Fidelus ad Mortem"

NYC.4.t:0 "Every Crime Syndicate Needs its Boss"
NYC.4.d:0 "With literal Mob rule now secured over the City, the Commission has found itself in unfamiliar waters. It had operated for years in the shadows, trying its best to stay out of the limelight and its members out of jail or the grave. Now, however, it has placed itself as front and center as it possibly could, for the City that Never Sleeps now dances in the moonlight with criminals and crooks. With the faceless Commission dominating metropolitan affairs, the public has begged for a return to some form of normalcy, and keen on keeping power, the mobsters have hatched a plan. \n\nBefore the chaos that befalls us now consumed the city, just a few short years ago, the Five Families were divided as gang war ate away at the foundations of societal order. This came to a head in the Castellammarese War as the largest crime boss in the City at the time Don Salvator Maranzano tried to force the Five Families to name him the ‘Boss of Bosses’ - or ‘Capo di Tutti i Capi’, which ended with the murder of Maranzano and the rise of Luciano’s Commission. Since this crime war, no single soul has called the shots in the Big Apple’s criminal underground, but the people of the City expect a central figure to rally around. To alleviate this need and to move towards stability and some shred of true statehood, the Commission has decided to take this haughty term ‘Boss of Bosses’ in stride, and have announced that they will internally choose a new Capo di Tutti i Capi to be the public face of the City’s new shadow regime - a Mayor by any other name. With this decision now declared, the City and the Commission now prepare to raise one of their own up to be Mayor of NYC - a prospect no mobster ever thought possible before these troubling times."
NYC.4.a:0 "Gather the Godfathers!"

NYC.5.t:0 "The Commission Convenes to Choose a ‘Capo di Tutti i Capi’"
NYC.5.d:0 "Today, the leading members of the Commission - chiefly represented by Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky - as well as Murder Inc. and the heads of the Five Families all gathered in a discrete location - more out of habit than necessity - to decide which one of them would become the public face of the Mob’s rule over the City. Though this group had learned their lesson on pooling resources and power into one single Don when Maranzano had to be put down just a few years ago, the Commission had decided that a face must rise to serve as the public image of our shadowy brotherhood. Mockingly taking Maranzano’s preferred term of ‘Capo di Tutti i Capi’ or the Boss of All Bosses, the group seeks to grant this newly-reformed moniker to one among them that will be the facade that stands between the people of New York City and the operations of our criminal syndicate - a criminal Mayor in sheep’s clothing. \n\nNaturally, the leading figures and founders of the Commission were the candidates that had been nominated by their peers to ‘lead’ them. The first was Charles ‘Lucky’ Luciano - a transplant from the Chicago Outfit with deep ties to Capone; ties that were sundered when Capone desired all of Chicago for himself forcing Luciano to relocate to the Big Apple nearly a decade ago. Luciano is the ringmaster of the Commission and its dominant co-founder while also being one of if not the most powerful mobsters in New York City’s underworld. He is also widely known and widely feared, being popular among the poor masses and immigrants of this metropolis for his generosity to the poor and minor adherence to pseudo-Socialist, ‘Caponeist’ ideas. Second to Luciano is his right hand man and fellow co-founder of the Commission Meyer Lansky, who has grown fantastically rich off of his gambling empire. Also a co-founder of Murder Inc., Lanksy - known warmly as the Mob’s Accountant - is seen as the compromise candidate between the dreams of Lucky Luciano and the ambition of Bugsy Siegel, and Lansky supports the idea of ‘going legit’ in order to bring in more profit and less heat. Finally, Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel stands as the head honcho of the hitsquad-for-hire Murder Inc. with a legion of Italian and Jewish gangsters and thugs behind him. Siegel opposes this idea of a National Crime Syndicate that Lansky and Luciano espouse, and instead seeks to restore the position of the Mob to its roots. Siegel champions the creation of a true ‘Boss of Bosses’ to lead the gangs of New York into a new golden age of criminal enterprise unfettered by law and drenched in blood. With the cards on the table and with everyone all-in, it's time for the Capo di Tutti i Capi - and in turn, the new ‘mayor’ of New York, to be chosen once and for all."
NYC.5.a:0 "Lucky Luciano wins in a landslide and moves to create the National Crime Syndicate!"
NYC.5.b:0 "Meyer Lansky steals the vote as the unity candidate!"
NYC.5.c:0 "Bugsy Siegel robs the show and now stands as the sole strongman of the Commission!"

NYC.50.t:0 "The Fate of Tammany Hall"
NYC.50.d:0 "With our power secured and with normalcy returning slowly to the City, the Mayor has decided the time is right to once again go after Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall, otherwise known as the Society of St Tammany, is infamous in New York for its corruptive and meddling ways, already having been disgraced during La Guardia’s first electoral win. Tammany Hall is a political machine, controlling Democratic votes and wielding tremendous amounts of influence in the City and beyond - particularly among Irish and Anglo citizens. Under the infamous ‘Boss Tweed,’ its corruption became public and since then it has only gotten more and more revile, with rumors of their mob ties and other unscrupulous activities abound. Now, with our nation independent and secure, we must weed out this fountain of corruption. The NYPD is primed and ready to raid its offices and bring its leaders in. However, its power and influence runs deep, and its pockets deeper, so the risks of this blowing up in our face are potentially high. What will we do?"
NYC.50.a:0 "Let them be. They have been defanged and disgraced enough."
NYC.50.b:0 "Time to Slay the Tammany Tiger once and for all!"

NYC.6.t:0 "Police Chief Lewis J. Valentine Retires"
NYC.6.d:0 "Lewis Joseph Valentine, longtime head of the NYPD, has finally retired after more than 11 years serving as Police Chief of NYC. His fight against corruption in the force has made him a favorable figure in many New Yorker’s minds, especially after his response to the Great Crime Wave that swept the City soon after our independence. Now, this hero of the City and paragon of justice heads home for the final time to live out his retirement with his beloved wife and children. In his place, Officer Arthur Wallander has been named as Police Commissioner in his stead. Now, it is up to Chief Wallander to fill the shoes of this titan of law and order."
NYC.6.a:0 "Chief Wallander rises to take the helm of the NYPD."

NYC.7.t:0 "The Fate of Wall Street"
NYC.7.d:0 "Wall Street was the symbol of American prosperity before its fiery crash during the Depression. Before that fall, it was the financial hub of the world, and its rise dragged the rest of the world up with it; and as such, its fall also took the rest of the world with it. The Great Depression, the pre-Civil War instability, and our fight for freedom have done a number on Wall Street, with many of its buildings long closed or in ruin, and with the Stock Market laying mostly abandoned even now. However, with the situation in our nation finally stable, we have decided to take a firm policy towards ‘the Street’. Socialists within the city detest the notion of Wall Street and wish to see it burned. They decry it as the center jewel in the crown of capitalism and if we were to destroy it we could make a newer, more humane economy on its ashes. However, the rest of the City predictably has the opposite view. They point to the prosperity of the early 1900s and the titans of industry it created as proof that the Street must be saved. They argue that if we go about destroying the very foundations of American capitalism like the Stock Market then we could do irreparable harm to the economy. We must make a decision."
NYC.7.a:0 "Burn away the last vestiges of this failed and gaudy system!"
NYC.7.b:0 "Leave it be. It will prove useful to us, to the economy, and to the rebuilding efforts."

NYC.8.t:0 "New York City Calls for Aid"
NYC.8.d:0 "We have received a message from the Free City of New York asking for emergency aid. The City is almost entirely urbanized and as such is dependent on foreign aid to survive, for it cannot grow its own food and relies on imports and a laughably meager fishing industry to feed its over 7 million people. They plead with us to send them food in return for lucrative business opportunities. If we deny them, we could weaken a potential economic rival. However, the suffering wrought at our hands if we were to condemn one of the most populous cities in the world to starvation would be unbearable to many within our cabinet and certainly would be a back look in the eyes of the masses. If we instead do send them aid, then we can increase our own influence within the City - a lucrative prize in one of the most profitable cities on Earth."
NYC.8.a:0 "We can't spare anything. Tell them we are sorry but we must decline."
NYC.8.b:0 "We will have the first shipment of food and supplies sent at once!"

NYC.9.t:0 "Aid Received!"
NYC.9.d:0 "Our pleas to the international community have not gone unheeded! Already the Port of NY is bustling with shipments from our new friends and the people rejoice to see the shelves filling once more. Starvation and certain doom have been avoided, and the City that Never Sleeps can keep on ticking once more."
NYC.9.a:0 "The party continues in the City that Never Sleeps!"

NYC.10.t:0 "Aid Refused!"
NYC.10.d:0 "Our pleas to the international community have seemingly fallen on deaf ears. Our people have begun to feel the pinch of hardship as ration cards are handed out for everything from wheat and water to toothpaste and radios. If something isn’t done soon, we may run out of the necessary foodstuffs and other supplies needed to keep the City alive."
NYC.10.a:0 "The City that Never Sleeps begins to doze off..."

NYC.11.t:0 "Utilize the Mob?"
NYC.11.d:0 "Some within our government have come to us with a proposal that would have us utilize the Mob for our own ends. The proposal suggests a backroom alliance with Luciano and Lansky’s Commission and their associates in Murder Inc., who would make our enemies sleep with the fishes or simply disappear in return for a weakened police presence and averted eyes to their less-obvious criminal dealings - provided they of course continue to grease the wheels of justice and statecraft with ample bribes. This could be very beneficial to us as using them could do much to secure our rule. However, there are some things an upstanding government like ours can't be caught doing, like liquidating dangerous seditious elements within our borders through illegally hired hitmen for example, and this is definitely one of them so it would have to be discreet. Furthermore, many others within our government have argued that if we do this, then we are no better than the despots of old and new or the very mobsters and murderers we would be dealing with. They say that to ally with the Mob would also give them way too much power, perhaps even putting our grip on power in jeopardy. What shall we do?"
NYC.11.a:0 "Burn that paper and never speak of this again, capiche?"
NYC.11.b:0 "There are no good choices in politics, only less bad ones. Agree to the plan."

NYC.12.t:0 "Tammany Hall Denounces Us"
NYC.12.d:0 "Our offensive against Tammany Hall has gone down in flames. The Society of St. Tammany has turned on us openly, launching a public smear campaign against the Mayor and his administration. Newsboys on street corners distribute pamphlets telling slanderous lies, flyers have shown up on telephone poles lampooning the government over the city's problems, and billboards in support of the Tammany Tiger have gone up across the city. All the while, Tammany politicians within the city have unleashed a full broadside against the Mayor’s office. Politically isolated and under attack on all sides, few expect the current administration to survive long."
NYC.12.a:0 "Mess with the Tiger, you get the claws."

NYC.14.t:0 "Tammany Hall Takes Down the Mayor"
NYC.14.d:0 "Tammany Hall’s odyssey of graft and conquest of NYC has once again come to a head as the Tiger wraps its claws around the Big Apple. In a somber announcement, Mayor [root.leader] has announced he along with his entire cabinet are resigning from their positions, effective immediately. In their place, a special governing body of city legislators has risen to form an interim administration until a new Deputy Mayor can be internally chosen. It's no surprise to anybody that this ‘council’ is made up nearly entirely of Tammany Hall loyalists, and as such, these corrupt Democrats are now wholly in control of the Big Apple. No matter who they choose, it is certain that it will be a Tammany Tiger who comes out on top."
NYC.14.a:0 "The Big Apple finally devoured by the Tammany Tiger"

NYC.15.t:0 "Tammany Hall Reclaims the Mayorship"
NYC.15.d:0 "With the interim government merely being an arm of Tammy Hall’s ambitions, it is now time for the Bosses of Tammany Hall to come to a decision on who is to lead the city. Before the Bosses are two prime candidates for the position, both with ample experience and political clout. The first candidate is George Washington Olvany, a conservative judge and former head of the Hall. Olvany had resigned after clearly false accusations of corruption relating to using his political influence to enrich his personal law firm. However, we know these accusations are baseless and have been justly stricken from the record. Olvany promises a traditionalist return to the prominence of Tammany Hall in NYC and wants to expand its influence across the rest of the USA. Opposing him is the infamous and divisive Jimmy ‘Beau James’ Walker. Walker was the last Tammany mayor of NYC, at least until now, and was forced to resign due to a corruption scandal like Olvany, but is back at it again with Tammany’s resurgence. Like Olvany as well, the charges against him have been cleared justly, and Walker walks as a free and lawful man once again thanks to Tammany Hall’s patronage. The people already know Walker, with his reputation as a sound Liberal champion being well-known, and while he did have some hiccups in the past it won't be hard to pave over them to restore his reputation. Additionally, as a former public figure his election would be a lot more palpable to the people. Regardless of who is chosen, Tammany Hall and its Bosses shall truly be in control."
NYC.15.a:0 "Go with the flamboyant liberal Jimmy ‘Beau James’ Walker."
NYC.15.b:0 "Go with the conservative justice George Washington Olvany."
