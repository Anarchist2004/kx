POLITICS_NICOLAAS_HAVENGA_DESC:0 "Nicolaas Christiaan Havenga, once a loyal supporter of the James Hertzog and the National Party, and perhaps an even more radical Afrikaner nationalist, left the party over disagreements with its economic policies. He founded the 'Progressive Party' in opposition to what was, in his view, the regressive economic platform of the National Party. As president, Havenga seeks to deregulate foreign trade and promote the exploitation of South Africa's vast gold deposits."
POLITICS_DANIEL_MALAN_DESC:0 "Daniel François Malan, former editor of the National Party's newspaper, Die Burger, has outmanoeuvred rival James Hertzog to secure dominance of South Africa's nationalist faction. Malan is, even by Afrikaner Nationalist standards, a hardline proponent of racial segregation and the suppression of South Africa's black population. As president, Malan strives to transform South Africa into a nation completely by and for the Afrikaner people, and by nearly any means necessary."
POLITICS_HERBERT_STANLEY_DESC:0 "Herbert James Stanley, British-Rhodesian political leader, with the death of Jan Christiaan Smuts, has become governor-general of the Dominion of South Africa. Stanley, an Englishman, seeks to foster even more resilient economic and political ties with Canada, while maintaining South Africa's independence."

SAF_mobile_force:0 "A Mobile Force"
SAF_mobile_force_desc:0 "The quality of our forces do not matter half so much as their mobility. This is a new era. and tactics of encirclement and reach are far more vital to victory than ever before. This must be the focus on South Africa's military future."

SAF_armored_corps:0 "The Armoured Corps"
SAF_armored_corps_desc:0 "Designing tanks with the capacity to operate in African lands is no small task. One must not be fooled by the large prairies surrounding the Cape, those tanks will inevitably face desert and jungle as they advance northwards. European roads are far from here."
SAF_mech_production:0 "Natal Motorworks"
SAF_mech_production_desc:0 "All the research into armour will not help us at all if we are not able to build it - we must nationalise a prominent vehicle manufacturer and build it into the centre of our growing armoured production core."

SAF_desert_air_force:0 "Desert Air Force"

SAF_naval_academy:0 "The Cape Town Naval Academy"

### Events ###
saf.1.t:0 "The Union of South Africa"
saf.1.d:0 "Formed in 1910 as a merger of the various British possessions in South Africa - the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and the Orange Free State - the Union of South Africa is currently a parliamentary republic, having seceded from the British Empire during the crisis of 1925. The British Revolution gave the anti-British coalition of the National and Labour Parties cause to break free from British influence that they had endured since the end of the 2nd Boer War (1899-1902). The first President of South Africa, James Hertzog, used the chaos to annex the neighbouring British protectorates of South Rhodesia, Bechuanaland, Basutoland, and Swaziland, while leaving the remainder of Britains African colonies to fall into the hands of the German Freistaat."
saf.1.a:0 "Union is Strength."

saf.2.t:0 "The Union's Constitution"
saf.2.d:0 "South Africa's current constitution is an adaption of the 1909 South Africa Act. The Union of South Africa is a unitary state, rather than a federation, with each colony's parliaments abolished and replaced with provincial councils. The Parliament consists of two parts: the Volksraad and Senate. The Volksraad members are elected mostly by the country's white minority, although the franchise varies depending upon the province. In the Cape and Natal, a qualified franchise based upon property and education requirements is in place, while the vote is white-only everywhere else. The Senate is appointed by an electoral college consisting of members of each of the five Provincial Councils and members of the Volksraad. Government follows the Westminster model, although with an elected President as head of state. South Africa continues to administer Bechuanaland, Basutoland and Swaziland as protectorates, and while considerable legislation is in place restricting the rights of the native population within the Union, it has not been fully implemented in these territories."
saf.2.a:0 "I see."

saf.3.t:0 "Black Monday hits South Africa"
saf.3.d:0 "A week ago, the German stock market collapsed, plunging the world into depression. South Africa has relied on trade with Germany and its sphere of influence since the British Revolution and the declaration of the South African Republic, and withdrawal from trade with the remaining members of the Entente.\n\nThe crisis has had a terrible effect upon the South African economy, unemployment has risen markedly as many companies that depended upon the German export market have gone out of business or laid off white workers in favour of cheaper native labour."
saf.3.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

saf.301.t:0 "A Plea to Ottawa"
saf.301.d:0 "With the Black Monday Crisis reaching our shores, it is clear to Jan Christiaan Smuts that South Africa will need help from abroad. Naturally, the first place for us to look is to our friends in the Entente: Canada, National France, and their allies around the world. Though these nations are struggling with their own crises as a result of the crash, we must make the argument that our continued survival is important for the existence of the alliance as a whole. After all, we serve as an important Southern base for the Entente, not to mention our significant wealth in diamonds and other resources. With that said, we must carefully choose who we ask for assistance. The British and Canadians will likely be more willing to hear us out, given our mutual ties, but the French are much closer, and share the common threat of Mittelafrika on our borders. It would be wisest to see what the Canadians can offer first, then reach out to the French and see what they can do to help us."
saf.301.a:0 "Our Canadian brothers will lend a hand!"

saf.302.t:0 "South Africa Begs for Assistance!"
saf.302.d:0 "The recent Black Monday Crisis has hit most of our alliance hard, but in South Africa, the economic turmoil appears to be threatening the continued stability of the current government, or at least what little stability there is. If we want to keep them in our alliance, it seems necessary to bail them out and at least help the battered nation back to it's feet so it can be a useful ally in our struggle against the Third Internationale and whoever else challenges our goal of returning to Europe. The question is perhaps less whether or not we should aid South Africa and more of how we should help them. What should we do?"
saf.302.a:0 "Restore our old trading arrangements!"
saf.302.b:0 "Give them loans directly and a bailout!"
saf.302.c:0 "Invest in their industrial sector!"

saf.4.t:0 "Dealing with the Crisis"
saf.4.d:0 "The global economic crisis has hit South Africa hard, leaving our economy in tatters and bringing our institutions to the brink of a full political crisis. Our dependence on trade with Germany, long-criticised by the pro-British Dominion Party, has seen deepening hardship take hold. However, the Volksraad is divided on how best to deal with the crisis.\n\nCheap native labour is seen by many as the chief cause of unemployment, and both the National Party and Labour Party are calling for further restrictions to be made on native employment. The National Party also believes an ambitious works programme and an exploitation of the Protectorates could alleviate the situation, while Labour feels socio-economic reform is key to solving the crisis.\n\nThe Dominion Party points again to the dependence on Germany and desires a resumption of trade ties with the Entente and the Empire, although large tracts of Afrikaner society would balk at the mere prospect of such a heel turn after two decades of independence."
saf.4.a:0 "The National Party will solve this crisis alone."
saf.4.b:0 "Work with our old coalition partners, Labour."
saf.4.c:0 "Co-operate with the Dominionists."

saf.5.t:0 "The National Party Splits"
saf.5.d.coalition_labour:0 "Unwilling to compromise their values, the more extreme wing of the National Party led by Daniel François Malan has broken away to form the 'Gesuiwerde' or Purified National Party. They reject the current government's compromise with socialists, and believe the best way to ensure the future of South Africa is to strengthen and expand the existing provincial segregation laws into a full nation-wide system termed 'apartheid'. They have already gained considerable support among the Afrikaner population, though it seems unlikely they will be a real factor in the coming election."
saf.5.d.coalition_dominion:0 "Unwilling to compromise their values, the more extreme wing of the National Party led by Daniel François Malan has broken away to form the 'Gesuiwerde' or Purified National Party. They utterly reject the current government's compromise with the British, and believe the best way to ensure the future of South Africa is to strengthen and expand the existing provincial segregation laws into a full nation-wide system termed 'apartheid'. They have already gained considerable support among the Afrikaner population, though it seems unlikely they will be a real factor in the coming election."
saf.5.d.reforms:0 "Unwilling to compromise their values, the more extreme wing of the National Party led by Daniel François Malan has broken away to form the 'Gesuiwerde' or Purified National Party. They utterly reject the current government's softening stance on issues of racial segregation, and believe the best way to ensure the future of South Africa is to strengthen and expand the existing provincial segregation laws into a full nation-wide system termed 'apartheid'. They have already gained considerable support among the Afrikaner population, though it seems unlikely they will be a real factor in the coming election."
saf.5.a:0 "Oh dear!"

saf.6.t:0 "Labour Coalition Dissolves"
saf.6.d:0 "The South African Labour Party had agreed to help the government deal with the current economic crisis - but, as part of that, they expected a certain degree of reforms to the country's racial segregation policies...reforms which, they say, simply haven't materialised. Thus the coalition has broken apart, and Labour leaders have declared an intention to see the National Party defeated in the upcoming election."
saf.6.a:0 "So much for that..."

saf.7.t:0 "Dominion Coalition Dissolves"
saf.7.d:0 "The Dominion Party had pledged to help the government deal with the current economic crisis - but, as part of that, they expected a number of radical reforms to the country's racial segregation policies...reforms which, they say, haven't materialised. Indeed, the government has ignored every recommendation of their Dominionist allies. Thus the coalition has broken apart, and Dominion leaders have renewed their intention to see the National Party defeated in the upcoming election."

saf.10.t:0 "The Representation of Natives Act"
saf.10.d.alone:0 "Originally planned before the current economic crisis, the Representation of Natives Act is meant to further solidify white political control in South Africa by repealing the acts in the Cape and Natal provinces which allow a small section of the native population to take part in elections. This would be done by taking natives out of the electoral rolls completely, reducing them to electing only five whites to the Senate through a system of block voting.\n\nHowever, in this new political climate the Gesuiwerde National Party are advising we use this opportunity to appease our core electoral support, the Afrikaners, by proscribing coloureds as well as natives from voting. A compromise has also been suggested: the establishment of a Native Representative Council, which would separate natives politically in addition to the act's amendments, yet leave coloured rights alone."
saf.10.d.dominion:0 "Originally planned before the current economic crisis, the Representation of Natives Act is meant to further solidify white political control in South Africa by repealing the acts in the Cape and Natal provinces which allow a small section of the native population to take part in elections. This would be done by taking natives out of the electoral rolls completely, reducing them to electing only five whites to the Senate through a system of block voting.\n\nDue to our coalition with the Dominionists, however, their Progressive wing have demanded we instead expand the number of allotted representatives in the Senate from five to ten and allow an equal number to sit in the Volksraad. Afrikaner nationalists in our party are vehemently against such moderating measures, however, and have instead suggested the establishment of a Native Representative Council, which would separate natives politically in addition to the act's amendments."
saf.10.a:0 "Agree to the Dominion Party's reform plan."
saf.10.b:0 "Pass the original text, as planned."
saf.10.c:0 "Establish the Native Representation Council as a compromise."
saf.10.e:0 "Establish the Native Representation Council."
saf.10.f:0 "Agree with the Gesuiwerde and bar coloureds from elections"

saf.11.t:0 "The Extent of Native Autonomy"
saf.11.d:0 "We have decided to grant autonomy to the local rulers of the former High Commission Territories, the new Paramount Chiefs of the respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basutoland amd the Swazi in Swaziland). But we need to clarify the extent of the Chiefs' power - is it limited to within the borders of the former HCT, or does it encompass all of their peoples throughout South Africa?"
saf.11.a:0 "Their authority stops at the border."
saf.11.b:0 "They will fully represent their people."

saf.15.t:0 "Détente with the South Africans?"
saf.15.d:0 "We have been contacted by the South African government which, due to the economic crisis gripping the former British colony, have requested a normalisation of relations with us in the hope of attracting financial capital from the Entente nations. How should we respond?"
saf.15.a:0 "Yes, we welcome trade with the South Africans..."
saf.15.b:0 "No! Traitors!"

saf.25.d:0 "Today in Port Elizabeth, the leading figures of the Dominion Party, General Jan C Smuts and Jan Hofmeyer, along with the provincial governors of the Cape, Natal and Rhodesia met to discuss the coming election in May. An agreement has been reached now that support for the Dominion Party and dissatisfaction with the ruling Nationalist govt has reached the point where the pro British faction could form the next administration. To that end, they have issued a deceleration, stating their intent to reform the Union of South Africa into a new more liberal Federation and to pursue a reconciliation with the British Empire."

saf.26.t:0 "The 1938 General Elections"
saf.26.d:0 "The 1938 Union of South Africa General Elections have clearly transformed into a referendum on the country's future. Either the Nationalists will retain control of the Volksraad and set about solidifying white, Afrikaner rule through a full system of Apartheid or they will be defeated by the Dominion Party who will move to fully enact the Port Elizabeth Declaration and the formation of a new, federal South Africa.\n\nIn what is likely to become the most important election in the nation's history, tensions are running high as reports of violent incidents throughout the country increase with each passing day."
saf.26.a:0 "The National Party Wins!"
saf.26.b:0 "The Dominion Party Wins!"

saf.27.t:0 "The Nationalist Government"
saf.27.d:0 "The National Party has fended off the challenge by Smuts's Dominionists. However, the election was dangerously close, with the Nationalists only having a razor-thin majority in the Volksraad. One of the more noticable features of the election was that all of the representatives for natives were Dominionists, and the Coloured vote was also overwhelmingly pro-British. Party hard-liners are saying we should move immediately to sever political ties between the races in South Africa once and for all by immediately implementing Apartheid. The atmosphere is dangerous, however, and thus others suggest waiting for two years, lest unrest turn towards violence."
saf.27.a:0 "We will not wait to implement Apartheid."
saf.27.b:0 "Perhaps waiting two years is for the best."

saf.28.t:0 "The Dominionist Government"
saf.28.d:0 "The Dominion Party has finally defeated the pro Afrikaner Nationalist Party and gained control of the Volksraad. The election was dangerously close, however, with the Dominionist majority being razor-thin. While gains were limited in Afrikaner-dominated areas, native and coloured voters have overwhelmingly endorsed our proposed federal model. Should we push ahead and immediately declare the end of the old Union and the start of the new South African Federation? Or should we wait a couple of years until the climate is less hostile, as any rash move now could be met with severe resistance."
saf.28.a:0 "No, we will not wait to create the Federation."
saf.28.b:0 "Perhaps waiting two years is for the best."

saf.29.d.split:0 "The time has come to formalise our system of racial segregation in South Africa, to finally split off the natives and coloured into their own political and social system separate from our own. This will restore an amount of unity to our nation, as artificially enforced as that may be. There is an expectation of future unrest even so, and thus there are elements of the party which suggest a more moderate version of apartheid than that planned...though others suggest that, if we go ahead with the original plan, Daniel François Malan and his Purified National Party may elect to forgive our earlier efforts at moderation and rejoin the government."

saf.30.t:0 "Gesuiwerde Rejoins the National Party"
saf.30.d:0 "Mollified by our full implementation of apartheid, Daniel François Malan and his fellow hard-liners have agreed to rejoin the government. Not everyone is thrilled by their return, though this does effectively make South Africa a one-party state, since the Afrikaner population is unlikely to support any other party in great numbers. Future elections will mostly be simply for show."
saf.30.a:0 "Good news, I think."

saf.31.t:0 "The National Party Splits"
saf.31.d:0 "Unwilling to compromise their values, the more extreme wing of the National Party led by Daniel François Malan has broken away to form the 'Gesuiwerde' or Purified National Party. They reject the current government's moderate approach towards the implementation of apartheid, and they have already gained considerable support among the Afrikaner population. It's entirely possible they could pose a threat in future elections."

saf.32.d:0 "The government of South Africa annouced recently that they wish to join our alliance. It's not a sudden move because pro-German policy is popular in many circles, including the government and the army. Do we want the South Africans to join us against our shared enemies?"

The states have their own legislatures and premiers with considerable powers over socio-economic policy within the state, but there are limits imposed by the central federal government based in Cape Town: the major ones are the Natives Trust Act and the Qualified Franchise Act, both of which have yet to be passed by the Volksraad. Needless to say, neither will be popular with the white Afrikaner population."
saf.35.a:0 "Long live the Federation!"

saf.36.t:0 "South Africa wishes to rejoin the Entente"
saf.36.d:0 "The government of the South African Federation has announced recently that they wish to return to the fold. It's not a sudden move, as pro-British policy is popular in many circles including the government and the army. This is a great day for the Empire, as we move forward together."

While a coronation is not possible at this time, [CAN_king_full_name] has been hailed as the monarch by all three houses of the South African Parliament. The former premier, Jan Smuts, looks set to be appointed as Governor-General, however we now have to decide how much power that position can exercise on the King's behalf. Many conservatives and liberals are advocating legally establishing the monarch as a figurehead, with his powers exercised by parliament, while nationalists are demanding Smuts, an Afrikaner, exercise the king's powers as Governor General."

saf.50.t:0 "Construction of the Voortrekker Monument"
saf.50.d:0 "Begun in 1935, the construction of the Voortrekker Monument is nearing completion. Situated in Pretoria, it commemorates the Voortrekkers who left the Cape Colony between 1835 and 1854 to found the Afrikaner Republics of the interior. Costs, however, continue to grow, but we are on schedule to open the Monument at the Centenary celebrations next year."

saf.51.t:0 "Preparations for the Centenary Celebrations"
saf.51.d:0 "The Centennial Anniversary of the Great Trek is little under a month away. The centenary celebrations are planned to commence with a re-enactment of the trek, beginning on 8 August 1938 with nine ox wagons departing from the the statue of Jan van Riebeeck in Cape Town and ending at the newly completed Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria, at which point the monument shall be inaugurated by the President.\n\nThe whole affair is meant to be a celebration of Afrikaner culture and heritage, but the situation in the country has since changed, and such a lavish event could very well be met with open hostility by the other racial groups and even the pro-British population who are likely to see it as a display of Afrikaner triumphalism. Shall we continue as planned or adopt a more modest approach?"

The ceremony was lacklustre, the poor funding self-evident. This was offset, however, by the large turnout of Afrikaners from other parts of South Africa, including a group calling themselves the Ossewabrandwag (Ox-Wagon Sentinels). Unfortunately this militia-of-sorts clashed with local police, who struggled to handle the larger than expected crowds. With violence escalting, the police tried to halt the procession and disperse the re-enactors, which resulted in shots being exchanged. Three policemen and 17 Ossewabrandwag were killed, and many more re-enactors and bystanders were injured."

It also formed a number of other unions amongst people of colour. While its founders were mainly drawn from the radical wing of the white working class, the movement would develop a substantial black African, Coloured and Indian membership.

The Immorality Amendment Act forbade 'unlawful racial intercourse' and 'any immoral or indecent act' between a white and a black, Indian or coloured person. Transport and civil facilities were segregated. Education was strictly segregated, with universities established for the sole use of Xhosa, Zulu, Sotho, Coloured, Indians etc. The cumulative effect of this was to stratify society solidly along racial lines."

saf.105.d:0 "Territorial separation was hardly a new institution in South Africa. There were, for example, the 'reserves' created under the British government in the nineteenth century. Under apartheid, the percentage of land reserved was increased from 8 to 13 percent to be used for black homelands, still a relatively small amount compared with the total population, and generally in economically unproductive areas of the country. These homelands or 'Bantustans' divided South Africa into a number of separate states, each of which is supposed to develop into a separate nation-state for the different ethnic groups. The practical effect of this legislation was to remove the citizenship of natives living within South Africa and reduce their status to that of migrant labour. The Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act abolished the remaining parliamentary representation for black people under the Representation of Natives Act, now represented by their own 'national' authorities."
saf.105.a:0 "OK."

saf.119.d:0 "For over a decade now, the old French colonies in the center of the African continent have been out of our control, having been stolen after the Weltkrieg. Now, we have a chance to bring them back into the fold. South Africa has offered to militarily intervene in the region to restore order and transfer control of these areas back to us once they are finished. As this would not require much effort on our part, it would be an easy offer to accept. On the other hand, some argue that we should remain focused on Europe, and not worry about minor colonies in the heart of Africa. What should we do?"
saf.119.a:0 "Accept the offer!"
saf.119.b:0 "We have bigger priorities!"

saf.179.t:0 "Chaos in South West Africa"
saf.179.d:0 "The gigantic German colony in central africa, stretching a continuous stretch of land from the Ivory Coast to Zanzibar, has collapsed in on itself. What was once the pride of the German nation has transformed in possibly the largest anarchy and violence the world has ever seen. South West Africa, or Deutsch-Südwestafrika is no exception to this rule, with white German settlers, bolstered by Afrikaners who moved into the region over the course of the 19th century, desperately attempting to suppress a native revolt against their rule.\n\nFact is that South West Africa has for a long time been a strategic goal for South Africa, and between 1915 and 1919 it was us who had been administering the territory. Calls are rising throughout South Africa that this is the time to undo ahistorical injustice: having had to turn South West Africa back over to the hun after we had won it with South African blood, because the war was lost in Europe. They call on the prime minister to send the Defence Force to South West Africa, put down the native revolt and integrate the colony into our nation. A telegraph message to Windhoek has been drafted, proposing that South Africa intervenes and suppresses the Namiblanders in return for their acceptance that South West Africa will, this time permanently, fall under the stewardship of South Africa."
saf.179.a:0 "Contact Windhoek, we shall assume their protection!"
saf.179.b:0 "South West Africa isn’t worth more South African blood…"

saf.180.t:0 "A message from Pretoria"
saf.180.d:0 "South Africa has had deep down had a desire to conquer South West Africa and had temporarily also completed this goal between 1915 and 1919. As such, they have been watching our situation with a keen eye and today a telegraph message from Pretoria has arrived in Windhuk. They express a willingness to intervene in our little problem with Namibland, but then we are to accept that the South African forces will never leave. It’s clear that they just want us to acquiesce in the fact that the German Mittelafrika dream has evaporated and that we will henceforth be South Africans. Some call this unacceptable, that we are German subjects and shall remain so. But others ask if it is truly worth risking the well-being of our people, the White Namibians, for this dream: support from the Vaterland might be months away and if we cannot hold back the Namiblanders, we may be exiled or worse by that native authority. Besides, South Africa may well intervene even if we reject their interference, the only difference will be that they will also be shooting at us..."
saf.180.a:0 "It is best for our people…"
saf.180.b:0 "We are subjects of the Kaiser and shall remain so!"

saf.181.t:0 "Südwestafrika acquiesces"
saf.181.d:0 "Good news, the authorities in Windhoek have recognized that a South African intervention is in their best interest and convey that they will welcome our army coming to their aid. The first units have already set foot in South West Africa for the first time since the humiliation in 1919. On the homefront, prominent nationalists are expressing their support for the Springboks coming to the aid of the beleaguered Afrikaners and their German brothers in South West Africa against the heathen foe while those aligned with general Smuts are speculating about the next step towards realising greater South Africa. The only opposition comes from the far left: the ISL, ICU and the smaller ANC, who declaim the action as ‘flagrant disrespect for the self-determination of Namibland people’."
saf.181.a:0 "Springboks to the rescue!"

saf.182.t:0 "Südwestafrika stands defiant"
saf.182.d:0 "Unfortunately, the authorities in Windhoek cling to the the objectively outdated idea of being imperial subjects of Germany, and vow to resist any attempts by South Africa to annex their home. While it is doubtful the rag-tag bunch of garrison leftovers would be able to resist us, intervening despite the lack of support from local whites would be seen as less legitimate by the world at large and may endanger our relations with the Germans. On the other hand, it is unlikely that this setback will change domestic public opinion on an intervention much, which is overwhelmingly in favour with both the right and the left."
saf.182.a:0 "We shall pacify these misguided huns as well!"
saf.182.b:0 "Our relationship with Berlin is too important!"

saf.183.t:0 "Safeguarding Portuguese East Africa?"
saf.183.d:0 "Disaster has struck the Portuguese: mainland Portugal has been overrun and their overseas empire is crumbling as opportunistic actors attempt to poach their possessions in both Africa and Asia. One of those possessions is right next on our border: Portuguese Mozambique. Its ports fulfill a vital export role for our industrial base in the Rand and most of it is commonly included in the concept of Greater South Africa. Possibly, the Germans might be plotting to take colony which would increase its leverage over us.\n\nHawks are urging us to act first by ordering our army to cross the Mozambican border, so as to ensure that South Africa’s interests are secured, and some of them are probably hoping we will annex the colony outright in the future. On the other hand, doves reject this course of action and point out that this would force South Africa to take international responsibility for the Mozambicans henceforth, and unnecessarily inflames tensions with the Germans and Portuguese."
saf.183.a:0 "Order the army to move for Lourenço Marques!"
saf.183.b:0 "More natives in South Africa? I think not!"
saf.183.c:0 "We cannot take the risk!"

saf.184.t:0 "South Africa moves into Mozambique"
saf.184.d:0 "The South African Defence Force has crossed the South African-Mozambican border into Mozambique. While it is ostensibly to protect the population and prevent a hostile takeover from a third power, it cannot be overlooked that South Africa has had ambitions to turn the Zambezi into its ‘natural border’ and it is highly doubtful they will be inclined to return it at a later point."
saf.184.a:0 "Never trust a protestant!"

saf.185.t:0 "South Africa moves into Mozambique"
saf.185.d:0 "The South African Defence Force has crossed the South African-Mozambican border into Mozambique. According to Pretoria it is with the goal to protect the local population and to prevent a so-called ‘third power’, which is almost certainly to mean us, from occupying the colony. The part of Mozambique north of the Zambezi river is much closer to our domains than to South Africa however, and if we move at once we can secure them before the South Africans, who, given their past rhetoric about a greater South Africa including Mozambique south of the Zambezi, are unlikely to bring things to a head over that."
saf.185.a:0 "Move in to take Northern Mozambique before the South Africans!"
saf.185.b:0 "Let’s not…"

saf.186.t:0 "The Germans occupy northern Mozambique"
saf.186.d:0 "Following our crossing of the border closely, the Germans have scrambled to secure the Northern part of Mozambique, which is the furthest away from our own country. Now the de-facto border splits Mozambique in half, following the Zambezi river. Their reaction has certainly legitimised our takeover. Had we not done this they would almost certainly have occupied all of Mozambique."
saf.186.a:0 "The Zambezi will have to do for a border."

saf.187.t:0 "Stellenbosch becomes monolingually Afrikaans"
saf.187.d:0 "The University of Stellenbosch, undeniably one of South Africa’s most prestigious institutions of higher education, based in Stellenbosch, has closed a process which had been going on for years. From this next academic year on forward the last two English and High Dutch (meaning the variety of the Netherlands) subjects will no longer be taught any longer. This means that from coming academic year forth, Stellenbosch will teach only in Afrikaans, rendering them the only monolingually Afrikaans university in the country. This event is a major milestone for the Afrikaans language movement, which had been propagated by dr. D.F. Malan since the beginning of this century."

Ever since the consolidation of power by the Liberal Party, the SAIRR's popularity has been growing swiftly, leading a lot of the MPs to the belief that the new coalition should openly announce its support for the organization. This would both help increase the cabinet's credibility and further improve relations between Africans and Europeans in our country. With the government's patronage, a new course for the SAIRR can be implemented, and it is decided that the association should focus on:"

To their opposition sits a group of Afrikaners and Nationalists, lead by Henrik Verwoerd, a prominent politician advocating for the implementetion of apartheid.
