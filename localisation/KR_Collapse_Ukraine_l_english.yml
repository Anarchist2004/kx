POLITICS_OSTAP_BENDER_DESC: "Ostap-Suleyman-Berta-Maria-Bender-Bey, also known as Bender-Zadunaysky or Ostap Ibragimovich Bender, is the Great Combinator of the Free City of Odesa, which he based on 400 relatively legal ways to make the population part with their money.\n\nOstap is a rather attractive young man with an interesting appearance. Despite his poverty and ignorance, Ostap is very smart, shrewd and savvy. He is charming, women of different ages like him. He has excellent acting skills, and is an excellent liar. He was unpretentious about food and lodgings, which was probably due to his youth. He gets drunk rarely, but \"aptly\".\n\nIn general, Ostap is a man who really wants to live, to try everything in this life, but there are too many obstacles in his way. That is why he is a caustic, sarcastic cynic, who seeks benefit for himself in everything. Ostap is very far-sighted and perceptive, he cannot deny his intuition. Perhaps, under different circumstances in life, he would have made an excellent career, earning good money, but he prefers to wander about the cities, living off scams and casual earnings, waiting for \"a platter with a blue plate\", on which chance will present him with a big score. This is his tragedy - a man with remarkable brains, intelligent, modern, drags out such, in general, miserable existence. He cannot sit in one place for long - he has too many plans and hopes."
