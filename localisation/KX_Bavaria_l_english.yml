####Focus Loc####
BAY_NATPOP_START:0 "Realm of South Germany"
BAY_NATPOP_START_desc:0 "We have finally brought the country some semblance of stability again-at least part of it. Now we must look to our future. As the united regions of South Germany, we stand in an advantageous position, but will it be enough to secure our position on the international stage?"

BAY_NATPOP_EMPOWER_MONARCHY:0 "Empower Ruprecht"
BAY_NATPOP_EMPOWER_MONARCHY_desc:0 "Ruprecht, of the house Wittelsbach, has offered hope for Germany. Under his steady hand, we would prosper as we did under the old Kaisers. However, to achieve the power he needs to do so, we must grant it to him. It is not a deicision we take lightly, but it is the right thing to do; we must empower Ruprecht."

BAY_NATPOP_CRACK_DOWN_ON_THE_LEFT:0 "Cracking down on Leftists"
BAY_NATPOP_CRACK_DOWN_ON_THE_LEFT_desc:0 "Syndicalism was a leading force in many of the recent disasters that have befallen Europe; first in Russia, then in France, and now in Germany itself. The leftist menace must be snuffed out, and if we fail, we may disappear from history entirely. For the German people, we must crack down on these extremists."

BAY_NATPOP_RALLY_THE_RIGHT:0 "Rallying the Right"
BAY_NATPOP_RALLY_THE_RIGHT_desc:0 "Germany was always a conservative nation, proud of its traditions and heritage. True Germans will rally around a leader who promises stability and security to their people, and we must rally all such people to our cause."

BAY_NATPOP_BAN_PARTIES:0 "Ban all Parties"
BAY_NATPOP_BAN_PARTIES_desc:0 "The very idea of political parties breeds instability in a nation. To restore order, we must eliminate the institution entirely. With these meddling cliques out of our way, we can move forward with the task of restoring our former might in Europe."

BAY_NATPOP_DEPLOY_PARAMILITARY:0 "Deploy Paramilitaries"
BAY_NATPOP_DEPLOY_PARAMILITARY_desc:0 "In the wake of the civil war, there are millions of veterans who suddenly find themselves out of work. To ameliorate this problem, we must bring these soldiers to bear in new paramilitaries. This will simultaneously solve our unemployment problems while also giving soldiers a purpose again..."

BAY_NATPOP_NEW_SOUTH_GERMANY:0 "A New South Germany"
BAY_NATPOP_NEW_SOUTH_GERMANY_desc:0 "We have worked tirelessly towards the achievement of this new state, and finally it has been realized. South Germany will be stronger than ever before, and for the first time in over a thousand years, the whole of the region will be unified and under its own control."

BAY_NATPOP_CORPORATE_MONARCHY:0 "A Corporate Monarchy"
BAY_NATPOP_CORPORATE_MONARCHY_desc:0 "The corporation is an essential entity for the survival of the government, but we need them as much as they need us. Only by working together can we hope to achieve anything close to the greatness the Kaisers once enjoyed. So, together we shall be, for the future of the German people!"

BAY_NATPOP_NEW_MILITARY_INDUSTRY:0 "New Military Industries"
BAY_NATPOP_NEW_MILITARY_INDUSTRY_desc:0 "Industry is the key to any powerful modern state, and though Bavaria has never had the industry of the Rhineland, we must change this out of necessity. To match the needs of our growing military, we shall have a growing industry to create the arms and armaments that Bavaria's brave soldiers so desperately need!"

BAY_NATPOP_GIVE_THE_POOR_TO_WORK:0 "Give Jobs to the Poor"
BAY_NATPOP_GIVE_THE_POOR_TO_WORK_desc:0 "In our new nation, there are still many problems that demand attention. One of the primary problems is that of unemployment, especially among the poor. We must give all Germans a chance, and in doing so, we can continue to recover from the devastation of past years."

BAY_NATPOP_BAVARIAN_RAILWAY:0 "Build New Railways"
BAY_NATPOP_BAVARIAN_RAILWAY_desc:0 "If we ever hope to contend with our neighbors, we must first modernize our infrastructure. Germany was once at the forefront of railway technology in Europe, and Bavaria must follow in those footsteps. Further, we can use this to help our economy grow in the midst of global economic crisis."

BAY_NATPOP_RAPID_REBUILDING:0 "Rapid Rebuilding"
BAY_NATPOP_RAPID_REBUILDING_desc:0 "There is no time to wallow in the destruction wraught upon Germany in past years; we must rebuild. If we fail to repair our broken nation, we will be vulnerable to outside invasion-and it will only get worse with time. Time is of the essence, and so we will rebuild southern Germany."

BAY_NATPOP_PRIORIZE_THE_MILITARY:0 "Military First Policy"
BAY_NATPOP_PRIORIZE_THE_MILITARY_desc:0 "The concerns of national security must triumph over all else in our fragile country. After all, there will be many who seek to swallow us up into their own nations, or impose foreign systems upon us. We must stand strong as Bavarians!"

BAY_NATPOP_FAMILY_SUBSIDES:0 "Family Subsidies"
BAY_NATPOP_FAMILY_SUBSIDES_desc:0 "The German family as a unit was fractured in the recent wars in our country, and we must restore this institution. Just as we have for thousands of years, we must once more honor this sacred organization. The only way we can do so is providing families with what they need in the wake of such horrible devastation."

BAY_NATPOP_OUR_FUTURE:0 "Our Future?"
BAY_NATPOP_OUR_FUTURE_desc:0 "Every great nation faces a choice at one point or another in its history. Now, our nation stands at a crossroads. If we take the safer route of creating some sort of South German state, we will find success but must decide what that means. However, we could also pursue older, more ambitious dreams..."

BAY_NATPOP_FRANKISH_AMBITION:0 "Frankish Ambition"
BAY_NATPOP_FRANKISH_AMBITION_desc:0 "To pursue a better future for our nation, we must look to the past, to a nation that set itself above all others in Europe. Francia was unparalleled in its ability to unify Western Europe, and it was in those times that Bavaria was born for the first time. We must aspire to be something more, as the Carolingians did; we must bring the old empire back together."

BAY_NATPOP_TAKE_SWITZERLAND:0 "Destroy Switzerland"
BAY_NATPOP_TAKE_SWITZERLAND_desc:0 "For too long, the Swiss have acted independently of the rest of Germany, denying their common heritage. Their claims to neutrality are apparently no longer as serious as they once were, given their recent actions in France. We should take advantage of this break in their historical tradition and bring them into the fold."

BAY_NATPOP_TAKE_AUSTRIA:0 "Crush the Habsburgs"
BAY_NATPOP_TAKE_AUSTRIA_desc:0 "The Habsburg family existed almost as far back as the Frankish Empire, and yet their legacy has been one of failure and misery for the German people in Austria. There was once a time when Bavaria and Austria were united, when their realm was a mere border state in our wider nation...we will restore this state of affairs."

BAY_NATPOP_RETAKE_GERMANY:0 "Retake our German Lands"
BAY_NATPOP_RETAKE_GERMANY_desc:0 "Over a thousand years ago, Germany was barely civilized, a land of villages and warring tribes. More recently, it was the strongest empire in the world, but only when it was united. We must restore this unity, but this time, it will be under our rule. Only Emperor Ruprecht can fulfill the promise of a united Germany once more."

BAY_NATPOP_END_THE_FRENCH_MENACE:0 "Ending the French Menace"
BAY_NATPOP_END_THE_FRENCH_MENACE_desc:0 "Like its namesake in the Frankish Empire, the French have been integral to the history of Europe. There would be no Francia without France, and as they were our brothers in history, they will be our brothers once more. The French people chafe under the rule of godless syndicalists; we must end these radicals and bring France home!"

BAY_NATPOP_TAKE_NORTH_ITALY:0 "Take Back Rome!"
BAY_NATPOP_TAKE_NORTH_ITALY_desc:0 "After the Lombards seized Italy from Byzantine rule, it became clear they were not worthy of holding the ancient land. Only the Franks could bring this land to its rightful glory, as it did when the region was under Frankish rule. We will restore this control and march all the way to the old city of Rome..."

BAY_NATPOP_ATTACK_BENELUX:0 "Absorb the Benelux"
BAY_NATPOP_ATTACK_BENELUX_desc:0 "The Dutch, Walloonians, Flemish, and Luxembourgians all have one thing in common. They have all decided to forget their common heritage, weakening themselves and their neighbors and leaving themselves open to foreign domination. After all, who could forget their eighty year war for independence against Spain? They may not realize their state is under threat, but we will help them realize that they would be better off with us."

BAY_NATPOP_FRANCONIAN_EMPIRE:0 "The Frankish Dream Realized"
BAY_NATPOP_FRANCONIAN_EMPIRE_desc:0 "Pursuing a dream thought to be dead for over a thousand years, Emperor Ruprecht has finally brought the Frankish Empire back to life. The founding nation of Europe has once again been restored to its former glory, and will live on for time immemorial. Our people will never be divided again!"

BAY_NATPOP_RETAKE_EURO_COLONIES:0 "Retaking our European Colonies"
BAY_NATPOP_RETAKE_EURO_COLONIES_desc:0 "In the reign of Charlemagne, the Franks colonized various border regions in Europe. They pushed into Spain, beat back the Magyars, and routed the Slavs. Now, we must re-establish this policy of border regions. These regions will serve as important buffer states and make our realm all the more stronger."

BAY_NATPOP_RETAKE_ASIAN_COLONIES:0 "Retaking the Asian Colonies"
BAY_NATPOP_RETAKE_ASIAN_COLONIES_desc:0 "Only a few short years ago, Germany had the mightiest empire in history. Now, the ungrateful wretches in our old Asian colonies fancy themselves as independent. If we are to carry on where our predecessors left off, we must bring these wealthy regions back into our hands!"

BAY_NATPOP_RETAKE_AFRICAN_COLONIES:0 "Restore our Place in Afrika"
BAY_NATPOP_RETAKE_AFRICAN_COLONIES_desc:0 "It is in the Dark Continent that the fate of Germany will be decided. If we are able to reimpose order there, we can count on their vast resources once more. Once we do that, there will be few limits to what we can achieve."

BAY_NATPOP_SOUTH_GERMAN_AMBITION:0 "Dreams of a True South Germany"
BAY_NATPOP_SOUTH_GERMAN_AMBITION_desc:0 "Though some in our nation dream of an independent Bavaria, others have much larger ambitions. The notion of unifying all South Germans has gained momentum recently, and it wouldn't be out of question. After all, by bringing all the South Germans into one nation, we would match the might of the old North German Federation, and perhaps we could match their accomplishments as well."

BAY_NATPOP_SOUTH_TAKE_AUSTRIA:0 "Restore German Rule to Austria"
BAY_NATPOP_SOUTH_TAKE_AUSTRIA_desc:0 "Austria is fundamentally German. In fact, in the times of the Carolingians, we were united with them in one realm. We must restore that state of affairs and once more bring Austria home to its brothers."

BAY_NATPOP_SOUTH_TAKE_SWITZERLAND:0 "End the Swiss"
BAY_NATPOP_SOUTH_TAKE_SWITZERLAND_desc:0 "The renegade Swiss have troubled Europe with their 'neutrality' for too long. We know they are no longer neutral, and we must take advantage of that state of affairs. By bringing these true Germans into the fold, we will be one step closer to a true southern Germany."

BAY_NATPOP_THE_SOUTH_GERMAN_KINGDOM:0 "The South German Kingdom"
BAY_NATPOP_THE_SOUTH_GERMAN_KINGDOM_desc:0 "We have done the impossible; we have brought all South Germans under our control, a feat the German Empire could never accomplish. Now, we look to a future of prosperity, to a future as South Germany!"

BAY_NATPOP_AUSTRIAN_FUTURE:0 "Austrian Future"
BAY_NATPOP_AUSTRIAN_FUTURE_desc:0 "Our future necessarily lies in Austria; after all, we are brothers in blood and history. Though we will likely refuse any offer that would place Vienna in charge of our country, they are certainly welcome to join us..."

BAY_NATPOP_JOIN_THE_AUSTRIAN_ALLIANCE:0 "Joining the Austrian Alliance"
BAY_NATPOP_JOIN_THE_AUSTRIAN_ALLIANCE_desc:0 "The next best option beyond annexation is a close partnership with our brothers in the east. An alliance with the Austrians could help us achieve the greatness we lost in our civil war."

BAY_NATPOP_JOIN_AUSTRIA:0 "Formal Integration"
BAY_NATPOP_JOIN_AUSTRIA_desc:0 "An alliance is not enough; we must be united in one nation once more. With Austria united with its brothers in Germany, we will create a state superior to all the other successor states in the old German Empire."

BAY_NATPOP_AUSTRIAN_INVESTORS:0 "Invite Austrian Investors"
BAY_NATPOP_AUSTRIAN_INVESTORS_desc:0 "Though Austrian industry was often in the shadow of Germany's might, we could certainly benefit from their help now. By encouraging investment from Vienna and other sectors, we can build up our economy once more and salvage what is left from the civil war."

BAY_NATPOP_AUSTRIAN_OFFICERS:0 "Invite Austrian Officers"
BAY_NATPOP_AUSTRIAN_OFFICERS_desc:0 "Austria's army is maligned, perhaps unjustly, for its performance in World War I. The reality is that Austrian officers were highly talented; it was non-Germans that held their military back. We should bring this talent into the fold to gain an advantage over our neighbors, and if we succeed, our potential will grow dramatically."

BAY_NATPOP_UNITE_GERMANY:0 "Unite Germany under our Rule"
BAY_NATPOP_UNITE_GERMANY_desc:0 "After a mere few years of division, it is already clear that our neighbors seek to feast off the carcass that is Germany. If anyone is going to protect the German people, it will be us. We must bring them all under our control, just as they were under the Kaiser, if we hope to maintain German sovereignty and freedom."

BAY_NATPOP_RECLAIM_FORMER_IMPERIAL_LANDS:0 "Reclaim the Former Imperial Lands"
BAY_NATPOP_RECLAIM_FORMER_IMPERIAL_LANDS_desc:0 "The German Empire was the most splendid nation on the face of the Earth once, but it could only be that way with the addition of its empire. It is crucial that these colonies be brought back under our control, and we will work towards this goal to restore the old superpower we once lived in."
