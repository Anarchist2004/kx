### Focuses ###

KIV_aftermath_of_the_mutiny:0 "The Trinité Coloniale Collapses"
KIV_aftermath_of_the_mutiny_desc:0 "The ‘Trinité Coloniale’ were the three key tenets of Flandro-Wallonian rule over the Congo, outlining a necessary emphasis on advancing the interests of the state, church, and private companies that all vied for a piece of our rightful land. With their greed and ambition consuming them, the Mittelafrikan monstrosity has collapsed and with it, so too has the Vrijstaat and this unholy trinity. We now stand free of the vile ‘politique indigène’ that oppressed our people for centuries, but we are not safe yet. To arms, true sons of Kivu and the Congo, for we finally march to slay the colonial beast once and for all!"

KIV_enemies_on_all_fronts:0 "Our Backs To The Wall"
KIV_enemies_on_all_fronts:0 "The Congo has devolved into a blood and lead-filled maelstrom, and we are beset upon from all sides by Africans and Imperialists alike. Surrounding our mercurial borders lies the burning remains of the Vrijstaat, with the mercenaries and the Force Publique rising to the West as the newly-independent and ever-extravagant Union Minière takes hold off Katanga to the south. We have nowhere to fall back to, and no allies to call for. It is us against all of Congo, for this war for the Dark Heart of Africa."

KIV_advance_on_leopoldville:0 "Retake the Gem"
KIV_advance_on_leopoldville_desc:0 "Kinshasa, or Leopoldville as the imperialists call it, is the gem of our country. A metropolis by Central African standards, the city is both a vital economic center and rail hub. More importantly, its control over the Matadi-Leopoldville Railway is vital for our forces to control, for it serves as the only route of easy access to the Port of Matadi - the only major seaport in the Congo. We must retake the city at all costs!"

KIV_push_back_buganda:0 "Burn the Exploitative Hives"
KIV_push_back_buganda_desc:0 "On the fringes of the Congo, the opportunistic mercenaries lead by [KSV.getleader] and the greedy Union Minière of Katanga exploit our people and our lands, all in the pursuit of capitalist gain or self-centered ambitions. They crawl and chitter across our paradise like mites and maggots seeking to gnaw away at our resource-rich and bountiful birthright. We shall burn these insects where they stand, for no one shall exploit this Eden besides us!"

KIV_we_have_numbers_on_our_side:0 "The Native Wave"
KIV_we_have_numbers_on_our_side_desc:0 "What we lack in equipment and supplies, we more than make up for in sheer numbers. After decades upon decades of colonial rule, the presence of the White Man still pales in comparison to our might, for as hard as they tried, they could never replace us. We are a varied people numbering millions strong; we shall crash down upon these lost imperialists and suffocate them under our endless marching masses."

KIV_rally_the_congo_askari:0 "Rally the Congolese Askari"
KIV_rally_the_congo_askari_desc:0 "The small numbers of organized troops we have at our disposal are all members of the Askari or Force Publique - African soldiers who have long chafed under colonial rule but for their service have received training and arms beyond anything else currently in our employ. We must rally these elite veterans to serve as the vanguard for our uprising. The Congo will rise and the Askari shall lead us there!"

KIV_the_jungle_is_our_friend:0 "Masters of this Primordial Jungle"
KIV_the_jungle_is_our_friend_desc:0 "The jungles and thickets of the Congo are some of the oldest and densest on Earth, and no one knows these lands quite like we do. Drawing upon the vast wealth of knowledge the many native Bantu peoples have of these virgin wilds and incorporating this into our tactics as codified doctrine will allow us to teach these tips and tricks of jungle warfare to new recruits for generations to come. We are one with the jungle, and we shall use this fact to rein hellfire down upon our foes as they struggle to cross the mires and pitfalls of this primordial eden."

KIV_kivu_prevails:0 "The Final Push For Freedom"
KIV_kivu_prevails_desc:0 "The Askari and native kingdoms and tribes have been rallied and roused while our forces pour into the Congo’s various thickets and estuaries, cutting down mercenaries and settlers alike in their quest to rid the Congo of the Imperialist’s taint once and for all. The final moment is upon us, for it is now or never. We shall either die a fiery and glorious death in the service of our people or we shall finally stand free and victorious over a sovereign Congo. Destiny awaits us in the final battle, so let us charge and meet fate head on!"

KIV_future_of_the_congo:0 "Telama Besi Kongo!"
KIV_future_of_the_congo_desc:0 "Arise, my fellow Congolese and stand with me. We have thrown off the shackles of Imperialist oppression and have given birth to a sovereign and free nation here in the Congo. Not since the Teke Kingdom and the Federation of the Bakuba has the Congo seen a free, native-led state free from foreign meddling and greed. Our land is smoldering and our people carry on battered and scarred, but we have triumphed. Congo is free at last!"
