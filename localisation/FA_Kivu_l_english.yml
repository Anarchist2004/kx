### Focuses ###

KIV_aftermath_of_the_mutiny:0 "The Trinité Coloniale Collapses"
KIV_aftermath_of_the_mutiny_desc:0 "The ‘Trinité Coloniale’ were the three key tenets of Flandro-Wallonian rule over the Congo, outlining a necessary emphasis on advancing the interests of the state, church, and private companies that all vied for a piece of our rightful land. With their greed and ambition consuming them, the Mittelafrikan monstrosity has collapsed and with it, so too has the Vrijstaat and this unholy trinity. We now stand free of the vile ‘politique indigène’ that oppressed our people for centuries, but we are not safe yet. To arms, true sons of Kivu and the Congo, for we finally march to slay the colonial beast once and for all!"

KIV_enemies_on_all_fronts:0 "Our Backs To The Wall"
KIV_enemies_on_all_fronts:0 "The Congo has devolved into a blood and lead-filled maelstrom, and we are beset upon from all sides by Africans and Imperialists alike. Surrounding our mercurial borders lies the burning remains of the Vrijstaat, with the mercenaries and the Force Publique rising to the West as the newly-independent and ever-extravagant Union Minière takes hold off Katanga to the south. We have nowhere to fall back to, and no allies to call for. It is us against all of Congo, for this war for the Dark Heart of Africa."

KIV_advance_on_leopoldville:0 "Retake the Gem"
KIV_advance_on_leopoldville_desc:0 "Kinshasa, or Leopoldville as the imperialists call it, is the gem of our country. A metropolis by Central African standards, the city is both a vital economic center and rail hub. More importantly, its control over the Matadi-Leopoldville Railway is vital for our forces to control, for it serves as the only route of easy access to the Port of Matadi - the only major seaport in the Congo. We must retake the city at all costs!"

KIV_push_back_buganda:0 "Burn the Exploitative Hives"
KIV_push_back_buganda_desc:0 "On the fringes of the Congo, the opportunistic mercenaries lead by [KSV.getleader] and the greedy Union Minière of Katanga exploit our people and our lands, all in the pursuit of capitalist gain or self-centered ambitions. They crawl and chitter across our paradise like mites and maggots seeking to gnaw away at our resource-rich and bountiful birthright. We shall burn these insects where they stand, for no one shall exploit this Eden besides us!"

KIV_we_have_numbers_on_our_side:0 "The Native Wave"
KIV_we_have_numbers_on_our_side_desc:0 "What we lack in equipment and supplies, we more than make up for in sheer numbers. After decades upon decades of colonial rule, the presence of the White Man still pales in comparison to our might, for as hard as they tried, they could never replace us. We are a varied people numbering millions strong; we shall crash down upon these lost imperialists and suffocate them under our endless marching masses."

KIV_rally_the_congo_askari:0 "Rally the Congolese Askari"
KIV_rally_the_congo_askari_desc:0 "The small numbers of organized troops we have at our disposal are all members of the Askari or Force Publique - African soldiers who have long chafed under colonial rule but for their service have received training and arms beyond anything else currently in our employ. We must rally these elite veterans to serve as the vanguard for our uprising. The Congo will rise and the Askari shall lead us there!"

KIV_the_jungle_is_our_friend:0 "Masters of this Primordial Jungle"
KIV_the_jungle_is_our_friend_desc:0 "The jungles and thickets of the Congo are some of the oldest and densest on Earth, and no one knows these lands quite like we do. Drawing upon the vast wealth of knowledge the many native Bantu peoples have of these virgin wilds and incorporating this into our tactics as codified doctrine will allow us to teach these tips and tricks of jungle warfare to new recruits for generations to come. We are one with the jungle, and we shall use this fact to rein hellfire down upon our foes as they struggle to cross the mires and pitfalls of this primordial eden."

KIV_kivu_prevails:0 "The Final Push For Freedom"
KIV_kivu_prevails_desc:0 "The Askari and native kingdoms and tribes have been rallied and roused while our forces pour into the Congo’s various thickets and estuaries, cutting down mercenaries and settlers alike in their quest to rid the Congo of the Imperialist’s taint once and for all. The final moment is upon us, for it is now or never. We shall either die a fiery and glorious death in the service of our people or we shall finally stand free and victorious over a sovereign Congo. Destiny awaits us in the final battle, so let us charge and meet fate head on!"

KIV_future_of_the_congo:0 "Telama Besi Kongo!"
KIV_future_of_the_congo_desc:0 "Arise, my fellow Congolese and stand with me. We have thrown off the shackles of Imperialist oppression and have given birth to a sovereign and free nation here in the Congo. Not since the Teke Kingdom and the Federation of the Bakuba has the Congo seen a free, native-led state free from foreign meddling and greed. Our land is smoldering and our people carry on battered and scarred, but we have triumphed. Congo is free at last!"

KIV_the_age_old_question:0 "A Dance of Évolués and Askari"
KIV_the_age_old_question_desc:0 "With our independence secured, the Congolese people now stand at a crossroads. The ‘General’ Louis de Gonzague Bobozo has led the newly-birthed Armée Nationale Congolaise from the ruins of the old White-led Askari command structure, and with his military’s efficacy, this young but charismatic soldier has ruled as the de-facto rules of this so-called ‘Kivu Clique’. However, the cries of a newborn democratic movement gnaw away at the stability of the nation each day, as nationalist and socialist elements bubble and foment under our society’s surface. The Congo one again sits on the edge of drastic change."

KIV_gonzauges_guidance:0 "The Young General"
KIV_gonzauges_guidance_desc:0 "Louis de Gonzague Bobozo, or General Gonzague as he has become known, has decided to shrug off the growing calls for democracy and instead continue to establish this young Congolese state under the wise and measured guidance of military rule. The native Black officers of the Askari and the Armée Nationale Congolaise shall fill out the hierarchy as Gonzague endeavors to build the first stable native-ruled nation in post-collapse Middle Africa."

KIV_nod_from_kemalism:0 "A Nod From Kemalism"
KIV_nod_from_kemalism_desc:0 "Far past the jungles of the Congo and the sands of the Sahara lies the lands of the Ottoman Empire. Recently, one of their largest political figures has begun making waves with his attempts to transform the multi-ethnic, multi-religious empire into a secular, unitary, and modern state; a situation similar to the one we find ourselves in. The young General Gonzague has been enamored by Kemal’s writings, and seeks to implement some of his ideas into our fledgling state."

KIV_assert_askari_dominance:0 "Assert Askari Dominance"
KIV_assert_askari_dominance_desc:0 "Our war for independence may have been fought with the masses of tribal and village conscripts requisitioned from the many kingdoms and ethnic groups within the Congo, the war was won by the Askari. Their dominance and skill is unmatched in the region, and they shall be given sweeping benefits and powers to thank them for their service, for the Congolese owe these men their lives and freedom, and they will be rewarded for it."

KIV_set_up_the_officer_committee:0 "Set Up the Officer Committee"
KIV_set_up_the_officer_committee_desc:0 "An oversight committee of loyal Askari officers and strategists shall be established in order to serve as the main bureaucracy of our state. This thinktank of stern, stalwart military minds shall lead the Congo as they endeavor to usher in a newfound era of stability and unity. Our administration shall be free from corruption and greed as the principles of stratocracy and our soldiers’ fine training and sense of duty guide our way into the future."

KIV_arrest_the_corrupt:0 "The Cancer of Corruption"
KIV_arrest_the_corrupt_desc:0 "Corruption is a cancer that has long infected Congolese administrations from the rule of King Leopold to the fall of the Vrijstaat, ever spreading like a cancerous mass seeking to swallow any notion of good governance in Congo before it can even begin. We must cut away and remove any and all sources of corruption and decay using whatever means the Young General and his forces deem necessary. Congo will be cleansed of this plague once and for all."

KIV_expel_the_colonials:0 "Excise the Imperialist Parasite"
KIV_expel_the_colonials_desc:0 "The colonists, settlers, military officers, and imperialist capitalists of the Western Powers have long been a plague upon the Congo. Since the time of the first Portuguese expeditions that revealed our lands to these dogs to the horrific and shameful acts committed against freedom and sovereignty during the Scramble for Africa, our people have just been mere playthings or obstacles to the imperialists’ greed. This ends, finally, for General Gonzague and his loyal forces in the ANC shall remove the ones smart enough to leave peacefully, and eradicate those naive or foolish enough to resist. Congo is for the Congolese!"

KIV_formalize_the_military_government:0 "Formalize Askari Rule"
KIV_formalize_the_military_government_desc:0 "The Askari, and the wider ANC at large, have steadily seen an increase to their powers and prominence within Congolese society since the rise of the Young General Gonzague. With these veterans and soldiers already practically running every facet of our government already, it is time to make this official. Aside from just the bureaucracy as before, the entire political and governmental apparatus of the Congo shall be organized across military lines. We shall all be equal under the ever-watchful eye of the Armée Nationale Congolaise."

KIV_embrace_pan_africanism:0 "Whispers of the Pan-African Dream"
KIV_embrace_pan_africanism_desc:0 "The Young General has increasingly been inspired with the influential works of numerous Pan-African thinkers, whispering in his ear like an unignorable siren. From Duvalier in Haiti and Garvey in America to the titans of Africa like Padmore, Nkrumah, Obama, and Kenyatta, General Gonzague has pulled from many sources to begin to formulate his own unique blend of Pan-African thought. Denying the traditional Left-Right split that has plagued the movement for decades, Gonzague now seeks to pursue his own path, free of the influence of the ANC’s old guard as he begins to dream of a one, united Africa."

KIV_all_hail_zaire:0 "Tu Besi Nzere!"
KIV_all_hail_zaire_desc:0 "The place one known as ‘the Congo’ is dead, for Nzere is the one, true ‘Congo’ state. We have been proven victorious over our foes time and time again; the might and supremacy of the African people is a fact now laid into stone in blood. Gonzague has burned away the vestiges of the old Vrijstaat and, like a phoenix rebirthed from ash, our people and our nation have been reborn as true, free Africans. Arise, Nzerians! Your birthright has been reclaimed!"

KIV_free_from_colonial_shakles:0 "Retour à l’Authenticité"
KIV_free_from_colonial_shakles_desc:0 "The newly christened Gonzague Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga has decreed a ‘return to authenticity’ to wash over all of the Congo. Seeking to eliminate any and all traces of colonial influence, Gonzague has decreed that things like western religions, dress, naming conventions, pronoun usage, and more are all dated and tainted vestiges of an imperialist-dominated past. All of these sins and more shall be washed away in this process of ‘Nzerianisation’, for the Congo is for Africans, and no one else!"

KIV_new_identity:0 "The First True Africans"
KIV_new_identity_desc:0 "Nzere now stands resolute and strong, dashing towards an enlightened and sovereign future under the wise rule of Gonzague Sese Seko, it's all powerful warrior and champion of Nzerian independence. No nation on this chaotic and disgraced continent has burned away the shackles and chains of colonialism as totally and completely as we have, and now we stand as the first truly African nation in centuries, all thanks to our sole and rightful leader. All hail Nzere, all hail Gonzague, for Gonzague is Nzere."

KIV_young_officer_stratocracy:0 "Young Officer Stratocracy"
KIV_young_officer_stratocracy_desc:0 "With our military government firmly established, it is time we begin to evolve this air of martial rule to its natural conclusion. Politicians and ministers shall be a thing of the past, for only our own officers are trusted enough to represent the people in any meaningful capacity. The best among them shall rise to the top to lead our people while those officers unfit to lead our nation shall instead lead our troops into battle, following better men along the way. The Young General and his compatriots are all Congo needs to survive."

KIV_state_for_the_military:0 "A True Askari State"
KIV_state_for_the_military_desc:0 "Any illusion of civilian rule has been obliterated, and the Congo now lies firmly within the grasp of the Askari of the Armée Nationale Congolaise. Under the Young General and his clique of eager, voracious officers and generals, the Congo has been transformed into one of the most militarized places on Earth. All citizens upon reaching a certain age are conscripted into the military for life, filling out the various duties and tasks any state and army requires to function, all under the jurisdiction and command of General Gonzague and an oppressive atmosphere of martial law. The Congo is its army, and its army is Congo!"

KIV_intergrate_the_guerillas:0 "Everything for the ANC"
KIV_intergrate_the_guerillas_desc:0 "Everything in Congo belongs to the State, and since the Armée Nationale Congolaise is the State, everything in Congo inturn belongs to them. Under the Young General Gonzague, everything from the smallest piece of timber cut from our famous hardwoods to the largest vein of uranium ore from Shinkolobwe belongs to the ANC. Every man, woman, and child serves their role in the military stratocracy, and everyone has their set purpose. This cohesive unit toils endlessly for the ANC, wholly dedicated to the fierce protectors of Congo. There is no Congo without the ANC."
