### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_LOUIS_BOBOZO_DESC:0 "The last thing young Gonzague imagined in his career as a German Askari is to be leading one of the biggest states in the now-free Africa. Born in the later years of the Belgian Congo and then Mittelafrika - he was enthralled by the discipline and exploits of the Askari. He signed up in 1933 and quickly rose through the ranks through his great leadership skills after squashing several revolts and guerrilla groups on behalf of his Hunnic masters. However his true loyalty was always with his people. When the Governor of the Congo ordered his division to pacify Kivu and his home state of the northwest with senselessly brutality, he decided to stand up for his people by organizing a mutiny. Despite his really young age, he rallied most of the Congo's African-majority armies under his banner and overthrew their German masters. Now young Gonzague stands at a crossroads - his fledgling clique is surrounded on all sides by enemies, and his government is rife with incompetence due to his lack of political experience from his young age. Will the Kivu Clique lead the Congo to it's deserved glory, or will it fall to the other warlords and tribes vying for the same level of power?"

### Ideas ###

KIV_native_support:0 "Support from the Congolese"
KIV_native_support_desc:0 "Both the urban sprawls and primordial wilds of the Congo are home to millions of people, many of whom revile the colonial system as much as we do. Though they may not throw in with us politically, or in any official capacity, these masses are still allies to the cause and true Congolese patriots. Their aid, whether in the form of guerilla attacks or simple donations of weapons or supplies, goes a long way in helping the war effort."

KIV_inexperience:0 "Inexperienced in Statecraft"
KIV_inexperience_desc:0 "We are a newly birthed nation in an ever expanding sea of chaos and war. Our forces and infantile government have no experience when it comes to running a state, and as such, the process of laying our initial national foundations has been a painful and slow process. We must adapt quickly to this new situation, lest our independence be lost before it has even been truly earned."

KIV_inexperience2:0 "Inexperience in Statecraft"
KIV_inexperience2_desc:0 "We are a newly birthed nation in an ever expanding sea of chaos and war. Our forces and infantile government have no experience when it comes to running a state, and as such, the process of laying our initial national foundations has been a painful and slow process. We must adapt quickly to this new situation, lest our independence be lost before it has even been truly earned."

KIV_push_idea:0 "Final Push"
KIV_push_idea_desc:0 "The Askari and native kingdoms and tribes have been rallied and roused while our forces pour into the Congo’s various thickets and estuaries, cutting down mercenaries and settlers alike in their quest to rid the Congo of the Imperialist’s taint once and for all. The final moment is upon us, for it is now or never. We shall either die a fiery and glorious death in the service of our people or we shall finally stand free and victorious over a sovereign Congo. Destiny awaits us in the final battle, so let us charge and meet fate head on!"

KIV_masters_of_the_jungle_idea:0 "Masters of the Jungle"
KIV_masters_of_the_jungle_idea_desc:0 "The jungles and thickets of the Congo are some of the oldest and densest on Earth, and no one knows these lands quite like we do. Drawing upon the vast wealth of knowledge the many native Bantu peoples have of these virgin wilds and incorporating this into our tactics as codified doctrine will allow us to teach these tips and tricks of jungle warfare to new recruits for generations to come. We are one with the jungle, and we shall use this fact to rein hellfire down upon our foes as they struggle to cross the mires and pitfalls of this primordial eden."

KIV_aksari_dominance:0 "Askari Dominance"
KIV_aksari_dominance_desc:0 "Our war for independence may have been fought with the masses of tribal and village conscripts requisitioned from the many kingdoms and ethnic groups within the Congo, the war was won by the Askari. Their dominance and skill is unmatched in the region, and they shall be given sweeping benefits and powers to thank them for their service, for the Congolese owe these men their lives and freedom, and they will be rewarded for it."

KIV_officer_rule:0 "Rule of the Officer Committee"
KIV_officer_rule_desc:0 "An oversight committee of loyal Askari officers and strategists shall be established in order to serve as the main bureaucracy of our state. This thinktank of stern, stalwart military minds shall lead the Congo as they endeavor to usher in a newfound era of stability and unity. Our administration shall be free from corruption and greed as the principles of stratocracy and our soldiers’ fine training and sense of duty guide our way into the future."

KIV_officer_rule2:0 "Rule of the Officer Committee"
KIV_officer_rule2_desc:0 "An oversight committee of loyal Askari officers and strategists shall be established in order to serve as the main bureaucracy of our state. This thinktank of stern, stalwart military minds shall lead the Congo as they endeavor to usher in a newfound era of stability and unity. Our administration shall be free from corruption and greed as the principles of stratocracy and our soldiers’ fine training and sense of duty guide our way into the future."

KIV_no_corruption:0 "Purge of the Corrupt"
KIV_no_corruption_desc:0 "Corruption is a cancer that has long infected Congolese administrations from the rule of King Leopold to the fall of the Vrijstaat, ever spreading like a cancerous mass seeking to swallow any notion of good governance in Congo before it can even begin. We must cut away and remove any and all sources of corruption and decay using whatever means the Young General and his forces deem necessary. Congo will be cleansed of this plague once and for all."

KIV_colonial_purge:0 "Authenticité Program"
KIV_colonial_purge_desc:0 "The newly christened Gonzague Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga has decreed a ‘return to authenticity’ to wash over all of the Congo. Seeking to eliminate any and all traces of colonial influence, Gonzague has decreed that things like western religions, dress, naming conventions, pronoun usage, and more are all dated and tainted vestiges of an imperialist-dominated past. All of these sins and more shall be washed away in this process of ‘Nzerianisation’, for the Congo is for Africans, and no one else!"

KIV_retirement_fund:0 "Askari Retirement Fund"
KIV_retirement_fund_desc:0 "It was on the backs and with the blood of the Askari that Congo’s independence was won. Without these veterans, our shining republic would have been but a mere distant dream in the minds of servants, slaves, and deadmen. Despite many of them serving under the regime of the imperialists before the Collapse, these men have proven that they are true sons of the Congo. Pensions, housing-assistance, jobs, and more will be provided to these heroes, and the people they saved shall pay for it."

KIV_solid_government:0 "Stable Bureaucracy"
KIV_solid_government_desc:0 "Our new republic needs a strong bureaucracy if our government is to adequately meet the needs of the Congolese people in an efficient and orderly fashion. Long dead must be the days of chaos and misinformation that once infested every inch of our Congo under the Vrijstaat."

KIV_ethnic_federalism2:0 "A Federation of Ethnic Equals..."
KIV_ethnic_federalism2_desc:0 "The new Congolese republic must embrace its unique constituent identities and ethnicities and not hide behind the facade of a central and unified ‘nationality.’ Sure we all live in the Congo, but we are not all just Congolese; we are Zande, Songye, Luba, Kundu, Mbole, Hamba, Komo, Ngata, and so many more. Together, but unique, shall be the way forward for the Congo and all its people..."

KIV_regionalism:0 "Western Investment"
KIV_regionalism_desc:0 "The unique identities that have formed in the various regions of the Congo from the unique local mixture of ethnicities and tribes is truly one-of-a-kind on this planet. We should embrace this regional identity and set up regional administration to govern each cohesive regional unit, for the leading party already does with their beloved Katanga."

KIV_private_investment:0 "Privatization of Colonial-Era Companies"
KIV_private_investment_desc:0 "The Tshombe regime has decided to privatize all former colonial companies within the Congo’s borders, bursting open the floodgates for thousands of our people to jump at the chance to own their own business and companies. Though most will be bought up by the small minority of established, wealthy Évolués, the mere opportunity being available has been enough to stimulate our economy. Our profit margins soar ever higher as we build a true entrepreneurial class for our republic."

KIV_national_investment:0 "Nationalization of Colonial-Era Companies"
KIV_national_investment_desc:0 "The Tshombe regime has decided to nationalize all former colonial companies within the Congo’s borders, massively inflating the resources at the government’s disposal and the responsibilities they must now be accountable for. President Tshombe himself is delighted, able to siphon off as much money from this ever-growing pot as he pleases as he uses the rest to drag the Congo into a modern and westernized future."

KIV_western_investment:0 "Western Investment"
KIV_western_investment_desc:0 "The Union Minière du Haut-Katanga is the largest company in the Congo, accounting for nearly 70% of our national economy. Any party willing to get anything done in this nation has to go through them, but Tshombe has long held friendly ties and business relations with this industrial conglomerate. By allowing the Union Minière free reign within our economy, the Congo as a whole and Tshombe himself will be rewarded handsomely as the economy is revolutionized, westernized, and modernized on a national scale. However, much of the profits will still be going into the pockets of these former imperialists."

### Focuses ###

KIV_aftermath_of_the_mutiny:0 "The Trinité Coloniale Collapses"
KIV_aftermath_of_the_mutiny_desc:0 "The ‘Trinité Coloniale’ were the three key tenets of Flandro-Wallonian rule over the Congo, outlining a necessary emphasis on advancing the interests of the state, church, and private companies that all vied for a piece of our rightful land. With their greed and ambition consuming them, the Mittelafrikan monstrosity has collapsed and with it, so too has the Vrijstaat and this unholy trinity. We now stand free of the vile ‘politique indigène’ that oppressed our people for centuries, but we are not safe yet. To arms, true sons of Kivu and the Congo, for we finally march to slay the colonial beast once and for all!"

KIV_enemies_on_all_fronts:0 "Our Backs To The Wall"
KIV_enemies_on_all_fronts_desc:0 "The Congo has devolved into a blood and lead-filled maelstrom, and we are beset upon from all sides by Africans and Imperialists alike. Surrounding our mercurial borders lies the burning remains of the Vrijstaat, with the mercenaries and the Force Publique rising to the West as the newly-independent and ever-extravagant Union Minière takes hold off Katanga to the south. We have nowhere to fall back to, and no allies to call for. It is us against all of Congo, for this war for the Dark Heart of Africa."

KIV_advance_on_leopoldville:0 "Retake the Gem"
KIV_advance_on_leopoldville_desc:0 "Kinshasa, or Leopoldville as the imperialists call it, is the gem of our country. A metropolis by Central African standards, the city is both a vital economic center and rail hub. More importantly, its control over the Matadi-Leopoldville Railway is vital for our forces to control, for it serves as the only route of easy access to the Port of Matadi - the only major seaport in the Congo. We must retake the city at all costs!"

KIV_push_back_buganda:0 "Burn the Exploitative Hives"
KIV_push_back_buganda_desc:0 "On the fringes of the Congo, the opportunistic mercenaries lead by [KSV.getleader] and the greedy Union Minière of Katanga exploit our people and our lands, all in the pursuit of capitalist gain or self-centered ambitions. They crawl and chitter across our paradise like mites and maggots seeking to gnaw away at our resource-rich and bountiful birthright. We shall burn these insects where they stand, for no one shall exploit this Eden besides us!"

KIV_we_have_numbers_on_our_side:0 "The Native Wave"
KIV_we_have_numbers_on_our_side_desc:0 "What we lack in equipment and supplies, we more than make up for in sheer numbers. After decades upon decades of colonial rule, the presence of the White Man still pales in comparison to our might, for as hard as they tried, they could never replace us. We are a varied people numbering millions strong; we shall crash down upon these lost imperialists and suffocate them under our endless marching masses."

KIV_rally_the_congo_askari:0 "Rally the Congolese Askari"
KIV_rally_the_congo_askari_desc:0 "The small numbers of organized troops we have at our disposal are all members of the Askari or Force Publique - African soldiers who have long chafed under colonial rule but for their service have received training and arms beyond anything else currently in our employ. We must rally these elite veterans to serve as the vanguard for our uprising. The Congo will rise and the Askari shall lead us there!"

KIV_future_of_the_congo_desc:0 "Arise, my fellow Congolese and stand with me. We have thrown off the shackles of Imperialist oppression and have given birth to a sovereign and free nation here in the Congo. Not since the Teke Kingdom and the Federation of the Bakuba has the Congo seen a free, native-led state free from foreign meddling and greed. Our land is smoldering and our people carry on battered and scarred, but we have triumphed. Congo is free at last!"

KIV_the_age_old_question:0 "A Dance of Évolués and Askari"
KIV_the_age_old_question_desc:0 "With our independence secured, the Congolese people now stand at a crossroads. The ‘General’ Louis de Gonzague Bobozo has led the newly-birthed Armée Nationale Congolaise from the ruins of the old White-led Askari command structure, and with his military’s efficacy, this young but charismatic soldier has ruled as the de-facto rules of this so-called ‘Kivu Clique’. However, the cries of a newborn democratic movement gnaw away at the stability of the nation each day, as nationalist and socialist elements bubble and foment under our society’s surface. The Congo one again sits on the edge of drastic change."

KIV_gonzauges_guidance_desc:0 "Louis de Gonzague Bobozo, or General Gonzague as he has become known, has decided to shrug off the growing calls for democracy and instead continue to establish this young Congolese state under the wise and measured guidance of military rule.

Since the time of the first Portuguese expeditions that revealed our lands to these dogs to the horrific and shameful acts committed against freedom and sovereignty during the Scramble for Africa, our people have just been mere playthings or obstacles to the imperialists’ greed. This ends, finally, for General Gonzague and his loyal forces in the ANC shall remove the ones smart enough to leave peacefully, and eradicate those naive or foolish enough to resist. Congo is for the Congolese!"

KIV_formalize_the_military_government_desc:0 "The Askari, and the wider ANC at large, have steadily seen an increase to their powers and prominence within Congolese society since the rise of the Young General Gonzague. With these veterans and soldiers already practically running every facet of our government already, it is time to make this official. Aside from just the bureaucracy as before, the entire political and governmental apparatus of the Congo shall be organized across military lines.

From Duvalier in Haiti and Garvey in America to the titans of Africa like Padmore, Nkrumah, Obama, and Kenyatta, General Gonzague has pulled from many sources to begin to formulate his own unique blend of Pan-African thought. Denying the traditional Left-Right split that has plagued the movement for decades, Gonzague now seeks to pursue his own path, free of the influence of the ANC’s old guard as he begins to dream of a one, united Africa."

However, this Elder Statesman of the Bangala people is revered by Congolese both far and wide as a national father and teacher, with Balikango himself actually educating a number of ministers and congressmen that now serve as his own political allies and rivals, all many years his junior. With this reputation and support behind him, Balikango shall now guide the Congolese people into a new, republican destiny."

KIV_askari_retirement_fund_desc:0 "It was on the backs and with the blood of the Askari that Congo’s independence was won. Without these veterans, our shining republic would have been but a mere distant dream in the minds of servants, slaves, and deadmen. Despite many of them serving under the regime of the imperialists before the Collapse, these men have proven that they are true sons of the Congo. Pensions, housing-assistance, jobs, and more will be provided to these heroes, and the people they saved shall pay for it."

KIV_reduce_reliance_on_imports:0 "Congolese Self-Sufficiency"
KIV_reduce_reliance_on_imports_desc:0 "The Congo is one of the most resource rich and populous single areas on Earth - it is high time we capitalized on this fact ourselves and not let foreign capitalists steal away our rightful natural bounty and manpower. Though we can still accept trade deals that are agreeable to our own interests, especially with Balikango’s beloved Brussels, our new republic will strive to be able to act to a far greater degree of self-sufficient than it ever has before. Without our own native industry and socioeconomic structures, our attempts at nation-building will be doomed to fail from the beginning. "

KIV_establish_basic_infrastructure_desc:0 "Our state needs to strive towards modernization without losing touch with the roots that created us. With the help of Balikango’s Flandro-Wallonian contacts, the seeds of a modern nation will be planted in our lands. New roads, housing, electrical lines, railroad, and more shall be built across the Congo as modern amenities such as radios or refrigeration are slowly introduced overtime to our urban populations. It shall be a long and expensive road, but the Congolese people will get their taste of modernity."

KIV_solidify_beuracracy:0 "Solidify Our Bureaucracy"
KIV_solidify_beuracracy_desc:0 "Our new republic needs a strong bureaucracy if our government is to adequately meet the needs of the Congolese people in an efficient and orderly fashion.

Under his wise and measured rule, the Congolese people are united in their shared love for their newfound independence and slowly growing unified identity. Through faith, liberty, and patriotism, our people have found a home all Congolese can be proud of."

KIV_ABAKO_victory:0 "Kasa-Vubu’s ABAKO"
KIV_ABAKO_victory_desc:0 "Joseph Kasa-Vubu and his Alliance des Bakongo have won the first free and nationwide elections in the Congo’s history. Getting his start in politics serving in a clandestine anti-colonialist group before the Collapse, Kasa-Vubu has risen to lead ABAKO and represent the interests of the Bakongo people. Espousing both liberal-conseravtive and nationalist ideals, Kasa-Vubu seeks to create an ethnic federation here in the Congo, united through a faith, anti-Western ideals, and a shared Congolese identity without losing touch with our varied and unique roots."

KIV_reprisal_for_leopolds_crimes_desc:0 "Leopold was a curse upon the people of the Congo. He slaughtered thousands of Congolese innocents and broke the backs or took the hands of countless more, and though his rule has grown into a distant yet harsh memory, the Vrijstaat’s terror under the Force Publique was little better. The remaining colonists and imperialists in our lands must be made to pay for their crimes and the crimes of their dead King, both in gold and in blood."

KIV_favour_the_bakongo_desc:0 "ABAKO, though emphasising anti-Western attitudes and native Christian faith, is, above all, a nationalist party aimed at furthering the interests of the Bakongo - the true children of the Congo. Serving as both a political party and ethno-religious organization, ABAKO and its leader Kasa-Vubu’s top priority is the furthering of our people. Our language, our faiths, our culture, and our entire way of being and righteous and pure - so much so that all true Bakongo will receive ample extra benefits and social services from the state." 

KIV_ethnic_federalism:0 "A Federation of Ethnic Equals..."
KIV_ethnic_federalism_desc:0 "The new Congolese republic must embrace its unique constituent identities and ethnicities and not hide behind the facade of a central and unified ‘nationality.’ Sure we all live in the Congo, but we are not all just Congolese; we are Zande, Songye, Luba, Kundu, Mbole, Hamba, Komo, Ngata, and so many more. Together, but unique, shall be the way forward for the Congo and all its people..."

KIV_some_are_more_equal_than_others_desc:0 "...but of all the people of the Congo, none are more purely Congolese than the Bakongo. The Bakongo and their sister peoples such as the Wumbu, Kakongo, Mboma, Nkanu, Bazombo, and a select few others stand as the purest and most righteous of all the ‘Congolese.’ These groups shall be the chosen sons of our government, and receive special treatment and rewards fitting of these heirs to the Kingdom of Kongo."

KIV_unity_through_nationalism:0 "Unity Through Nationalism"
KIV_unity_through_nationalism_desc:0 "Ethnic Nationalism is a core tenet of our party and of President Kasa-Vubu’s own personal beliefs. The myriad people of the Congo, though varied in their standing and prestige, are among the most prestigious and pure people on this planet. Our home is a cradle to our very species and our people have lived here for untold millenia. This proud tradition is now carried on by our infantile republic, and we shall not sully this legacy lightly. The era of a European Congo is over, and the era of a Congolese Congo has just begun!"

KIV_urban_industrialization:0 "Urban Industrialization"
KIV_urban_industrialization_desc:0 "Congo has but a few cities that peak out from the jungles and monsoon forests that attempt to suffocate any patch not left overgrown or developed.

KIV_rural_development_schemes:0 "Rural Development Schemes"
KIV_rural_development_schemes_desc:0 "As we endeavor to build up our cities and industry, we must not let the rural countryside of our nation fall into the gutter as a result. Our more isolated or less densely populated regions could do with new infrastructure to better connect them to the wider nation’s web while electrification and clean water initiatives would do wonders for our people. The ‘unwashed masses’ of the Congo will reap the benefits of our rule as well!"

KIV_KONAKAT_victory_desc:0 "Moïse Tshombe and his Confédération des Associations Tribales du Katanga have won the first free and nationwide elections in the Congo’s history. This upstart accountant turned politician has served as a major figure in Katanga’s financial sector, growing famous for his expertise in economics and infamous for his ties to the Union Minière. Under Tshombe, the Congo will endeavor to strengthen our constituent region’s and their unique identities while pursuing profit above all else."

KIV_deregulate_buisness:0 "A Keynesian Congo"
KIV_deregulate_buisness_desc:0 "All business and market actions across the Congo will be largely deregulated, smothering the influence of the Invisible Hand over our newly-freed economy. The freer the markets, the freer the people, and with our newly won independence, the Congolese people are just about the most free people on Earth. CONAKAT has long preached to make the resources of Katanga exclusively and authentically Katanagese, so we shall apply this principle to the wider Congo at large. Onwards towards our Keynesian-inspired future!"

KIV_invite_western_investors_desc:0 "The unique identities that have formed in the various regions of the Congo from the unique local mixture of ethnicities and tribes is truly one-of-a-kind on this planet. We should embrace this regional identity and set up regional administration to govern each cohesive regional unit, for the leading party already does with their beloved Katanga."

KIV_sell_out_to_UMKH:0 "Sell Out to the UMHK"
KIV_sell_out_to_UMKH_desc:0 "The Union Minière du Haut-Katanga is the largest company in the Congo, accounting for nearly 70% of our national economy. Any party willing to get anything done in this nation has to go through them, but Tshombe has long held friendly ties and business relations with this industrial conglomerate. By allowing the Union Minière free reign within our economy, the Congo as a whole and Tshombe himself will be rewarded handsomely as the economy is revolutionized, westernized, and modernized on a national scale. However, much of the profits will still be going into the pockets of these former imperialists."

KIV_privatize_colonial_era_companies:0 "Privatize Colonial-Era Companies"
KIV_privatize_colonial_era_companies_desc:0 "The Tshombe regime has decided to privatize all former colonial companies within the Congo’s borders, bursting open the floodgates for thousands of our people to jump at the chance to own their own business and companies. Though most will be bought up by the small minority of established, wealthy Évolués, the mere opportunity being available has been enough to stimulate our economy. Our profit margins soar ever higher as we build a true entrepreneurial class for our republic."

KIV_state_owned_conglomerates:0 "State Owned Conglomerates"
KIV_state_owned_conglomerates_desc:0 "The Tshombe regime has decided to nationalize all former colonial companies within the Congo’s borders, massively inflating the resources at the government’s disposal and the responsibilities they must now be accountable for. President Tshombe himself is delighted, able to siphon off as much money from this ever-growing pot as he pleases as he uses the rest to drag the Congo into a modern and westernized future."

KIV_first_neoconoly:0 "The First Neo-Colony"
KIV_first_neoconoly_desc:0 "Tshombe’s policies have evolved our independent and free republic into the world’s first example of ‘Neo-Colonialism’ at work. Though the jackboots and whip cracking of the imperialists are gone, their greedy propensity to sniff out profit wherever it can be found is not. Our president along with CONAKAT has managed to nearly sell out all of the Congo’s private business sector to foreign investors and financiers, with the few not owned by outside hands being run by the Tshombe regime itself. The Congo is richer than anyone ever could have imagined, and its domestic industry continues to boom, but the foreign imperialist still continues to profit off the backs of the Congolese."

kivu.1.t:0 "The Natives Rage Against the Colonial Machine"
kivu.1.d:0 "What has become known as the ‘Kivue Clique’ is a loose conglomerate of nationalists, Askari, socialists, democrats, and any other native or tribal association willing to join this mishmashed cause in a shared pursuit of true Congolese sovereignty and an end to the imperialist system in the Congo for good. With the bulk of this coalition being made up of various democratic elements and disgruntled Askari veterans and auxiliaries, these camps have come to dominate the clique. Leading this ragtag group is ‘General’ Louis de Gonzague Bobozo, a young firebrand who has been chosen by the Askari old guard and his peers to be the face of this resistance movement. Under this young General, the Kivu Clique has risen up in the Central African Lakes region of the Congo’s easternmost provinces, seeking to throw off the yoke of colonialism once and for all. Though their union may seem united and secure on the surface, tensions have risen internally over disagreements between the various constituent factions and the future is uncertain for this young native-rule movement. Regardless of their composition or cohesion, the Kivu Clique is dead-set on earning their sovereignty at all costs.
kivu.1.a:0 "Justice, Paix, Travail!"

kivu.2.t:0 "A Guided State or a Free Democracy?"
kivu.2.d:0 "With our independence secured and the horrors of the Congo Civil War finally fading into memory, the Young General Gonzague must now make a choice. Since the birth of this so-called ‘Kivu Clique,’ the Young General and his Askari have led the true Congolese as our enemies assailed us from all sides. Their rule brought us stability and eventual victory, but now that the guns have grown silent, the people of the Congo finally wish to be heard. \n\nHowever, Gonzague also has recognized that his people may not be truly ready to lead themselves, for they have long languished under colonial rule and been forced to fall behind and become naive to the ins and outs of experienced statecraft. The Young General, however, has earned his experience firsthand in the fires of our revolution, and as such has earned the right to guide his fellow Congolese into their shared future more than any other man in this primordial jungle. \n\nThe Young General must his decision, and make it carefully, for his choice here shall cast the die for millions as he lays the foundations for the first independent state in the Congo in nearly a century."
kivu.2.a:0 "Free elections must be held to finally give the people of the Congo a voice."
kivu.2.b:0 "We can not let matters of the state be left to the uneducated and naive masses."

kivu.3.t:0 "The First Post-Colonial Congolese Elections"
kivu.3.d:0 "With the Young General’s decision to step down, democracy has been saved, and the first fair and free elections for this new Congolese republic have been organized. Though many parties have been created for this occasion and have put names on the ballot, only three main parties hold any hope of winning. Notably absent from these elections have been the growing force of the MNC, which was disbarred from the elections given their vaguely Socialist leanings, much to the chagrin of their party members. Besides these outcasts, ABAKO, CONAKAT, and the PUC all stand great chances at winning, each led by a titan of the Congolese independence movement. Who shall win is anyone’s guess in this closely contested race, but by the end of tonight, the Republic of the Congo will have its first president!"
