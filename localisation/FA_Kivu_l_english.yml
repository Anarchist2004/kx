### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_LOUIS_BOBOZO_DESC:0 "The last thing young Gonzague imagined in his career as a German Askari is to be leading one of the biggest states in the now-free Africa. Born in the later years of the Belgian Congo and then Mittelafrika - he was enthralled by the discipline and exploits of the Askari. He signed up in 1933 and quickly rose through the ranks through his great leadership skills after squashing several revolts and guerrilla groups on behalf of his Hunnic masters. However his true loyalty was always with his people. When the Governor of the Congo ordered his division to pacify Kivu and his home state of the northwest with senselessly brutality, he decided to stand up for his people by organizing a mutiny. Despite his really young age, he rallied most of the Congo's African-majority armies under his banner and overthrew their German masters. Now young Gonzague stands at a crossroads - his fledgling clique is surrounded on all sides by enemies, and his government is rife with incompetence due to his lack of political experience from his young age. Will the Kivu Clique lead the Congo to it's deserved glory, or will it fall to the other warlords and tribes vying for the same level of power?"

With their greed and ambition consuming them, the Mittelafrikan monstrosity has collapsed and with it, so too has the Vrijstaat and this unholy trinity.

A metropolis by Central African standards, the city is both a vital economic center and rail hub. More importantly, its control over the Matadi-Leopoldville Railway is vital for our forces to control, for it serves as the only route of easy access to the Port of Matadi - the only major seaport in the Congo.

However, the cries of a newborn democratic movement gnaw away at the stability of the nation each day, as nationalist and socialist elements bubble and foment under our society’s surface.

Since the time of the first Portuguese expeditions that revealed our lands to these dogs to the horrific and shameful acts committed against freedom and sovereignty during the Scramble for Africa, our people have just been mere playthings or obstacles to the imperialists’ greed.

KIV_formalize_the_military_government_desc:0 "The Askari, and the wider ANC at large, have steadily seen an increase to their powers and prominence within Congolese society since the rise of the Young General Gonzague. With these veterans and soldiers already practically running every facet of our government already, it is time to make this official.

From Duvalier in Haiti and Garvey in America to the titans of Africa like Padmore, Nkrumah, Obama, and Kenyatta, General Gonzague has pulled from many sources to begin to formulate his own unique blend of Pan-African thought. Denying the traditional Left-Right split that has plagued the movement for decades, Gonzague now seeks to pursue his own path, free of the influence of the ANC’s old guard as he begins to dream of a one, united Africa."

All hail Nzere, all hail Gonzague, for Gonzague is Nzere."

KIV_young_officer_stratocracy:0 "Young Officer Stratocracy"
KIV_young_officer_stratocracy_desc:0 "With our military government firmly established, it is time we begin to evolve this air of martial rule to its natural conclusion.

The best among them shall rise to the top to lead our people while those officers unfit to lead our nation shall instead lead our troops into battle, following better men along the way.

Under the Young General and his clique of eager, voracious officers and generals, the Congo has been transformed into one of the most militarized places on Earth. All citizens upon reaching a certain age are conscripted into the military for life, filling out the various duties and tasks any state and army requires to function, all under the jurisdiction and command of General Gonzague and an oppressive atmosphere of martial law. The Congo is its army, and its army is Congo!"

Under the Young General Gonzague, everything from the smallest piece of timber cut from our famous hardwoods to the largest vein of uranium ore from Shinkolobwe belongs to the ANC. Every man, woman, and child serves their role in the military stratocracy, and everyone has their set purpose.

However, this Elder Statesman of the Bangala people is revered by Congolese both far and wide as a national father and teacher, with Balikango himself actually educating a number of ministers and congressmen that now serve as his own political allies and rivals, all many years his junior. With this reputation and support behind him, Balikango shall now guide the Congolese people into a new, republican destiny."

President Balikango, a devout Catholic himself, has decided to establish close and formal ties with the Papacy, offering them tax breaks and greater incentives as they establish more missions and churches in our lands.

Though we can still accept trade deals that are agreeable to our own interests, especially with Balikango’s beloved Brussels, our new republic will strive to be able to act to a far greater degree of self-sufficient than it ever has before.

CONAKAT has long preached to make the resources of Katanga exclusively and authentically Katanagese, so we shall apply this principle to the wider Congo at large. Onwards towards our Keynesian-inspired future!"

KIV_invite_western_investors:0 "Embrace Regionalism"
KIV_invite_western_investors_desc:0 "The unique identities that have formed in the various regions of the Congo from the unique local mixture of ethnicities and tribes is truly one-of-a-kind on this planet. We should embrace this regional identity and set up regional administration to govern each cohesive regional unit, for the leading party already does with their beloved Katanga."

KIV_sell_out_to_UMKH:0 "Sell Out to the UMHK"
KIV_sell_out_to_UMKH_desc:0 "The Union Minière du Haut-Katanga is the largest company in the Congo, accounting for nearly 70% of our national economy. Any party willing to get anything done in this nation has to go through them, but Kasa-Vubu has long held friendly ties and business relations with this industrial conglomerate. By allowing the Union Minière free reign within our economy, the Congo as a whole and Kasa-Vubu himself will be rewarded handsomely as the economy is revolutionized, westernized, and modernized on a national scale. However, much of the profits will still be going into the pockets of these former imperialists."

KIV_privatize_colonial_era_companies:0 "Privatize Colonial-Era Companies"
KIV_privatize_colonial_era_companies_desc:0 "The Kasa-Vubu regime has decided to privatize all former colonial companies within the Congo’s borders, bursting open the floodgates for thousands of our people to jump at the chance to own their own business and companies. Though most will be bought up by the small minority of established, wealthy Évolués, the mere opportunity being available has been enough to stimulate our economy. Our profit margins soar ever higher as we build a true entrepreneurial class for our republic."

KIV_state_owned_conglomerates:0 "State Owned Conglomerates"
KIV_state_owned_conglomerates_desc:0 "The Kasa-Vubu regime has decided to nationalize all former colonial companies within the Congo’s borders, massively inflating the resources at the government’s disposal and the responsibilities they must now be accountable for. President Kasa-Vubu himself is delighted, able to siphon off as much money from this ever-growing pot as he pleases as he uses the rest to drag the Congo into a modern and westernized future."

KIV_first_neoconoly:0 "The First Neo-Colony"
KIV_first_neoconoly_desc:0 "Tshombe’s policies have evolved our independent and free republic into the world’s first example of ‘Neo-Colonialism’ at work. Though the jackboots and whip cracking of the imperialists are gone, their greedy propensity to sniff out profit wherever it can be found is not. Our president along with CONAKAT has managed to nearly sell out all of the Congo’s private business sector to foreign investors and financiers, with the few not owned by outside hands being run by the Kasa-Vubu regime itself. The Congo is richer than anyone ever could have imagined, and its domestic industry continues to boom, but the foreign imperialist still continues to profit off the backs of the Congolese."

kivu.1.t:0 "The Natives Rage Against the Colonial Machine"
kivu.1.d:0 "What has become known as the ‘Kivue Clique’ is a loose conglomerate of nationalists, Askari, socialists, democrats, and any other native or tribal association willing to join this mishmashed cause in a shared pursuit of true Congolese sovereignty and an end to the imperialist system in the Congo for good. With the bulk of this coalition being made up of various democratic elements and disgruntled Askari veterans and auxiliaries, these camps have come to dominate the clique. Leading this ragtag group is ‘General’ Louis de Gonzague Bobozo, a young firebrand who has been chosen by the Askari old guard and his peers to be the face of this resistance movement. Under this young General, the Kivu Clique has risen up in the Central African Lakes region of the Congo’s easternmost provinces, seeking to throw off the yoke of colonialism once and for all. Though their union may seem united and secure on the surface, tensions have risen internally over disagreements between the various constituent factions and the future is uncertain for this young native-rule movement. Regardless of their composition or cohesion, the Kivu Clique is dead-set on earning their sovereignty at all costs.
