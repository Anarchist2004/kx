### Leader Bios ###
## Commune of France ##
POLITICS_SEBASTIEN_FAURE_DESC: "Sébastien Faure is the first Anarchiste to serve as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Originally empowered to chairman in a compromise between the Travailleurs and Anarchistes, factionalism has grown considerably during his time in office, and the apparatus of the state has weakened. If any faction manages to gain a clear majority in the Comité de Salut Public and the Bourse Générale du Travail, Faure is likely to be ousted."
POLITICS_LEON_JOUHAUX_DESC: "Léon Jouhaux has been elected Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Jouhaux, as a revolutionary trade unionist, participated in the general strike of 1919 which precipitated the Commune's establishment. He is an adherent of orthodox French syndicalism, a true centrist among the factions of the Commune."
POLITICS_BENOIT_FRACHON_DESC: "Benoît Frachon, a veteran of the French Civil War, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. While a Syndicalist, he is sympathetic towards the opposing anarchiste faction; to that end, he has declared mending the Commune's factionalism the chief goal of his chairmanship."
POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC: "General Maurice Gamelin has overthrown the Jacobin regime of Marcel Déat. While his coup is an obvious affront to the already dubious Communard democratic process, many now regard Gamelin as the saviour of the Commune, and even syndicalism itself."
POLITICS_MARCEL_CACHIN_DESC: "Marcel Cachin, former diplomat and bureau chief of the state-owned newspaper, Humanité, has become chairman of the Commune of France. While a Leninist, his diplomatic attitude and general charisma, allow him to retain some degree cordiality with syndicalists and anarchists."
POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC: "Georges Valois, an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny."
POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC: "Nestor Makhno, Ukrainian anarchist, fled his homeland for France following German intervention in the Russian Civil War. Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his French electoral victory. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the foreseeable future, but his support for decentralisation could forever transform the Commune."
POLITICS_JACQUES_DORIOT_DESC: "Jacques Doriot, veteran of the Weltkrieg, returned from captivity in Germany to find a France forever changed. His personal transformation from moderate socialist, to Leninist, and now national-syndicalist, has instilled in him an engrained proclivity for compromise."
POLITICS_VINCENT_AURIOL_DESC: "Vincent Auriol, long accused by hardline syndicalists of harbouring sympathies for the bourgeoisie, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. He advocates the gradual transition to a more democratic system of government in the Commune."
POLITICS_FELIX_GOUIN_DESC: ""
POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC: "Born as Alfred-Georges Gressent, to a working-class peasant family in 1878, Georges was invested in politics from an early age. Becoming an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel whilst working as his secretary, however he was not always a man of the left. After publishing political thought directly inspired by his mentor, Sorel, he became an acquaintance of monarchist writer Charles Maurras. Joining Maurras’s movement, Action Française, he developed his ideology of fusing working-class based politics with monarchism. In 1911 he founded the Cercle Proudhon with fellow AF comrades, this group espoused national-syndicalism, integral nationalism and antisemitism whilst rejecting liberal and conservative democracy. Overtime as syndicalist movements evolved throughout France, the Cercle became overtly left-wing whilst maintaining an aggressively nationalist stance on world politics. When the French Civil War broke out, Valois took advantage of the crisis by turning his group into a fully fledged political movement. The Sorelians were born, disowning any previous reactionary views, Valois and his comrades took to streets of a broken France to demand the destruction of the French Third Republic.\n\n Now he has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny. He has also advocated for vengeance against Germany and the reclamation of lost French territory."
POLITICS_MARCEL_DEAT_DESC: "Marcel Déat was born in 1894 to a modest family, in his youth he excelled at his studies and became involved in left-wing politics. A student of Radical politician Émile Chartier he joined the SFIO,  however this political stint came to end when the Weltkrieg broke out. A staunch patriot he enlisted in the French Army and saw active duty, earning the Legion of Honour and five bravery citations. The Weltkrieg shaped his political views, forging a deep hatred for Germany and the French elite who he saw as failing the nation. During the lead up the French Civil War, Déat has positioned himself to the right of the socialist movement, advocating for an authoritarian anti-capitalist state. His work was published by Valois who had taken interest in Déat and the two became fast allies, when the General Strike led to civil conflict Déat declared loyalty to the Sorelans.\n\nRepresenting the ‘Vanguardist’ faction of the Sorelians, Déat has proved himself to be an opportunist first, and ideologue second. Forging connections with former political enemies and taking action against fellow comrades, Déat has fought his way to the top of the Sorelian leadership. Now in control of the National Worker’s State, Chairman Déat can lead the authoritarian anti-capitalist regime he always envisioned."
POLITICS_MARCEL_BUCARD_DESC: "Many things Marcel Bucard has been called over the years. Syndicalist, Anti-semite, Nationalist, Worker. Beginning life as the son of a butcher in Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, Marcel Bucard initially studied to become a Catholic Priest. This all changed however with the outbreak of the Weltkrieg where he patriotically signed up to fight off the German horde in defense of the French nation rising through the ranks and winning admiration for fellow french patriots and friends in the trenches. No matter how hard he fought however the horrors of the war cemented his personal hatred for Germany and its mistreatment of the French people. Originally a reactionary, the Weltkrieg provided him with a deep hatred for the French upper-class who he saw as cowards for surrendering to the Germans. The revolutionary period that swept France saw the Bankers, Liberals, Capitalists, the exploiters of the French nation abandon it and flee with the riches of its people. Countering this was of the utmost personal importance to Bucard who joined Valois’s Sorelians, eventually taking leadership of his own faction, the ‘Ultranationalist-Syndicalists’. Giving speeches towards crowds of disenfranchised French patriots against 'Ruthless banking clans' and their 'Liberal lapdogs' he easily recruited among the galvanized Weltkrieg veterans.\n\nNow in control as the Chief of the National Worker’s State, Bucard sees the destruction of the German Empire as his main objective. To him, the superior French proletariat have smashed the chains of their masters and can no longer be defeated by any force!"
POLITICS_MAURICE_THOREZ_DESC: "Maurice Thorez was born in Pas-de-Calais, France on the 28th of April, 1900. Becoming a coal miner at the young age of 12. He would go on to join the French Section of the Workers’ International at the age of 19. His time in the SFIO introduced him to Marxist thought, causing him to become enamored with the ideas of Communism and a very enthusiastic supporter of the Bolshevik uprising in Russia. The ultimate failure of the Bolsheviks led Thorez to conclude that they had not been pure or strong enough, that they had failed both Lenin, Marx, and Robespierre by their inability to take every measure necessary for the revolution. Thorez would take up arms in the Second French Revolution, declaring himself as a syndicalist to disguise his true communist nature. A charismatic leader, many flocked to him for his bold speeches and devotion to the Revolution. Once the Commune of France had been established, however, he revealed his true colors, declaring the Commune a bourgeois fourth republic, and converting his followers to the ways of communism. Now calling themselves the “Jacobins” after the radicals of Robespierre, Thorez and his followers became an immense thorn in the side of the CGT. Considering himself to be the successor to Robespierre and Lenin, Thorez would be dismissed as a political failure for his inability to win a seat in the CGT. But now with his rule secured by his astounding victory in the 1936 elections, the “political failure” is determined to live up to his predecessors and crush all who stand in his way of creating a true Communist French utopia."
POLITICS_FRENCH_COUNCIL_DESC: "With Chairman Valois now dead, power has been vested within the Sorelian Council. Valois never named his successor in the event of his death, therefore to avoid further conflict the Comité de Salut Public was formed. Chaired by Peirre Laval, the council lacks unity with it being split between two competing factions. Valois’s secretary, Marcel Déat leads the Vanguardists whilst commander of the Revolutionary Legion, Marcel Bucard, leads the Ultranational-Syndicalists. With the threat of anarchy looming, can the council unify behind a single leader or will it collapse..."
POLITICS_BLACK_GUARD_DESC: "Officially the ‘Free Territory of France’ has no leader, upon liberating towns Makhno’s men have announced their intention to leave all governing to the workers themselves. Laws and authority is enforced by fully autonomous communes which are usually commanded by a worker’s council. However despite this supposed unlimited freedom and abolition of all hierarchies, the most powerful man in the nation is undoubtedly Nestor Makhno. His role as the protector of anarchy allows him command large numbers of Black Guard soldiers who station themselves across the Free Territory. When his men require rest and food the citizens of communes oblige, Makhno chooses to not involve himself in the politics of anarchist communes however it would be unwise to challenge any decision he could make..."
POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC: "Born into a military family, 20 September 1872, Maurice Gustave Gamelin was always destined for military greatness. Entering into the Saint-Cyr Military Academy he graduated first in his class, going on to serve in Tunisia. Serving as attaché to future Marshal of France, General Joseph Joffre, this position provided Gamelin with a solid knowledge of strategic and tactical warfare. During the Weltkrieg he distinguished himself for helping plan the victory at the Battle of the Marne. Quickly being promoted all the way to Brigadier General however with the German offensive of 1918 pushing further and further into France, Gamelin was recalled to Paris. Leading a desperate defence of the capital he held the lines just long enough for a civilian extraction saving countless lives. After the war he maintained a high ranking position in the military, as civil tension escalated he refused to allow politics to sway his loyalty to France. When the syndicalist revolutionaries were successful, Gamelin offered his services to the government and was made Marshal of the Commune of France. This came to an end when the Jacobin regime was declared.\n\nAs the Jacobin rule of tyranny tore France apart, Gamelin realised that his backseat in politics must end. Forging an alliance Léon Blum, a Popular Front backed by the military, has overthrown Thorez’s dictatorship with Gamelin proclaimed as Maréchal. Many now regard Gamelin as the defender of Communard democracy, and saviour of France."
POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC: "Born into a poor peasantry family in Ukraine, 26 October 1888, Nestor Ivanovych Makhno was forced to adapt quickly to a harsh life. Extreme poverty led to him finding work for himself, being employed at a local iron foundry he witnessed the rise of revolutionary anti-Tsarist politics. Having experienced the Tsarist Regime’s brutality himself he joined local anarchists and took part in robberies resulting in his imprisonment. When the Weltkrieg broke out he remained a prisoner, sentenced to death by hanging, this came to end with the Russian Revolution. Being freed he left for Ukraine, forming connections with anarchists he established the ‘Black Army’ to fight against both Ukrainian nationalists and the intervening German forces. When Germany secured its dominance of the nation he fled his homeland for France.\n\n Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his popularity and notability in French politics. Forming the ‘Black Guard’ terrorist organization which has now overthrown the Sorelian regime. With the failures of Ukraine and France, Makhno has been further radicalised by the Illegalists. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the foreseeable future. However his efforts to destroy any remnants of authority in the commune with the establishment of the ‘Free Territory of France’ have so far been successful. These successes may be in vain however, for his personal army of anarchists are the only thing that can prevent France’s neighbours from taking advantage of this chaos..."

### Ideas ###

THINT_exact_vengeance: "Desire for Revenge"

FRA_communard_spirit_idea: "Communard Spirit"
FRA_communard_spirit_idea_desc: "We are the legacy of the Paris Commune, the first socialist state ever created and then brutally repressed by the Republican reactionaries. In 1920, the workers finally got their revenge and overthrew the military junta of the 'Party of Order'. We, sons and daughters of Communards must protect our state and our spirit, we will not be commanded by tyrants anymore!"

FRA_bad_intel: "Inefficient Intelligence"
FRA_bad_intel_desc: "Ever since the Party of Order tried to stifle the worker's uprising in France, the idea of a centralised intelligence service is seen by many as a hallmark of the reactionary oppression of the post-Weltkrieg social movements. As a result, the Commune's intelligence services are limited to extremely scrutinised intelligence committees to prevent a repeat of this situation."

FRA_to_war_idea: "Revanchist Rearment"
FRA_to_war_idea_desc: "Our nation must rise again, if we want to defeat the Imperialists!"

#The three following ideas are extremely weird. Are they intended? Especially the third. Travailleurs and Sorelians both share it... I'm picking Travailleurs for now
FRA_economic_reforms_anar: "Economic Reforms"
FRA_economic_reforms_anar_desc: "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

FRA_economic_reforms_jaco: "Economic Reforms"
FRA_economic_reforms_jaco_desc: "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

FRA_economic_reforms: "Economic Reforms"
FRA_economic_reforms_desc: "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

FRA_military_buildup_two_idea: "Calibrated Economy"
FRA_military_buildup_two_idea_desc: "As the world slowly approaches war again, we can rapidly capitalise on our healthy economy to rapidly switch parts of our economy to focus on military build-up. More factories are dedicated on arming our soldiers and building military structures, without any severe impact on our population."

FRA_ruralism_idea: "Ruralism"
FRA_ruralism_idea_desc: "The wide-reaching reforms to our industry and economy means than we no longer have massive industrial centres surrounding populous cities. This incidentally makes any attempt by enemy forces to cripple or even destroy our economy that much harder, with the biggest rural industrial centres far smaller and far more numerous than the great industry centres of Europe."

FRA_market_socialism_idea: "Market Socialism"
FRA_market_socialism_idea_desc: "Market Socialism is far more than a socialist interpretation of a market economy. By putting all the new worker cooperatives in a fair and equal competitive economy, we can make our civilian economy more dynamic and more efficient without having to directly intervene or go through slow, bloated unions in most cases."

FRA_mass_production_idea: "Mass Production"
FRA_mass_production_idea_desc: "Factories have always had a serious advantage over the artisan. By chaining production tasks, they can produce in a small frame of time infinitely more product without nearly equal quality. Instead of trying to constantly reinvent that process, let's improve on it. We seek absolute efficiency in production to beat the German capitalists."

FRA_modern_farms_idea: "Modern Farms"
FRA_modern_farms_idea_desc: "Farms are often seen as an old, quaint detail of the national economy, but we know better. By modernising and mechanising the Commune's farmlands, we can massively increase our agricultural output and both speed up and optimise harvest, production, refining and delivery. To our civilians, and to our troops."

FRA_war_eco_agri_idea: "War, Economy and Agriculture"
FRA_war_eco_agri_idea_desc: "Pioneered by Sorelian economy minister Jacques Doriot, the concept of War, Economy and Agriculture is an interesting one. Claiming that a war with Germany is not only inevitable but fast approaching, the Sorelians demand a rapid conversion to an economy whose industry can not only sustain a war, but whose agriculture can sustain its soldiers. In sum, a sort of total war economy."

FRA_inter_coop_idea: "International Cooperation"
FRA_inter_coop_idea_desc: "There is no shame in seeing what other countries are doing, and borrowing their new economic and industrial ideas to improve our own. Obviously, there are very few ideas we can seriously borrow from capitalist and reactionary societies, but our fellow Syndicalist brothers are fine examples at times."

FRA_dedication_idea: "Sense of Dedication"
FRA_dedication_idea_desc: "French workers work for more than their pay, and they certainly do not work at gunpoint. Every can they seal, every brick they lay, every rifle they assemble, every tank they weld together, is a service to their country and the spirit of the Commune at large."

FRA_industralization_idea: "Communal Industrialisation"
FRA_industralization_idea_desc: "Pioneered by Jacobin economy minister Jean Jérôme, Industrialisation is no strange concept to anyone in the Commune or abroad. This policy aims to rapidly increase the industrial capacity of France in order to catch up to our arch nemesis Germany. This is accompanied by a work culture and the creation of dedicated factory towns."

FRA_mass_fire_support_idea: "Mass Fire Support"
FRA_mass_fire_support_idea_desc: "Every man has his rifle and grenade, every squad has its machine gun. By organising our divisions to provide fire to each other, we can another a new layer of fire support. Every time a division advances, all the other divisions suppress the enemy. By doing this in waves, we can rapidly gain ground. Now to supply the equipment needed."

FRA_mass_conscription_idea: "Mass Conscription"
FRA_mass_conscription_idea_desc: "Whereas our enemies have trouble enlisting enough soldiers to fight their reactionary and imperialist wars, every man is ready to fight for the Commune. Let us mobilise as many as our economy can sustain, we will overwhelm the reactionaries with our ultimate dedication to the Commune."

FRA_empower_rifleman_idea: "Empower the Rifleman"
FRA_empower_rifleman_idea_desc: "The Rifleman is more than a soldier with a gun. For too long he has been seen as incapable of any higher thinking other than firing his rifle by monarchist officers, seeing the working man with disdain. We will not make this mistake, the Rifleman should decide local tactics, increasing his efficiency on the battlefield."

FRA_military_academy_idea: "Military Academy"
FRA_military_academy_idea_desc: "We have to face the harsh reality that the Weltkrieg led to the downfall of most of our prestigious, if reactionary, military academies. While some claim this to be an acceptable status quo, we know better. Let us invest in new military academies to train skilled officers, for the future of the Communal Army."

FRA_centralized_hc_idea: "Centralised High Command"
FRA_centralized_hc_idea_desc: "The new Communal Army was not built like the old French army, many Communards resenting the military administration that tried to stifle the Commune, but we cannot leave our Officer Corps shattered. Let us centralise our High Command again, to better organise things some people like to forget, like logistics."

FRA_tank_quality_line_idea: "Quality Tank Production"
FRA_tank_quality_line_idea_desc: "What good is a tank if it doesn't perform as well as enemy tanks? We should not sacrifice on quality in favour of quantity, all this will lead to is more burning husks on the battlefield. Quality tanks, even if fewer in numbers, will take many times their numbers, making them a safe return on investment."

FRA_tank_assembly_line_idea: "Tank Assembly Line"
FRA_tank_assembly_line_idea_desc: "What good is a tank if the enemies have many more to throw against us? We cannot let perfectionists sabotage our assembly lines for minimal gains, or else we will be outnumbered. Quantity will allow us to overwhelm our enemies with entire divisions of cold hard steel, and many more shells flying at them."

FRA_fast_army_idea: "Speed Cult"
FRA_fast_army_idea_desc: "Speed is more than a small advantage or a way to get to the next point faster. Speed is integral to warfare. Those who think that the next Weltkrieg will be fought in trenches are deluded at best, mobile warfare is the way of the future. We must capitalise on fast, motorised divisions, if not a motorised army."

FRA_Red_Army: "Red Grande Armee"
FRA_Red_Army_desc: "Our army is in better shape than ever to face the evils of this capitalist world."

Capital_Ship_Primacy: "Capital Ship Primacy"
Capital_Ship_Primacy_desc: "A grand navy will be crucial to defeat the Kaiserliche Marine and bring the pain to Germany's northern coast. And in that role, the grand Battleship still shines. Its naval artillery will flatten the reactionaries with rolling barrages of thunder and steel, and send their boats to the bottom of the sea."

Carrier_Primacy: "Carrier Primacy"
Carrier_Primacy_desc: "The future of naval warfare is not in big, clunky warships, but in a combined arms approach with another front of future warfare, air warfare. Let us ensure that every naval group has a Carrier. Its fighters will ensure global air dominance, its naval bombers will wreck enemy ships and harbours alike."

FRA_working_women_idea: "Working Women"
FRA_working_women_idea_desc: "For too long have women been suppressed by reactionary thinkers. Even under the French Republic, they selflessly supported the nation while our brothers were sent to the slaughter. It is time for us to recognise their contribution to society, and formalise the rights of the working woman, in peace and war."

FRA_bhartiya_support: "French Military Support"
FRA_bhartiya_support_desc: "We are receiving military support from our French allies. This selfless assistance will prove critical to defeating the reactionary Princely Federation and the imperialist Dominion of India. In time, we hope to repay France for their help, but for now we must focus on the task at hand."

FRA_amenagement_idea: "Aménagement of the Territory"
FRA_amenagement_idea_desc: "France has historically been a very centralised country, meaning that most of the development has been limited to industrial cities and population centres. We have funded large projects to ensure that all parts of our territory are developed to a satisfactory manner."

FRA_plan_prost_idea: "Plan Prost"
FRA_plan_prost_idea_desc: "Henri Prost's plans for highways linking the Paris suburbs has proved to be popular across the country. Many other municipalities like Lyon or Marseille have also signed up to the plan, and projects are already being drawn for a large highway network linking all of France's major cities together, from Lille to Toulouse."

FRA_paramilitary_gendarmes: "Paramilitary Gendarmes"
FRA_paramilitary_gendarmes_desc: "The Gendarmes are a fine organisation, a paramilitary police force capable of both civilian and military activities. While many have pushed to completely disband them, we will instead expand their activities to make them a parallel force to the French Communal Police."

FRA_secret_police: "Secret Police"
FRA_secret_police_desc: "There are still many enemies of the Commune inside the Commune, sometimes even inside positions of power or within the military. This push for transparency is dangerous, we must instead organise secret police operations to ensure the safety of the French people from internal influences."

FRA_demo_surete: "Sûreté Populaire Démocratique"
FRA_demo_surete_desc: "We cannot allow paranoia to lead to the destruction of the fine balance we achieved with the Sûreté Populaire. By democratising the organisation, we will ensure that the French respect the Police not by fear but by an understanding of their actions and goals, and by knowing that they serve them first and foremost."

FRA_hawkish_renseignements: "Revolutionary Renseignements"
FRA_hawkish_renseignements_desc: "The Renseignements Généraux must ensure our safety from reactionary enemies abroad. Simple counter-espionage is not adequate, we must be ready to spy on enemy countries and support Syndicalist movements across the world. A good offence is the best defence."

FRA_peace_renseignements: "Protective Renseignements"
FRA_peace_renseignements_desc: "The Renseignements Généraux must ensure the safety of our country above all else. Counter-espionage is the centrepiece of an effective national defence, and there are many enemies that wait for a moment of weakness to influence and rile up our population."

FRA_peaceful_revolution_idea: "Peaceful Revolution"
FRA_peaceful_revolution_idea_desc: "The International Syndicalist Revolution will come, but it will be civilised. With the main reactionary powers in Europe finally shattered and their workers liberated, we aim to encourage further uprisings by merely proving the superiority of Syndicalism to the whole world."

FRA_amateur_pilots_idea: "Amateur Pilots"
FRA_amateur_pilots_idea_desc: "There are many in our country that have taken up flying as a hobby or a vocation, but not all of them pursue careers in the Air Force. They should preferably be drafted to our air force, where their skills will increase our chances of finding the new Aces of the Air."

FRA_ecole_air_idea: "Ecole de l'Air"
FRA_ecole_air_idea_desc: "Flying is a skill by itself, and flying well in combat conditions is something that you can't just learn overnight. We won't repeat the mistakes of the Weltkrieg and its butcher of novice pilots, we need a large roster of well trained air pilots, and competent officers to lead them."

FRA_waves_of_syndicalism_idea: "Waves of Syndicalism"
FRA_waves_of_syndicalism_idea_desc: "The Commune's navy is mighty, and its reach is as far as we desire it to be. While we might lack the plentiful, worldwide ports of the French Empire of old, we still aim to have a navy that can intervene to any corner of the world at any time."

FRA_cut_off_capitalists_idea: "Cut off the Capitalists"
FRA_cut_off_capitalists_idea_desc: "The capitalists still pride themselves of their colonial territories. The fruit of their plunders still flow freely across the high seas. But if we have a say about it, we will ensure the stolen properties of the African, Asian and American workers will not enrich them."

French_Revanchism_idea: "French Revanchism"
French_Revanchism_idea_desc: "We have long prepared ourselves for this inevitable war. We have long cast away Pétain and his creed, but this does not mean we will forget what our brothers died for in the Ardennes, in Verdun, in the Chemin des Dames. We will avenge them, and once and for all regain what we deserved for our struggle."

French_Revanchism_idea2: "Social Patriotism"
French_Revanchism_idea2_desc: "It is not reactionary to be a patriot! To love the progress and equality granted by the nation, and to wish to defend said progress from imperialistic nations such as Germany. Vive la France!"


Revolutionary_spirit: "Revolutionary Spirit"
Revolutionary_spirit_desc: "The survival and prosperity of the Syndicalist world will only be ensured when the last reactionary bastion is terminated. We must stand ready to mobilise and shatter every reactionary government across the world. One day, the Internationale will extend across all seas and continents!"

FRA_socialist_education_idea: "Socialist Education"
FRA_socialist_education_idea_desc: "The education of the youth is one of the greatest goals that a country like the Commune may face. Luckily, the old education system of the Republic was already revolutionary for its day, giving us a good basis for the new one. A socialist education system, focused on the sciences and arts."

FRA_sorelians_supreme_idea_desc: "Goerges Valois’s victory has secured Sorelian power over France, already Legionaries have been stationed in key government buildings whilst the Red Eagle of Sorel is plastered over existing Syndicalist symbols.

Due to the increase in bombings and general disruption of every day life the nation's industrial output has been affected."
FRA_vanguards_in_power: "Vanguardist Sorelians In Power"
FRA_vanguards_in_power_desc: "Marcel Déat and his vanguardist allies have seized control of the Sorelian Council, ousting Bucard’s clique. Déat has proved himself to be a pragmatic opportunist, in the past he has forged alliances with unlikely figures and this newfound power will be no exception. Union leaders and those in favour of central planning and agricultural collectivisation have been promoted by Déat to positions of power whilst the more staunch nationalist Sorelians who have pushed for direct war with Germany have been relegated. There are even whispers of former Jacobins being accepted in Déat’s ranks. With the Vanguardists in full control France can be transformed into a true worker’s state."
FRA_ultranat: "Ultranational-Syndicalist Sorelians In Power"
FRA_ultranat_desc: "Marcel Bucard and his Ultranational-syndicalist allies have seized control of the Sorelian Council, ousting Déat’s clique. To many, Bucard is seen as a reactionary who switched sides to save his own skin, however despite this the new chairman has confirmed his commitment to crushing the bourgeoisie nations. Supported by both the military and the Revolutionary Legion, Bucard has forged alliances with left-wing nationalists eager to fight the Germans, but also with groups sidelined by the CGT such as futurists and technocrats. With the Ultranational-syndicalists in full control, France can continue its transformation into a strong nation state."

Two revolutionary factions once allied together for the common cause of destroying the decayed Third Republic are now at each other's throats. The Sorelians, national-syndicalists who follow the ideals of Georges Sorel, have begun orchestrating mass organised rallies. Their paramilitary, the Revolutionary Legion, march down the streets chanting loyalties to their leader, Georges Valois and demanding punishment for the degenerate bourgeois who they claim rule the Commune.\n\nEqually troublesome are the Jacobins, under the command of Maurice Thorez, a devout follower of the deceased Russian revolutionary, Vladimir Lenin. Declaring syndicalism to be an inferior system to their preferred communism, the Jacobins have become notorious for instigating strikes against unions associated with the Travailleurs. Not only do both these groups attack the government, but also each other. Street battles have become common, this chaotic situation must be dealt with one way or another..."

### Focuses ###

FRA_amenagement: "Aménagement du Territoire"
FRA_amenagement_desc: "Our territory is vast and inequally developed, some rural regions having been left behind while others prosper and grow at spectacular rates. We must encourage local initiatives and consider ambitious infrastructure projects to solve that problem on a local and national level."
FRA_hydroelectricity: "Hydroelectricity"
FRA_hydroelectricity_desc: "Our mountainous regions in the Alpes and the Massif Central have plenty of high flow rivers, a perfect environment to install a clean and lasting source of energy and revitalise the backwards, rural mountainous regions of the Commune."
FRA_swiss_hydroelectricity: "Swiss Hydroelectricity"
FRA_swiss_hydroelectricity_desc: "Our recent conquest of Romandie has opened up several perfect spots for hydroelectricity as an extension of our existing network in the Alpes. Our leading engineers are certain that expanding our dams in the region would be greatly beneficial to our economy."
FRA_chemins_de_fer: "Office des Chemins de Fer"
FRA_chemins_de_fer_desc: "A Congress meeting over the status of France's infrastructure at the BGT showed the disorganisation of our rail system and how backwards it became. The Congress agreed on the need to create a new office specifically tasked with the development and maintenance of our railways to connect all the parts of France together."
FRA_mining_expansion: "Mining Expansion"
FRA_mining_expansion_desc: "The economic and infrastructural development of the regions of the Alpes and the Massif Central allows for a greater exploitation of the mineral resources available there. Our prospectors discovered new mineral deposits and we are now ready to start exploiting them on an industrial scale!"
FRA_plan_prost: "Plan Prost"
FRA_plan_prost_desc: "The engineer and urbanist Henri Prost came up with a plan to develop highways around the Parisian region to link the outlying suburbs. This idea is receiving widespread support and the BGT decided to fund new projects to expand highways through the Commune. The communes of Marseille and Lyon also asked him to draw highway plans for their cities."
FRA_autoroutes: "The Autoroutes"
FRA_autoroutes_desc: "The highways proved a massive boon to the economy and worker mobility in urban regions, now an ambitious plan has been put forward to expand them to the whole country! Linking every corner of our country will have a massive impact on our regional development and can only benefit the Revolution."

FRA_eco_direction: "Direction of the Economy"
FRA_eco_direction_desc: "Our economy is fairer to the workers and generally quite potent while reactionary economies live and die on the whims of capitalists, but internal conflicts have prevented us from steering our economy. It is time to call for a meeting of the BGT, so that these questions are once and for all settled by one the Commune's faction."
FRA_orth_syndicalism: "Orthodox Syndicalism"
FRA_orth_syndicalism_desc: "The course set since the revolution has been reaffirmed. This orthodoxy has proven effective, and with a bit of fine-tuning can be even more so."
FRA_reduce_unemploy: "Reducing Unemployment"
FRA_reduce_unemploy_desc: "Beyond the Rhine, unemployment is at an all-time high, we must ensure that the French worker will always have a job to feed his family. In this simple task of providing our people with the fruit of their sustenance, we prove our inherent superiority to the capitalist economies and their constant crises."
FRA_work_design_coop: "Worker-Designer Cooperation"
FRA_work_design_coop_desc: "By increasing the cooperation between the scientists and engineers behind designs and concepts and the workers who actually build them, we will rapidly improve our production techniques. This also allows us to quickly train and educate our workforce to new techniques, by letting the designers directly teach the workers about them."
FRA_improve_manage: "Improve Management of Unions"
FRA_improve_manage_desc: "The Unions have for long been directing the economy, but they have some gaps and loopholes in their rules that can be exploited, leading to disastrous results for our economy. However, we will not question the place of the unions in our country. Instead, we will tighten management and rewrite some work codes."
FRA_dedication: "Sense of Dedication"
FRA_dedication_desc: "The worker has to realise that he is working for the greater good of the Commune and the French people as a whole. He must feel invested in his work at all times, and it is this way that we will improve our national spirit and our productivity. No need for whips or oppressive business owners."
FRA_fac_towns: "Factory Towns"
FRA_fac_towns_desc: "Our plan to rapidly expand the Commune's industrial base can be supported by the establishment of new factory towns, cities specially designed to provide housing and modern commodities to them and their families, while making sure they live close to their workplaces."
FRA_Industrialisation: "Communal Industrialisation"
FRA_Industrialisation_desc: "Jean Jérôme is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Jacobin, he is a proponent of Communal Industrialisation. While our country has always been one of the modern economies of Europe, we cannot yet compare to the Ruhr Valley. Only by ambitious industrial base expansion can we hope to measure to Germany."
FRA_inter_coop: "International Cooperation"
FRA_inter_coop_desc: "While our technical expertise is one of the best in the world, it is too easy to ignore any breakthroughs that are made in friendly countries on a false pretence of superiority. From new production techniques to management theories, we must stay observant and borrow anything that could benefit our own economy."
FRA_war_eco_agri: "War Economy and Agriculture"
FRA_war_eco_agri_desc: "Jacques Doriot is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Sorelian, he is a proponent of his 'War, Economy and Agriculture' theory, calling for a rapid conversion to a war economy along with an ambitious development of the agriculture. Should the German reactionaries attack, we will certainly have a use for the rifles and the bread."
FRA_modern_farms: "Modern Farms"
FRA_modern_farms_desc: "Farming has been a staple of civilisation since ancient times, and yet it has profoundly changed in just one century. Recent tools like tractors allow a single farmer to harvest fields in a single day that would have required dozens of farmers and a week in the past. Let's mechanise our farms, to put more food in our platters and our rations."
FRA_war_industry: "A War Industry"
FRA_war_industry_desc: "Despite rising animosity from Germany, our economy is still mostly dedicated to the production of civilian goods and is not suited for a major war. We need to develop our production of arms and equipment if we are to defend the Commune against external threats efficiently."
FRA_mass_production: "Mass Production"
FRA_mass_production_desc: "Our enemies are many, and our army is quite large as a result. This army needs a lot of equipment, and this clearly puts a strain on our factories. We must search new ways to improve our production of small arms through both design and manufacturing, without cutting corners."
FRA_cooperatives: "Cooperatives"
FRA_cooperatives_desc: "Daniel Guérin is the new economy minister of the Commune. An Anarchiste, he is a proponent of Cooperatives. The Commune's government is primarily here to serve its workers, and it must ensure the best working conditions for them. Letting them manage their own companies is a good way to start."
FRA_decentralized_industry: "Decentralised Industry"
FRA_decentralized_industry_desc: "Our industry is currently concentrated around Paris and major communes, but the people don't live only in Paris, Lille or Lyon but everywhere in France. We must put all efforts into developing all the regions of France so that our entire country prospers."
FRA_market_socialism: "Market Socialism"
FRA_market_socialism_desc: "The cooperatives we created must insert themselves in a new, equal socialist market. This market will make the economy more dynamic and allow everyone to pursue their own goals and share their industrial wealth in the respect of the ideals of socialism, without the predatory behaviours of the capitalist market economy."
FRA_ruralism: "Ruralism"
FRA_ruralism_desc: "The life of the peasant is the best life known to man, but the need for an industrial economy made this life impossible for most of the French people. We can, however, still encourage this lifestyle by bringing their factories and workplaces to the countryside, ending the tyranny of mass urbanisation."

FRA_communal_army: "The Communal Army"
FRA_communal_army_desc: "The French nation has an army, but it is an army that still does not have a unifying direction. Some still propose the same army of the Weltkrieg with High Command. Others want more initiative to NCOs. Others still desire a motorised and mobile army. Finally, there is also the idea of mass conscription. Once we dissolve the military trade unions, we must follow with an unified vision."
FRA_principe_concentration: "Principe de Concentration"
FRA_principe_concentration_desc: "As the butcher of the Weltkieg showed, there is nothing to be won with evenly spreading our troops across the entire front, taking only metres that we lose the next day to artillery barrages. By making local breakthroughs and investing into them, we can literally shatter the entire enemy front with a few good battles."
FRA_tank_research: "Tank Research Grants"
FRA_tank_research_desc: "Tanks are not new to us, nor to the world, but they are still a relatively new component of warfare. Improvements have been brisk in tank construction during the interwar, and it seems the true potential of armour is starting to reveal itself. Let us invest generously into the future of warfare."
FRA_fast_army: "Speed Cult"
FRA_fast_army_desc: "Motorisation is more than the future of cavalry. While the average truck will not last long under enemy fire, it allows us to get our troops to the very frontlines in incredible times. We must make speed the goal of all our tactics, all our training, all our equipment. Celerity is opportunity."
FRA_tank_assembly_line: "Tank Assembly Lines"
FRA_tank_assembly_line_desc: "Tanks are a fearsome machine on the battlefield, but they are a very complex machine to build. By creating baseline quality standards, we can speed up production of armour and supply our tanks with large armoured divisions that will come down on the enemy like a brick."
FRA_tank_quality_line: "Quality Production"
FRA_tank_quality_line_desc: "Tanks are a fearsome machine on the battlefield, but they are a very complex machine to build. Regardless, if we prioritise quality, we ensure that our tanks are the best of the best. Thus, every tank we produce will easily crush the tin cans that our enemy desperately output to counter us."
FRA_centralized_hc: "Centralised High Command"
FRA_centralized_hc_desc: "We are aware that the unsavoury events of 1919 have put a deep mistrust of military High Command in the people of the Commune. Regardless, we will need to rehabilitate the concept of the High Command. The idea of the squad leader deciding combat tactics is glamorous, but who will care for logistics and strategic manoeuvres?"
FRA_analysing_wki: "Analysing the Weltkrieg"
FRA_analysing_wki_desc: "The Weltkrieg, a tragedy to us and our British comrades, is a painful topic to study, but it is one we must study regardless. From the successes and failures of this war, we will learn how the next must be fought. Those who think that new tactics and strategies will sprout out of nowhere as the conflict draws near are deluded."
FRA_war_experience: "War Experience"
FRA_war_experience_desc: "The French army has fought many wars, and will fight many more. Every time we must stop and reflect on these conflicts, and make an analysis as thorough as possible to find where our plans have went right or wrong. Just because they did not fight under the Commune's flag does not mean they died in vain."
FRA_military_academy: "Military Academy"
FRA_military_academy_desc: "War is a complex topic, one that must be studied to be fully understood. While we have found many talents during the 1919 Civil War, we must take the preliminary steps to train new officers. We can also study our whole doctrine and renew the training of our officer corps this way."
FRA_officers_initiative: "Officer's Initiative"
FRA_officers_initiative_desc: "How often during the Weltkrieg have breakthroughs been made but not exploited due to unresponsive officers? We must ensure this does not happen again, every regiment should be able to act independently, drawing up plans and acting on them as they see fit. This is the reality of modern warfare, Napoleonic columns are history."
FRA_mission_type: "Mission Type Tactics"
FRA_mission_type_desc: "Our plans are not meant to be tasklists, else our troops are paralysed once the unexpected happens. Our plans must always be built with one specific goal in mind. This is the only rigid part of the plan, all else is left to squads to figure out. This way, we will always be ready to adapt our plans as the situation on the field develops."
FRA_flexible_support: "Flexible Support"
FRA_flexible_support_desc: "To ensure the efficiency of our squads, we must ensure they are served by artillery and support regiments in a flexible manner. This means that at any time artillery must be ready to fire on the orders of any squad linked to it, and support companies must be ready to intervene when called for help on the front."
FRA_empower_rifleman: "Empower the Rifleman"
FRA_empower_rifleman_desc: "Eventually, we can draft all the plans in the world and stack as many artillery guns in the backline as we see fit, but the humble Rifleman is the one who will win the war. By ensuring that even them can independently take initiative, we subtly improve the efficiency of every squad and defeat those enemies who use terror to lead them."
FRA_mass_conscription: "Mass Conscription"
FRA_mass_conscription_desc: "The Weltkrieg showed without a doubt that modern wars now take absolutely insane scales, drafting millions to fight on every side. Every Frenchman must know that one day, he may be called to defend his beloved country against the Reactionaries. We will only be defeated when the last of us perish!"
FRA_improve_manufactures: "Improve the Manufactures"
FRA_improve_manufactures_desc: "War truly has taken a massive scale, and such a modern war will need an amount of equipment that we perhaps cannot even fathom yet. To the rifle and grenade is added the tank and plane, soon perhaps more. We must ensure our military industry is the best it can possibly be, we will never have one too many rifles!"
FRA_global_organization: "Global Organisation"
FRA_global_organization_desc: "A grand army needs a grand command. However, it is not the High Command of old, sitting in a war room in Paris, drawing arrows on a map. It is the officers of every squad, of every regiment, of every army and of every front. All together, they will lead our army, and ensure our eventual victory in such a large conflict."
FRA_mass_fire_support: "Mass Fire Support"
FRA_mass_fire_support_desc: "With such a big army comes a new idea for the old concept of support fire. For long it was thought that artillery alone could support a push, but we believe that it is the duty of every squad that is not attacking to provide covering fires for those who push forward. This way, our enemies will forever duck as we move forwards."
FRA_grand_army_reform: "Grand Army Reform"
FRA_grand_army_reform_desc: "Our army is now united in purpose and in doctrine. No more does anyone dare call them a militia or street rabble. This brings back to the imagery of the Grande Armée, and indeed it is a legacy we are proud of. Let us ensure our whole army organisation is geared towards handling this many soldiers and officers."

FRA_equipment_modern: "Modern Equipment"
FRA_equipment_modern_desc: "The tools of war are ever improving, more efficient, more deadly. To some, this is a tragedy, but it is clear that we cannot shun them. War is an ugly reality, and we must face it. By ensuring our equipment is always the best, we make conflicts deadlier, perhaps. But our enemies will not spare us the courtesy of using those weapons on us."
FRA_special_forces: "Alpine Forces"
FRA_special_forces_desc: "Mountains have always been a radically different environment to fight in, and most of our borders cross mountains. We must ensure that our training of mountain forces is spotless, and that every new piece of equipment we invent is adapted to mountain warfare. Mountain artillery exists, perhaps mountain tanks soon will?"
FRA_tank_division: "Tank Divisions"
FRA_tank_division_desc: "It has been obvious for a while, but tanks are here to stay. Their armour is impenetrable to small arms fire, and their mighty cannon destroys whatever it is aimed at. As years go own, their designs become heavier and more destructive. We must stay on the forefront of tank technology, so that we may dominate the battlefield."
FRA_road_to_war: "The Road to War"
FRA_road_to_war_desc: "The war with Germany is clearly inevitable, this nation holds hostage our brothers in Alsace and Lorraine, and with its many puppets in the Reichspakt it stands as the main counter-revolutionary power in Europe, if not the world, tyrant over hundreds of millions of people. This will stop, we will avenge them all. The first Weltkrieg was not the last."
FRA_renseignements_generaux: "The Renseignements Généraux"
FRA_renseignements_generaux_desc: "It has become clearly obvious that we cannot defend our country in a satisfactory manner without a modern, centralised intelligence agency. The taboos of old still hold against such centralised, unscrutinised authority, but it is a sacrifice we have to make. German spies laugh softly at our pitiful 'intelligence committees'."
FRA_military_buildup: "Military Build-up"
FRA_military_buildup_desc: "To prepare for the upcoming war, we will need to develop our war industry rapidly and efficiently. This may damage our short term economic growth, and this may not be popular for those in our populace who hope for peace and prosperity, but we sadly know better. The survival of the Revolution is at stake here!"
FRA_military_buildup_two: "Calibrating the Economy"
FRA_military_buildup_two_desc: "The capitalist world is still struggling with last year's shattering economic crisis whilst the righteousness of our own system continues to prove itself. It has been suggested that we utilise this industrial advantage to transform certain aspects of the economy exclusively towards military purposes."
FRA_socialist_education: "Socialist Education"
FRA_socialist_education_desc: "The education of the French Republic was in many ways excellent, allowing the average citizen to obtain a large knowledge in the sciences and arts. We seek to continue working on this legacy by ensuring that French schools always have learning and education as their primary goal, not hierarchy and discipline like in some reactionary countries."
FRA_Our_time_has_come: "Revanchist Propaganda"
FRA_Our_time_has_come_desc: "Our desire of revenge against Germany has been long coming. 1871 saw us lose Alsace-Lorraine, and the Republican schools rightfully taught their children that it was a French region soon to be seized back. Sadly, 1919 saw our defeat and the loss of Nancy. But we are not done, our rightful anger shall only end when France is whole again!"
FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals: "Department of Revolutionary Ideals"
FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals_desc: "While the empirical teachings prove themselves easily, the virtues of the Commune are harder to communicate to our population. While ominous sounding, we must create an institution ready to help us remind to our people the value of the Revolution and prevent reactionary influences from implanting themselves."
FRA_Blanqui_Research_Institute: "Blanqui Research Institute"
FRA_Blanqui_Research_Institute_desc: "While some nations resist the teachings of science, France endorses them without nuance. Let's support the establishment of a new research institute aimed at furthering our technological superiority. Where reactionaries doubt every discovery and stand wary of change, we embrace them and become stronger every year!"
FRA_military_buildup_three: "Further Military Development"
FRA_military_buildup_three_desc: "Our economy is now well developed and the Commune is ready for war, but we can always do better. By encouraging further industrial projects, the Commune shall not only be ready for war but will indisputably be superior in every way to any of our enemies. We will prove to the world that the Commune will not be defeated!"
FRA_military_science: "Military Science"
FRA_military_science_desc: "France is always working on improving its research networks, but theoretical sciences can only bring us so far. We will open a new wing in the Blanqui research institute dedicated to military science, allowing us to fund and develop new breakthroughs that will be immediately put to use by our army."
FRA_synthetic_refineries: "Synthetic Resources"
FRA_synthetic_refineries_desc: "France is great and resourceful, but it does not have everything. Oil, rubber, tungsten and chromium all lack, and we may not always rely on foreign exporters when conflict comes. We must research news ways to acquire these resources from what we already have. Some scientists even suggest we may be able to engineer those resources."
FRA_secret_weaponry: "Electric Machines"
FRA_secret_weaponry_desc: "While computing traces back to the tabulating machine, we have since made massive breakthroughs in the field of computing. Our mathematicians already assure use that those new machines are of a tremendous help for rapid and efficient calculus. Given some patronage and time, we can only imagine the possibilities of this new field."
FRA_damocles: "The Damocles Project"
FRA_damocles_desc: "Inspired by the Cambridge Conference during the Second Internationale Congress, a reunion took place today at the University of Cambridge. A group of theoretical physicists from Britain and France are requesting funding for the establishment of the 'Damocles Project', a joint British-French committee for nuclear research."
FRA_nuclear_weapons: "Curie Project"
FRA_nuclear_weapons_desc: "While the Damocles Project held great promise, the refusal by the Union of Britain to take part crippled the cooperation between our scientists and theirs. Regardless, we must persevere and try to figure out what uses we can make of the atom. We will dedicate this project to the very woman who discovered Radium and set us on this path."
FRA_German_borders: "Fortify the German Border"
FRA_German_borders_desc: "We have already built a fairly impressive network of fortifications along the Meuse river and the border with Flanders-Wallonia. Regardless, we can improve it with new constructions and cutting-edge military installations like radio stations and modern artillery guns. Something the Republic would have never bothered to do, surely."
FRA_extend_line: "Extend the Line"
FRA_extend_line_desc: "While we have mostly focused our fortification efforts on those segments of the line that are the most defensible, it is quite obvious that Germany will target our weaker points instead. The solution is quite simple, we will not have weakpoints. Least they learn how to walk on water, good luck for them to cross this line!"
FRA_Demand_Romandy: "Demand Haute-Savoie"
FRA_Demand_Romandy_desc: "The illegal Swiss occupation of Haute-Savoie has gone on for far too long! The Swiss have shown themselves brutish tyrants and oppressors of our people on our own rightful land! No-one can have the audacity to persecute and hunt down Frenchmen and think they may get away with it, the perfidious Swiss have made their last mistake."
FRA_Demand_Alsace_Lorraine: "Demand Alsace-Lorraine"
FRA_Demand_Alsace_Lorraine_desc: "The French people shall wait no longer! The time has finally come for Germany to return the whole of Alsace-Lorraine or face the ultimate consequences! And should they refuse, we will bring unto them a war of a brutality and fierceness that will send their pawns running straight back to Berlin! We will avenge our fallen brothers!"
FRA_war_with_spain: "Liberate Iberia"
FRA_war_with_spain_desc: "Right at our southern border, just across the Pyrenees, capitalism and imperialism still persists. With our efforts, we will achieve what no french imperialist could - total control of Iberia. But we are different. We do it for the common people, not imperial ambitions. Syndicalism will succeed in Iberia!"
FRA_War_with_germany: "Take Down Germany"
FRA_War_with_germany_desc: "Much to our surprise, the German reactionaries have ceded Alsace-Lorraine. But we never intended to just stop there! The Revolution shall prevail, our brothers will be avenged for what they have been put through in the Weltkrieg! They will just wish they had lost the first war, for we will stop at nothing until they are utterly destroyed!"
FRA_peace_with_germany: "Peaceful Coexistence"
FRA_peace_with_germany_desc: "Much to our surprise, the German reactionaries have ceded Alsace-Lorraine. With this being the case, many have called for us to end hostilies against the Reich. After all, if they handed us back our rightful lands, who's to say we can't get along? "
FRA_War_with_austria: "Turn the Danube Red"
FRA_War_with_austria_desc: "The Austrian peoples have proven their incapability to commence a successful socialist revolution in their country and liberate themselves from the Habsburg tyranny. We shall assist them, then. Likewise, all the peoples still under the tyranny of this anachronistic empire will be freed. Europe will be free of the last of the reactionary empires."
FRA_War_with_Netherlands: "Around Ludendorff"
FRA_War_with_Netherlands_desc: "Lowlands of Benelux are strategically vital to our war efforts. The Germans will not expect the attack from this side and if we succeed, we will cut Germany off from it's vital economic areas in the Rhineland. Germany will fall."
FRA_World_revolution: "World Revolution"
FRA_World_revolution_desc: "With the Revolution now well established in Europe, we can start to look outwards and launch a formidable plan to liberate the whole world from the reactionaries and imperialists. Our struggle will end once the last of them is tried before the people for their crimes. Vive la République Socialiste Mondiale!"
FRA_european_revolution: "European Revolution"
FRA_european_revolution_desc: "While the idea of a World Revolution is noble, we have to stay realistic. With smart influence and no other reactionary power to oppose us, we shall soon see the other continents convert to Syndicalism. However, we must ensure that Europe is free of reactionaries. Vive la République Socialiste Européene!"
FRA_peaceful_revolution: "Peaceful Revolution"
FRA_peaceful_revolution_desc: "We hear those who claim that the Revolution cannot end, and it will not. However, we cannot afford to constantly wage war in all corners of the world without cause. The workers will find their way as we act as a beacon of desires. Let us focus on ourselves instead. Vive la République Socialiste Française!"
FRA_red_union: "Union of Solidarity"
FRA_red_union_desc: ""

FRA_Host_the_Internationale: "The Internationale Congress"
FRA_Host_the_Internationale_desc: "Heads of Socialist, Syndicalist, and Totalist parties, Heads of State and Governments, Foreign Ministers and journalists have all arrived in Paris for the opening of the First Congress of the Third Internationale. We are first to host the Congress and humbly hope to use it to establish ourselves as the leading socialist country in the world."
FRA_mission_bhartiya: "Mission to the Bharatiya Commune"
FRA_mission_bhartiya_desc: "The Bharatiya Commune asked for our support in their struggle against its neighbours, the Delhi imperialists and the Princely Federation reactionaries. They ask of us that we send military advisers to train their officers and their troops. We will ensure this aid arrives rapidly, so that they may unite India faster."
FRA_arab_committee: "Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee"
FRA_arab_committee_desc: "The traitors of the French people, bastard Petain and his clique of friends, use the native proletariat in efforts to return to the mainland. We won't give them such a chance. Our comrade Sail Mohamed proposed to us the idea of supporting socialist liberation movements across all of Africa, for the good of all Arabs."
FRA_working_women: "Working Women"
FRA_working_women_desc: "During the Congress, Helen Crawfurd took the stage with her flaming speech about the women's role in the World Revolution. We supported her arguments and now we are ready to implement common sense reforms regarding the status of working women in our society. The reactionaries can gawk, we will surely have the last laugh."
FRA_avantgarde: "International Avant-Garde"
FRA_avantgarde_desc: "For too long have traditional arts and classical music dominated the entertainment of the masses. While Jazz is enjoyable and widely popular in our countries, one genre cannot fight against all others. We have to create new ones, we have to show the world, what the real entertainment is. And it will show to the world that we are the good force of this era!"
FRA_help_cnt: "Support the CNT"
FRA_help_cnt_desc: "Our comrades of the CNT are fighting against the Carlist and Bourbon reactionaries to liberate the whole of Spain, and probably soon the whole Iberian Peninsula, as we speak. We have made a promise to help them in their cause, and we will without doubt make good on it. And no later than now."
FRA_second_inter_congress: "The Second Internationale Congress"
FRA_second_inter_congress_desc: "With the Second American Civil War raging on, as well as a number of other conflicts ready to break out at any time across the world, the Internationale has to consider its approach towards the Global Revolution. Since the first Congress of the Internationale took place in France, the second one will take place in Britain."
FRA_scientific_cooperation: "International Scientific Cooperation"
FRA_scientific_cooperation_desc: "It is clear that we cannot simply keep our own technological discoveries to ourselves. During a meeting at the old university of Cambridge, we decided to establish a worldwide plan to combine the technological advances of Socialist countries. Some however, call for a more ambitious plan, including industrial investment."
FRA_third_inter_congress: "The Victory Congress"
FRA_third_inter_congress_desc: "The responsibility of holding the Third Congress has once again fallen back to us, with the new site chosen for the task being the Palace Populaire, where the Louvre once stood full of the plunders of the French Empire. Fittingly, one of the topics at hand concerns finally liberating the African continent."
FRA_end_GEX: "The End of the Kaiser"
FRA_end_GEX_desc: "Africa has long suffered under tyranny and oppression. The oppression of its many kings, the oppression of slave traders and missionaries, and finally the oppression of European colonists and explorers. Finally, we give freedom to Africa, and hope that one day we can right the wrongs done to them."

FRA_armee_de_lair: "Armée de l'Air du Peuple"
FRA_armee_de_lair_desc: "Planes are a strange new aspect of warfare. These machines are quite complex to handle, and the punishment for failing to fly properly obvious. And yet, any able man can be a pilot. We must open the ranks of the air force to the conscripts, like the army and navy has. Our air force will have no shortage of pilots."
FRA_amateur_pilots: "Amateur Pilots"
FRA_amateur_pilots_desc: "No-one is born a pilot, and while some study to excel at air handling and combat and their efforts are admirable, we cannot expect every single pilot to be an ace. We must give civilian pilots and amateur pilots their chance to shine. This also includes women, who would normally not be conscripted."
FRA_st_exp_doctrine: "St-Exupéry Doctrine"
FRA_st_exp_doctrine_desc: "Antoine de Saint-Exupéry is a brilliant aviator, and he has much to teach us about this new, strange world of air warfare. While his words are no gospel, we heavily value his unique experience and aim to make his teachings the frame of future air doctrine. A start, certainly."
FRA_ecole_air: "Ecole de l'Air"
FRA_ecole_air_desc: "As our air doctrine rapidly expands and air fights go from disorganised brawls to carefully crafted engagements, we desperately begin to need trained pilots and trained officers who can plan air campaigns as they plan land or naval campaigns. Only our wits will work in this brand new field of warfare, and luckily we have some."
FRA_air_bases: "Establish More Air Bases"
FRA_air_bases_desc: "Planes require air bases to land, refuel, rearm, repair and take off, much like navies. But unlike navies, they cannot stay airborne for months, only hours. As such, we must ensure our air base coverage is excellent, and we must make sure we are always under capacity so that our air force is never crippled by lacking infrastructure."
FRA_fighters: "Fighter Focus"
FRA_fighters_desc: "The air is a new, vast angle of attack for our enemies, and as such it is a new angle of defence for us. Unlike on land, there are no forts, no cover, just one-on-one dogfights. If we invest in fighter production, we ensure no-one will freely navigate our air. Our fighters will always be upon them and ready to bring them back to the ground."
FRA_bombers: "Bomber Focus"
FRA_bombers_desc: "The air is a new, vast angle of attack for us, and it is one our enemies might not defend adequately against yet. Bombs present a single yet elegant way of transporting ordnance from the hangar to the target. We must invest in bombers to ensure that our enemies are assaulted from all sides, an advantage we cannot ignore."
FRA_strat_bombers: "Strategic Destruction Focus"
FRA_strat_bombers_desc: "If one bomb works well against an enemy, then ten bombs must only work better. Further development in bomber models have unveiled new air frames capable of carrying massive amounts of bombs, or a few devastatingly big bombs. Whatever the case, we may soon flatten entire cities or armies with a few waves of air attacks."
FRA_paratroopers: "Paratroopers Development"
FRA_paratroopers_desc: "Until now, we have always considered that the only way to transport troops are trucks and landing craft. However, recent breakthroughs in aviation means we now have planes capable of carrying entire squads, and dropping them into battle in a safe manner. We must immediately train regiments capable of this vertical encirclement!"
FRA_rocket_development: "Rocketry Effort"
FRA_rocket_development_desc: "The rocket engine is the pinnacle of our research in new propulsion methods for aircraft. While the path to creating rocket craft might still be long and arduous, our scientists propose a simpler use for rockets. By strapping an explosive charge and flinging them at the enemy, we can bomb them from afar. Simple, devastating."

FRA_navy_focus: "Naval Reorganisation Programme"
FRA_navy_focus_desc: "While we currently have an acceptable navy, it is quite disorganised, preventing us from expanding it any further. We must integrate our naval forces back into the hierarchy of the Communal Forces. Just because we do not have a grand navy yet, does not mean we do not have a navy."
FRA_arsenaux_back_on: "Put the Arsenaux Back On"
FRA_arsenaux_back_on_desc: "The naval dockyards have for long been silent, abandoned in favour of military factories and civilian needs. Today, we will reinvest into those old Arsenaux, staff them again, and fund them so that we might once again have a navy that compares with the one of the Republic."
FRA_old_doctrine: "The Old Doctrine"
FRA_old_doctrine_desc: "Our navy is one grand ensemble, slowly navigating the seas, ready to lay waste to the navies of our enemies. They protect our convoys and fight off marauders, but stand ready to face off any large fleet with the full might of the entire French navy. Why change what is not broken?"
FRA_new_doctrine: "The New Doctrine"
FRA_new_doctrine_desc: "Our navy is a tool, to be applied carefully when the situation calls for it. Instead of falling for the enemy's bait and joining into those massive open-seas scrapyards, we must seek to strike their convoys, their isolated fleets, and keep them on the run while we rapidly destroy their entire economy."
FRA_muselier_plan: "The Muselier Plan"
FRA_muselier_plan_desc: "The Muselier Plan aims for us to continue improving the core of our navy. Battleships and cruisers will be the striking force of our grand navy, allowing us to end any fight with the rout of our enemy, with little damage to us except for screen ships such as Destroyers."
FRA_home_fleet: "Home Fleet"
FRA_home_fleet_desc: "Our fleet defends our coasts, patrolling the Channel, the Atlantic Coast and the Mediterranean tirelessly, ensuring that not a single submarine or roaming ship passes and damages our convoys or tries to shell our coasts or our moored ships. We do not fear an attack from the seas, from anyone."
FRA_strike_nat_france: "Strike the Regime in Algiers!"
FRA_strike_nat_france_desc: "The old Regime still lives in Algiers, subsisting from its exploitation of the African colonies of the defunct French Empire, corrupting our legacy with their atrocities. We must secure the Mediterranean, and they stand in our way. We will put an end to this masquerade."
FRA_waves_of_syndicalism: "The Waves of Syndicalism"
FRA_waves_of_syndicalism_desc: "Syndicalism will reach to all the seas of the world. We may not have the ports or colonies of the old, reactionary Empires, but we have the will to send our ship on long voyages, bringing back tales of victory over the imperialists. Our sailors will sail the seven seas in the name of Syndicalism!"
FRA_colonnes_neptune: "The Colonnes de Neptune"
FRA_colonnes_neptune_desc: "If we are to defeat enemy nations abroad, a beachhead is a necessary step before we can deploy the brunt of our forces. We must train our Marines forces with purpose and ensure that only the best partake in those incredibly arduous tasks. The fate of entire invasions count on them alone."
FRA_submarines: "Guerre Sous-Marine"
FRA_submarines_desc: "As modern war takes to the air, it also goes under the seas. Submarines provide a new, revolutionary change to naval warfare. Their torpedoes can end even the most armoured of battleships, and their profile is stealthy, with only the most advanced technologies able to find and attack them."
FRA_cut_off_capitalists: "Cut off the Capitalists"
FRA_cut_off_capitalists_desc: "We cannot simply sit and watch as the Empires of old extort the peoples of the world and bring their blunder back to their colonial offices to count and enjoy. We will ensure that every convoy hauling their unjustly seized goods fears the Communal submarine."
FRA_naval_bombers: "Develop Naval Bombers"
FRA_naval_bombers_desc: "The air can well pair with the sea. Planes carrying torpedoes allow us to instantly kill even the biggest of ships with great accuracy, the torpedoes preventing us from having to hit dead centre on a ship's deck with a bomb. We must invest in naval bombers to gain an edge on big, bulky navies."
FRA_protect_coastlines: "Protect our Coastlines"
FRA_protect_coastlines_desc: "Eventually, our navy cannot protect every single beach and every single small harbour in our country. However, we can plan ahead and add some basic fortifications to ensure we are not taken by surprise. If they land on our beaches, they will enjoy cold hard steel after a long time at sea."

FRA_Phalanstere_internationale: "Found the Phalanstère International"
FRA_Phalanstere_internationale_desc: "The need for secrecy necessitates certain inefficiencies in military research. By working closely with other syndicalist nations and allowing researchers access to others' most closely guarded secrets, this fundamental issue can be overcome. The Phalanstère International shall serve as the central authority for the exchange of such secrets."

FRA_revolutionary_legion: "Incorporate the Revolutionary Legion"
FRA_revolutionary_legion_desc: "The L'Armée Populaire de la Commune de France is full of anarchists who cannot be trusted, we must purge the military hierarchy and integrate our own loyal legionary camrades. Commander Bucard and Field Marshal Doriot have informed us that revolutionary legionnaires have already 'dealt' with disloyal generals, now is the perfect time to launch a full take over."
FRA_centralise_the_state: "Centralize the State"
FRA_centralise_the_state_desc: "The bureaucracy and autonomous decision making of the Commune must go. The nation is the state and therefore the state must be in full control of the nation, in order to fully enforce the ideals of Sorelians the state must centralise all government areas along with abolishing autonomous communes."
FRA_sorelian_industry: "Complete Industrialisation"
FRA_sorelian_industry_desc: "Nothing short of complete industrialisation shall satisfy the needs of the new commune, it is of the upmost importance that the factories of France fill the sky of smoke. A new dawn awaits and the embers of steel and strength shall greet it."
FRA_anti_german_focus: "Anti-German Revanchism"
FRA_anti_german_focus_desc: "The despicable imperialists across the border have humiliated France for the last time, the German people are a threat to global peace and this is proven no greater than the tyrannical rule over Alsace-Lorraine. If the French people are to arise from the ashes of the failed republic they must confront their nemesis to the east."
FRA_abolish_anarcho_unions: "Enforce Union Loyalty"
FRA_abolish_anarcho_unions_desc: "The unions are the backbone of the revolution however with many expressing dissenting opinions and breeding political opposition the new regime must enforce total loyalty. All unions must declare an oath to Chairman Valois!"
FRA_corporate_syndicalism: "Corporate Syndicalism"
FRA_corporate_syndicalism_desc: "Syndicalism has modernised the nation however the representation of the workers has not fully been satisfied, therefore we shall incorporate elements of corporatism into the union structure. Workers will be represented depending on their speciality and strengths, and in return the government will be in direct control of the workers."
FRA_modern_army: "A Modern Army for a Modern World"
FRA_modern_army_desc: "Respected general and minister of the economy, Jacques Doriot, has provided Chairman Valois with a detailed plan to reorganise the military into a modernised unified fighting force commanded by a hierarchical structure loyal to the Chairman. Under his direction the military might of France will be pushed to its full potential."
FRA_revolutionary_nationalism: "Revolutionary Nationalism"
FRA_revolutionary_nationalism_desc: "French nationalism emerged from the first revolution when the peasantry rose up against the elites charged with the traitorous crime of ignoring the needs of the nation. The Sorelians have been handed the torch of nationalism and through our propaganda campaigns we will promote these ideals to the populace."
FRA_valois_is_gone: "Day of Infamy"
FRA_valois_is_gone_desc: "Our dear leader, Chairman Valois, shall deliver a grand speech to be broadcasted to the entire nation. His wise words and storng actions will resonate with the working patriots of France and strike a clear message to foes inside and outside France. The Sorelians are in charge, nothing can stop the new regime from achieving its goals. Whatever could go wrong..."

FRA_nazbols_win_desc: "After the assassination of Georges Valois and the conclusion of the interim Sorelian Council, a recovering Marcel Déat has taken over as the leader of the Sorellians and is shifting the party towards more totalitarian views in an attempt to centralize power within the country, these actions he claims we help protect the true values of Sorel and Valois"
FRA_the_great_purge: "The Great Purge"
FRA_the_great_purge_desc: "Déat believes that even people within the party cannot be trusted as they have disagreed with his ideas. This disloyal behaviour cannot be tolerated anymore, now is the most opportune time to purge the opposition and gain further power within the party."
FRA_merge_all_trade_unions: "One Loyal Trade Union"
FRA_merge_all_trade_unions_desc: "The trade unions have been loyal to us so far, however with rising amounts of paranoia coming from Déat the unions have been slowly trying to make themselves more distanced from the party. This is not acceptable and must be eliminated at once. And from the ashes of the unions, we shall craft a singular union that will be forever loyal to the party."
FRA_agricultural_collectivisation: "Agricultural Collectivization"
FRA_agricultural_collectivisation_desc: "“From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs”.

FRA_replace_industrial_leaders: "Replace Industrial Leaders"
FRA_replace_industrial_leaders_desc: "The industrial leaders of the state haven’t been getting the results we expected.

FRA_establish_secret_police_desc: "The Commissariat du Peuple aux Affaires intérieures or The People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs was established to help suppress rebels and dissidents all across the country, however for the most part its mission is to make sure the french people stay loyal to the syndicalist cause."

FRA_destory_reactionary_thought_desc: "The people agree that the state has made significant progress in improving the state of living so much as to overshadow the former government’s attempts. However despite the progress made some public dissidents are actively trying to form militias to overthrow the current government. We must deploy some garrison troops in the countryside to make sure that no opposition movement gains traction."
FRA_reeducation_camps: "Re-Education Camps"

FRA_superior_french_culture_desc: "The French have always been the front runners of syndicalist culture and ideals, some might say the best of the best.

### Events ###

comfrance.1.t: "The Commune of France"
comfrance.1.d: "The Third Republic ended the way it began: defeated by German arms and facing communist revolution at home. In the November of 1919, a revolutionary General Strike was called by the CGT, paralysing the country and causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. 'The Party of Order' was not strong enough to put an end to the unrest and in subsequent months the French Establishment was forced out of France by a coalition of leftist forces in a brief but brutal civil war.\n\nFor the past fifteen years, the self-styled 'Commune of France' has united behind a common platform of Syndicalist-Socialist consensus, headed by the ruling Comité de Salut Public. However, by 1936, the consensus that was reached in order to rebuild the shattered country and defend the fruits of revolution from foreign menace is being deemed as increasingly outdated by many critics, and there are growing calls for more radical policies. France is increasingly confident in her security and in her mission, but the French revolutionary tradition is disparate, and it is unclear precisely which ideological strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."
comfrance.1.a: "Aux armes, citoyens!"

comfrance.5.t: "The Fall of Marceau Pivert"
comfrance.5.d: "Despite the successful organisation of the Syndicalist Congress in May, the Pivert administration has been criticised for its lack of response to the crackdown on trade unions in Germany. Today, the opposition in the Bourse Générale du Travail has agreed to a vote of no confidence in Pivert, who has announced that new elections will be brought forward to elect a new Comité. His duties will be temporarily assumed by the Comité de Salut Public until the last results come in."
comfrance.5.a: "Goodbye, Camarade Pivert."

comfrance.6.t: "Election Day 1: Clarifying the Communal Army"
comfrance.6.d: "Due to the presence of trade unions within the Communard Army, it has become overly politicised, creating tensions within the Guarantor of National Integrity and the Arm of the Syndicalist Revolution! This has resulted in the incumbent Chief of Staff, the popular civil war general Maurice Gamelin, having to step down. The French Syndicalist military leaders, mostly Sorelians, have decided to ask the soldiers who they wish to lead the French army, before definitely dissolving the military trade unions."

comfrance.7.d: "Due to its key purpose over external and internal security matters, the position of Director of the Comité de Renseignements Généraux is recognised as one of the keys to supreme power in the Commune of France, and is crucial for the destruction of political rivals. It could be a terrible weapon in the hands of one of the extremist factions, Jacobins and Sorelians..."

The Travailleurs are now looking towards the Russian émigré Boris Souvarine, who unlike Pivert, is seen as both strong enough to keep the radical factions in line and capable of leading the Commune to its final glory!"

The streets will be painted red with the blood of our foes whilst the workers of the world can at last rejoice, Leninism is not dead!''

The old man accepted with reluctance, thus consecrating the Jacobin complete takeover of the Commune. Outspoken Leninist, Maurice Thorez was eventually elected through the support of newly elected Jacobin Chairman of the Comité de Salut Public."
comfrance.14.a: "Vive la Revolution!"

comfrance.15.t: "The Results: Sorelian Majority"
comfrance.15.d: "The elections finally gave power to the national-syndicalist faction of the Commune of France, staunch followers of the revolutionary theories of Georges Sorel, and eventually destroying their old Jacobin foes, who are now victims of a bloody purge throughout the country. Georges Valois has replaced Faure as the Chairman of the BGT.

comfrance.16.d: "Immediately after winning the elections the Sorelians under the leadership of Chairman Valois have begun their new National-Syndicalist plan for France. The past weeks have seen dissenting opposition crushed and prominent non-Sorelians dearly gripping onto power post-election isolated or found dead under suspicious circumstances. Valois has ordered that all references to Faure’s chairmanship are to be heavily criticised by the new regime whilst the man himself has been put under house arrest under fears that he may rally the Travailleurs and Anarchistes against Valois. France has once again undergone a radical transformation..."

comfrance.10800.t: "British Aid Arrives"
comfrance.10800.d: "The aid Britain promised to us has finally arrived. It is a shipment of rifles, not the most modern or effective models, but we can use them well all the same."
comfrance.10800.a: "We will put these to good use."

comfrance.109.t: "The French Agreed to Help!"
comfrance.109.d: "Our Communard brothers in France have decided to accept our request for support and have promised to sent shipments soon. It will not be long now until their aid arrives."

comfrance.110.d: "With all important decisions made during the first week, the Congress has moved on to less pressing matters. After ten days of negotiations, discussion, and politicking, the delegates came up with one final act - a declaration of eternal brotherhood and readiness to face the imperialists, wherever they are to be found."

comfrance.113.d: "With the Second International Congress in London under way, our delegation has been in preliminary talks with the Bolivians about the potential for an alliance to help entrench Socialism in South America. The question now is whether we should propose a formal alliance between our nations to help fight Argentina."

comfrance.113.b: "This is not required."

comfrance.114.t: "A Brazil-Bolivia Alliance?"

comfrance.116.d: "Philip Snowden, aged 73, passed away in his house in Tilford, Surrey. Although he resigned from the Chairman's post almost a year ago, his authority and influence in the Union were unprecedented. During his funeral, the Chairman of the TUC stated that 'Comrade Snowden has left us - but his ideas shall live on, forever.' The ceremony has turned out to be one of the greatest public manifestations of patriotism since the revolution of 1925."
comfrance.116.a: "Sic transit gloria mundi..."

comfrance.117.t: "The Death of Philip Snowden"
comfrance.117.d: "Philip Snowden, aged 73, passed away in his house in Tilford, Surrey. The traitor and the Chairman of the Union of Britain's TUC, Snowden has been remembered among the Royalists as a synonym for treachery. Although the Socialists in Britain mourn his death, in Canada his funeral has become a single bright day in this dark period of history."
comfrance.117.a: "The devil is dead."

comfrance.118.t: "Germany and the Second Congress of the Internationale"
comfrance.118.d: "The Congress has been received with anxiety in Germany. With the economic crisis still not completely solved, every increase in Socialist activity is a threat to the Reichspakt and the German Empire. In his latest speech, the Kaiser has condemned the Socialists, but words are not enough - action should be taken as well."
comfrance.118.a: "We will have to react somehow..."
comfrance.118.b: "Approach our neighbours."
comfrance.118.c: "Round up some left-wing agitators to calm the people down."

comfrance.119.t: "Germany Proposes a Reinsurance Treaty"
comfrance.119.d: "With socialist revival in the West evident, the Kaiser has decided to propose another Reinsurance Treaty with us, similar to the pre-Weltkrieg 1887 agreement that bound our nations together. According to the document, we would be obliged to aid the Kaiser, should Germany be attacked by the Commune of France, and vice versa. This is an excellent chance to break our international isolation, as well as secure our western flank until our army is rebuilt."
comfrance.119.a: "A good idea!"
comfrance.119.b: "Why should we help the Reich?"

comfrance.120.t: "Second Reinsurance Treaty Signed"
comfrance.120.d: "The Russians have accepted our proposition. In case of a war with Communard France, they are obliged to come to our aid, and so are we in an analogical situation."
comfrance.120.a: "Sehr gut."

comfrance.121.t: "Second Reinsurance Treaty Rejected"
comfrance.121.d: "The Russians have rejected our proposition. Although their army is weak and it is unlikely a war will break out between our states, we still have our back exposed in case of a war with France."
comfrance.121.a: "Scheiße!"

comfrance.122.t: "The Kaiser Promises Protection"
comfrance.122.d: "The Kaiser has promised to help our country, should the Internationale attempt to topple our government. This is a very good step in establishing a counterbalance for an increasingly-hostile international Socialism."
comfrance.122.a: "Sehr gut, as they say."

comfrance.123.t: "Germany Arrests Leftist Activists"
comfrance.123.d: "The Kaiser has initiated yet another campaign to purge Germany of left-wing sympathisers. Although this is a clear sign of panic from his side, the Internationale will surely suffer from the loss of such brave men."
comfrance.123.a: "We shall not forget this..."

comfrance.124.t: "French Aid Arrives!"
comfrance.124.d: "Our French Comrades have seen the plight of the Spanish workers, and have sent us considerable shipments of supplies! Many volunteers have also arrived, who are filling to fight for the cause of international proletarian solidarity!"
comfrance.124.a: "Great!"

comfrance.12600.t: "French Aid Arrives!"
comfrance.12600.d: "The help promised by our French comrades finally arrived at the airport of Santiago today, and tons of equipment, machines and construction materials are awaiting our decision, what should we do with them?"
comfrance.12600.a: "Use it to improve our army."
comfrance.12600.b: "Use it to improve our industry."
comfrance.12600.c: "Use it to fortify our border with Argentina."

comfrance.127.t: "The Phalanstère International Research Organisation"
comfrance.127.d: "As time has passed it has quickly become apparent that the global revolution requires far more than just devotion to the cause. With France and Britain being the only highly-developed socialist countries in the world, it has become widely accepted that they should launch a long-term research aid programme for other countries. And thus has begun the so-called 'Phalanstère International Research Organisation', a branch of the 'Phalanstère International' programme aimed at providing technological support for socialist countries all over the world. The question now is whether we should join in with this endeavour."
comfrance.127.a: "Participation sounds good."

comfrance.128.t: "The Phalanstère International Industrial Programme"
comfrance.128.d: "It has become apparent to many in the Internationale that it is the responsibility of all sufficiently-developed syndicalist nations to provide industrial support to those nations that are less able to provide for themselves. The choice is now upon us to decide whether we should stand in solidarity with workers around the world by helping implement a massive programme of industrial aid alongside our French brothers-in-arms."
comfrance.128.a: "It sounds like a great idea!"

comfrance.129.t: "The Phalanstère's Assistance Arrives"
comfrance.129.d: "As part of the Phalanstère Intertional programme, our comrades in Paris and London have just delivered us a much needed help. Industrial machines, mining equipment, weapons, ammunition and more - all of this is being unloaded in our ports and airports and being transported across the country."
comfrance.129.a: "Excellent!"

comfrance.130.t: "A Jacobin Reformation?"
comfrance.130.d: "Having at long last taken control of the Commune, the Jacobin led Comité de Salut Public is in the position to begin a complete conversion of the governmental system from failing Syndicalism to glorious Leninism. Hardline comrades are demanding that the Syndicalist structures be completely abolished, all replaced by the Parti Communiste Français in a Bolshevik-Leninist state. However despite Chairman Thorez's support for this initiative, this is likely to viciously divide France and as such many more moderate party officials are suggesting that the Jacobins continue to operate within the established Syndicalist structures of the BGT and CSP while gradually reforming the state along 'true' Marxist lines. Whatever the outcome is it shall surely cause more division"
comfrance.130.a: "Moderates are just Social-Reactionaries! Let us build a new system!"
comfrance.130.b: "Syndicalism shall be reformed, gradually the citizens of France will see the light of Leninism!"

comfrance.131.t: "Restructuring of the BGT and CSP"
comfrance.131.d: "The Syndicalist structures of post-revolution France are being transformed so as to better comply with true Marxism as laid out by the Parti Communiste Français. The Bourse Générale du Travail has been reformed as the Congrès des Députés du Peuple while the Comité de Salut Public has been replaced by the Conseil des Commissaires du Peuple."
comfrance.131.a: "An improvement, no doubt."

comfrance.132.t: "Dissolution of the CGT"
comfrance.132.d: "Now we turn on the last pillar of Syndicalism in France, the Confederation General du Travail - the dominant Syndicate which long kept us from taking power in the Commune. We can finally break their power, so as to prevent our rival from further resisting our Communist doctrine."
comfrance.132.a: "They are against our Revolution."

comfrance.133.t: "Reports of Military Unrest"
comfrance.133.d: "Our recent reforms, while making grand strides in setting France on the true path of Socialism, have upset many in French society. Now there are reports reaching the ears of the Comité de Renseignements Généraux that there are murmurs of dissent even within the Guarantor of National Integrity..."
comfrance.133.a: "Keep a close eye..."

comfrance.134.t: "Léon Blum and the Front Populaire"
comfrance.134.d: "Leading Travailleur figure, Léon Blum, along with respected war hero Maurice Gamelin, have begun to call openly for the disparate political factions of France to unite in opposition to the Jacobin government which many view as having corrupted and betrayed the Revolution. This Popular Front, despite being resisted by the many state mechanisms of the Jacobins, has already conducted several major industrial actions and political rallies in the larger cities.\n\nFearful that this open challenge to the party's rule might lead to a direct contest for the leadership of the Commune, the Renseignements Généraux is recommending that the Conseil des Commissaires arrest Blum and the other leaders linked to the Front - most prominently, other than Blum himself, the still-respected general Maurice Gamelin."
comfrance.134.a: "Bring them to trial!"
comfrance.134.b: "Leninist valours will endure these traitors."

comfrance.135.t: "The Paris Trial"
comfrance.135.d: "The various leading figures of the Front Populaire, as well as other prominent potential allies of theirs, such as Maurice Gamelin, have been arrested and are being tried for treason. The Paris Trial aims to prove that Blum and his associates have undermined the Revolution and 'weakened France's defences against the German foe'. Blum, being both a lawyer and excellent public speaker, has used the courtroom to make a brilliant indictment of the Jacobin regime. Gamelin has remained silent throughout; refusing to recognise the court's right to try him.\n\nThe trial has not gone according to plan and the defendants have, despite heavy manipulation of the proceedings, proven largely successful in rebutting the charges, and won sympathetic coverage in both the unofficial domestic and international press. It has become such an embarrassment to our Communist regime that some of the leadership is considering ordering it called off. Others wish to push forward and execute the defendants regardless, as they have become far too great a threat to be allowed to go free."
comfrance.135.a: "Execute these traitors!"
comfrance.135.b: "Call the whole thing off."

comfrance.136.t: "Anti-Jacobin Riots"
comfrance.136.d: "Following the execution of the Paris Trial defendants, the city has risen up against the government, although lacking leadership or outside aid it is doomed to fail."
comfrance.136.a: "Crush them!"

comfrance.137.t: "Gamelin's March on Paris"
comfrance.137.d: "Reports are reaching the Renseignements Généraux that units loyal to the civil war general Maurice Gamelin have mutinied and declared for the Front Populaire. Gamelin is marching on Paris!"
comfrance.137.a: "We shall resist these rebels!"
comfrance.137.b: "The rebels seize the capital!"

comfrance.138.t: "The Front Populaire Restores Order"
comfrance.138.d: "The Front Populaire has seized Paris and have begun purging the Jacobins from the city. Communes throughout France have taken this opportunity to liquidate their own branches of the Communist Party. Gamelin and Blum have restored the formerly abolished Syndicalist institutions, the CGT and BGT, and in emergency elections Gamelin has been elected as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail with Blum appointed Chairman of the Comité de Salut Public. Now that this grand alliance of Syndicalists, Social Democrats and Socialists have seized power, they hope to undo the totalitarian oppression emposed on the French citizens by the Jacobins"
comfrance.138.a: "C'est la lutte finale..."

comfrance.139.t: "Gamelin's Coup Fails"
comfrance.139.d: "We successfully resisted the forces of the traitor Gamelin who has now turned tail and fled south with the Arm of the Communist Revolution in hot pursuit! However, the partisans of the Front Populaire have gone ahead with their revolt in the north despite this set back, although they are sure to be crushed by our loyal units."
comfrance.139.a: "Crush them!"

comfrance.140.t: "Battle of Toulouse"
comfrance.140.d: "The last remains of Gamelin's rebels have occupied the city of Toulouse. Now that we have them cornered we shall dispatch our loyal forces to destroy them!"
comfrance.140.a: "Death to the traitors!"

comfrance.141.t: "Communard France in Chaos"
comfrance.141.d: "The extremist Jacobin faction has driven the illegitimate Commune to the precipice. The socialists fight among themselves as France burns. The traitor general Maurice Gamelin failed to overthrow the Communists with his first attempt at a march on Paris and was forced to retreat south. Now, we have received word via secret channels that Gamelin is willing to recognize our government, as he views us as a lesser evil than the deplorable Jacobines.\n\nAlthough considered one of the worst traitors France has ever seen for leading the reds in the first civil war which saw us reduced to our exile in Algiers, this could be our best chance to return home and drive out the craven Communards that stole it from us."
comfrance.141.a: "This is our moment! To France!"
comfrance.141.b: "He is a traitor. He will die a traitor."

comfrance.142.t: "Gamelin Joins The Nationalists!"
comfrance.142.d: "The arch-traitor Gamelin has declared for the Exiles! His soldiers are advancing on Marseille, surely to pave the way for the Nationalist forces that are even now readying to invade our homeland. Although this shows that he has abandoned his erstwhile allies in the Front Populaire, the syndicalists have taken this opportunity to redouble their efforts, launching uprisings across France."
comfrance.142.a: "Crush them!"

comfrance.143.t: "A War of Opportunity?"
comfrance.143.d: "The continuing chaos in France is reassuring, yet certain members of the General Staff are pushing the Kaiser to use this window of opportunity to launch an attack westward against the Commune - a house divided cannot stand, surely. While we may not get a better chance than this, our economy is still crippled by the events of Black Monday."
comfrance.143.a: "Attack!"
comfrance.143.b: "Now is not the time..."

comfrance.144.t: "Communal Elections of 1941"
comfrance.144.d: "As planned in 1936, the five-year term of the current Bourse Générale du Travail comes to an end. It is time to discuss economic and internal policies as well as foreign matters, so that the BGT may elect the new members of the executive Comité Salut Public."
comfrance.144.a: "Let's get to work, camarades!"

comfrance.145.t: "BGT Elections 1941 - Status of the Military"
comfrance.145.d: "It's been five years since the last great reform of the revolution's armed forces and the French army has soared to new heights. However, the various factions of the CGT still disagree on the continued development of the Guarantor of National Integrity."
comfrance.145.a: "Travailleurs: Modernisation and optimisation!"
comfrance.145.b: "Jacobins: A more independent high command is needed!"
comfrance.145.c: "Sorelians: The army must be completely subjugated to the CGT!"
comfrance.145.e: "Anarchistes: Liberalise the army and promote volunteer service!"

comfrance.146.t: "BGT Elections 1941 - Internal Security"
comfrance.146.d: "With France continuously being threatened by both foreign and domestic enemies, the issue of our internal security has been raised in the elections."
comfrance.146.a: "Travailleurs: The Sûreté Populaire is doing well enough!"
comfrance.146.b: "Jacobins: We need paramilitary gendarmes to keep the peace!"
comfrance.146.c: "Sorelians: The secret police MUST be more active!"
comfrance.146.e: "Anarchistes: Democratise the Sûreté Populaire!"

comfrance.147.t: "BGT Elections 1941 - External Security"
comfrance.147.d: "As the revolution marches on, the office of the Renseignements Généraux has continued to hold key influence within the political framework of the federation and, as a result, is thus hotly contended."
comfrance.147.a: "Travailleurs: The current system is satisfactory."
comfrance.147.b: "Jacobins: The RG must focus on supporting revolutionaries abroad!"
comfrance.147.c: "Sorelians: The RG shall be introduced to Totalist doctrine!"
comfrance.147.e: "Anarchistes: The BGT must control the Renseignements Généraux!"

comfrance.148.t: "BGT Elections 1941 - Economic Policies"
comfrance.148.d: "The Syndicalist economy has ensured considerable betterment for the masses, but discord still exists between the four main factions as to which way it should develop."
comfrance.148.a: "Travailleurs: Maintain the Syndicalist course!"
comfrance.148.b: "Jacobins: Centralisation is needed!"
comfrance.148.c: "Sorelians: We must focus on the armament industries!"
comfrance.148.e: "Anarchistes: More power to the Cooperatives!"

comfrance.149.t: "BGT Elections 1941 - Foreign Policy"
comfrance.149.d: "Undoubtedly one of the most important issues for the next Comité would be how to handle the radically changing world developments. The Travailleurs argue for further cooperation within the Internationale, whilst the Anarchistes wish to commence a wave of liberation to sweep the old order away everywhere it lingers. Both Sorelians and Jacobins hold hawkish views."
comfrance.149.a: "Travailleurs: The Internationale must guarantee peace!"
comfrance.149.b: "Jacobins: The red flag must advance everywhere!"
comfrance.149.c: "Sorelians: The reactionaries must be destroyed completely!"
comfrance.149.e: "Anarchistes: Secure a European socialism!"

comfrance.150.t: "BGT Elections 1941: Travailleur Majority"
comfrance.150.d: "As the votes tickle in from the many communes of our great Federation, it has become clear that the Travailleur faction has scored a majority in the Bourse Générale du Travail.\n\nHowever, the grouping is split between the moderates of Leon Jouhaux and the more militant members gathering around Benoît Frachon. Regardless of whoever claims the mantle of leadership, the Commune of France will certainly be in good hands."
comfrance.150.a: "Congratulations, Camarade Jouhaux."
comfrance.150.b: "Congratulations, Camarade Frachon."

comfrance.151.t: "BGT Elections 1941: Jacobin Majority"
comfrance.151.d: "As the votes tickle in from the many communes of our great Federation, it has become clear that the Jacobins have scored a majority in the Bourse Générale du Travail.\n\nDuclos, known as the Red Dwarf, will form the new Comité while the new Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail will be Marcel Cachin, the long-time chief editor of the Humanité newspaper. The top military leaders are expected to stay in place."
comfrance.151.a: "Congratulations, Camarade Cachin."

comfrance.152.t: "BGT Elections 1941: Sorelian Majority"
comfrance.152.d: "As the votes tickle in from the many communes of our great Federation, it has become clear that the Sorelians have scored a majority in the Bourse Générale du Travail.\n\nCamarade Bucard, the most brilliant leader of the orthodox Sorelians, is expected to form the new Comité, while the new Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail will be Georges Valois, the Grandfather of all Syndicalists."
comfrance.152.a: "Congratulations, Camarade Valois."

comfrance.153.t: "BGT Elections 1941: Anarchiste Majority"
comfrance.153.d: "As the votes tickle in from the many communes of our great Federation, it has become clear that the Anarchiste faction has scored a majority in the Bourse Générale du Travail.\n\nCamarade Guérin, the energetic and popular leader of the Anarchiste faction, is expected to form the new Comité, while the new Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail will be Nestor Makhno, the Domwbrowski of today."
comfrance.153.a: "Congratulations, Camarade Makhno."

comfrance.154.t: "BGT Elections 1941: No Majority Achieved"
comfrance.154.d: "As none of the factions within the CGT has managed to achieve a majority, the leaders of the various groupings have begun negotiating about the possibility of creating different kinds of coalition governments."
comfrance.154.a: "The Travailleur-Anarchiste bloc is restored to power!"
comfrance.154.b: "Left Travailleurs and orthodox Sorelians form a coalition!"
comfrance.154.c: "Georges Valois and his Totalist Sorelians seize the BGT!"

comfrance.155.t: "Communal Elections of 1946"
comfrance.155.d: "The major issue is the re-integration in the Commune of former Social-Democrats that left fifteen years ago. The Travailleurs, now the most reformist faction within the CGT, want to continue the democratisation process and push for an open arms policy towards the Social-Democrats. The Anarchistes, although in favour of liberalisation, oppose that policy, as well as the now declining Sorelians. The Jacobins, of course, still advocate a Bolshevik-like reform."
comfrance.155.a: "Travailleur majority : We have to make room for our Social-Democratic friends."
comfrance.155.b: "Sorelian majority : No decay of the revolutionary values will be tolerated."
comfrance.155.c: "Anarchiste majority : Proletarian democracy does not require Social-Democrats."
comfrance.155.e: "Jacobin majority : The Commune is ready for Bolshevism."

comfrance.156.t: "Communal Elections of 1951"
comfrance.156.d: "Thirty years have passed since the Commune of France was established. Our way to socialism and prosperity has been hard and long. Now, when the people choose the new government, our main goal is not only to develop Syndicalism, but also to protect 'des droits de l'homme et du citoyen', such as democracy and the right to happiness."
comfrance.156.a: "Travailleur majority - Democratisation of the Commune should be gradual."
comfrance.156.b: "Sorelian majority - Totalism shall stand triumphant."
comfrance.156.c: "Anarchiste majority - The stateless society awaits!"
comfrance.156.e: "Jacobin majority - We are true Communards."

comfrance.157.t: "Nestor Makhno Retires"
comfrance.157.d: "A towering figure in French as well as European revolutionary politics, Nestor Makhno has finally chosen to retire from public life. Leadership of the Anarchiste movement has passed on to the dynamic Daniel Guerin."
comfrance.157.a: "Fare thee well."

comfrance.902.d: "The Revolutionary Legion was established during the French civil war as a paramilitary force to protect revolutionaries from reactionary mobs, since then the Legion has greatly increased in both number and power. Legion outposts can be found across France and the Sorelian Red Eagle can be found flying high above well armed militants loyal to Valois. \n\nSince the victory of the Sorelians there has been suggestions to merge the Legion with the French Revolutionary Armed Forces, despite resistance from notable generals such as Maurice Gamelin, on this day the Legion will officially be incorporated into thr military under the command of General Marcel Bucard."
comfrance.902.a: "March on honorable camarades!"

comfrance.903.t: "Rise of the Sorelians"
comfrance.903.d: "The Sorelians emerged during the French Civil War as violent, revolutionary and staunchly anti-reactionary movement when Georges Valois, Hubert Lagardelle and Jacques Arthuys decided that the time was right to turn their underground political group, Cercle Proudhon, into a fully fledged political movement. These three men observed the Weltkrieg as the beginning of a new age, one where capitalism and traditionalism would be replaced by syndicalism and nationalism. Despite being former associates of Action Française the three launched a scathing campaign against social conservatives, monarchists and all who stood against the revolution. \n\nAdopting the red eagle as their symbol the Sorelians have quickly gained popularity amongst the working-class who saw their organised marches, uniformed militia and violent altercations with reactionaries as a form of expressing their outrage to the establishment. When the Civil War ended and the anarcho-syndicalists took the seat of power in Paris the Sorelians changed their rhetoric anti-reactionary to anti-anarchy. \n\n Up until now the Travailleur's have used the Sorelians as a bulwark against reactionaries however now are terrified that these radicals may at long last turn on them in the upcoming elections. Demanding; centralization, revanchism against Germany and a restoration of French nationalism the Sorelians now poses a major threat to the Anarcho-Syndicalist Commune with it’s paramilitary, the Revolutionary Legion, engaging in street fights and the intimidation of political opponents. Will the Sorelians bring France into disarray once more or shall they lead the glorious charge of National-Syndicalism?"
comfrance.903.a: "We must be wary of these radicals."

comfrance.930.t: "Return of the Jacobins"
comfrance.930.d: "Clenching the red flag of socialism in one hand and a copy of the Communist Manifesto in the other, the Jacobins have taken Commune politics by storm through their undying dedication to Marxism. Inspired by both Lenin’s failed Bolshevik Revolution and French revolutionary history they seek to bring an end to Syndicalism, citing it as a failed ideology manipulated by ‘Social-Reactionaries’ to further control the proletariat. Led by revolutionary hero, Maurice Thorez, a man who has now forsaken his former Syndicalist loyalties and pledged allegiance to the international communist revolution. Thorez has stated his conversion to what many perceive as an obsolete ideology, is a direct response to the growing bureaucracy and corruption in CGT. \n\nTaking their name from the violent revolutionary movement under the leadership of Maximilien Robespierre, the Jacobins see themselves a vanguard against anarchists and social-reactionaries who are more than willing to use violence to spread the word of Marx. Currently they are engaged in a bitter rivalry with the Sorelians that has escalated into large scale street fights between the Revolutionary Legion and Jacobin militants. However, despite the use of violence and a previously complete rejection of the CGT’s authority, Thorez has announced his intention for the Jacobins to stand in the upcoming elections. It is to be seen how receptive the greater populace are to Thorez’s idealistic communist state, will they embrace the legacy of Lenin or loyally defend Syndicalism?"
comfrance.930.a: "Communism? Who would fight for that dead ideology?"

comfrance.931.t: "The State Funeral of Chairman Valois"
comfrance.931.d: "The nation weeps the loss of Chairman Georges Valois. Despite the obvious threat that holding a public funeral ceremony creates it was agreed by the Sorelian Council that they must not give into fear. Parisian police, a reserve infantry division and members of the Revolutionary Legion flooded the streets whilst the citizens of Paris flocked to pay their respects. The Red Eagle banner was hung from building to building, torches were carried by a parade of gloomy looking legionaries, an atmosphere of depression had engulfed the city. Valois’s body was preserved in a glass coffin surrounded by large golden eagles posing ominously. The chairman had only served for a short time however his impact on the Commune will last for an era..."
comfrance.931.a: "Victory even in death!"

comfrance.904.t: "The Day of Infamy"
comfrance.904.d: "On this day the entire nation mourns the tragedy of our late Chairman. While Chairman Valois was giving a fiery speech to the enthusiastic public beneath the Arc de Triomphe three anarchist assassins managed to get past security and the crowd; one of them proclaimed Valois as a traitor to the revolution firing his pistol at a bewildered Valois whilst the other two threw homemade explosives at the stage. The resulting blast injured all three men on the stage, the latter two being cabinet member Marcel Déat and Director of the Comité de Renseignements Généraux, Pierre Laval. All three were immediately driven to the nearest hospital whilst brave legionaries returned fire at the terrorist scum, two were shot dead whilst the last is in captivity. Thankfully camrades Déat and Laval survived the explosion with minor injuries however Valois did not, despite the hospital’s best efforts, the resulting blast and stray bullets where too much for the aging leader. Our dear Chairman was a true revolutionary and his ideals will not be forgotten nor will his death be in vain.\n\nThe difficult task of choosing a successor now falls upon the Sorelian high council, in the meantime a recovering Laval has been instated as the temporary head of government until a successor is chosen. The fate of France has once again been radically altered."
comfrance.904.a: "The flame of Sorelianism will not be extinguished, glory in death to the Chairman!"

comfrance.907.t: "General Doriot Restructures the Military"
comfrance.907.d: "Up until now the L'Armée Populaire de la Commune de France has been composed of ideologically dedicated and loyal soldiers however is rife with disorganization, self-driven goals and lazy generals unable to efficiently communicate with each other. According official Sorelian reports that ends now, with General Jacques Doriot in control of military affairs, the armed forces can finally receive the modernisation it severely requires.\n\nOnly the most loyal generals will receive promotions directly from Chairman Valois, the differing militias will be organised into a unified standing army and the nation’s increased focus on industry will allow for the highest grade military weapons and gear to be provided to soldiers. These are the promises that Doriot has pledged and in return Valois has granted him unrestricted authority in military affairs, he now reports only to the Chairman himself."
comfrance.907.a: "The military after all is the protector of the revolution."

comfrance.908.t: "Government Centralization"
comfrance.908.d: "With the election over and the Sorelians securing the majority vote, Chairman Valois sets out to accomplish his first order of business, centralizing the government. For too long the French proletariat have been held back by the bureaucratic binds of the Travailleurs. The Sorelians will not stand for this anymore, we must centralize the leadership and destroy the autonomous liberties granted to communes. Director of the Comité de Renseignements Généraux, Pierre Laval, has addressed the senate on behalf of Valois asserting the legality of these changes in the name of protecting the revolution."
comfrance.908.a: "A strong people require a strong state."
comfrance.908.b: "Unlimited power!"

comfrance.909.t: "Revolutionary Legionnaires Raid Union Headquaters"
comfrance.909.d: "Within the Commune of France there are numerous unions vying for control of the country’s politics.These unions hold differing loyalties, some support the Anarchists, some the Travailleurs and even a few loyal to the Jacobins. These ideological differences are unacceptable and stand in the way of true French unity. If we are to move forward with centralizing the government, we need to unite the people under our political beliefs. Revolutionary Legion commander, Marcel Bucard, has launched coordinated raids on important union headquarters with hundreds of union leaders being arrested under the crime of disloyal ideals. Once again the Legion has succeeded in defending the revolution."
comfrance.909.a: "We shall bring the unions back into the fold, through negotiations or force."

comfrance.910.t: "Tensions Arise Within the Sorelians"
comfrance.910.d: "After the death of Georges Valois, the Sorelians have split between several factions inside the party. The largest and most influential ones being the Vanguardists led by Marcel Déat, and the Ultranational-Syndicalists led by Marcel Bucard. Both of the factions  have been actively fighting for dominance over the party, and absorbing the smaller factions in an attempt to rival each other. The Vanguardists have the most influence over the Sorleian aligned unions and the old guard, members who were involved in the founding of the Sorelians, whilst the Ultranational-Syndicalists have the loyalty of the Revolutionary Legion. Caught in between the crossfire is the newly inaugurated president of the Sorelian Council, Pierre Laval, who has forged close relations with both factions in an attempt to maintain some sort of stability."
comfrance.910.a: "Can it get any worse?"

comfrance.911.t: "Black Guard Launch Bombing Campaign"
comfrance.911.d: "In response to Sorelian aggression and discrimination against anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists, the Black Guard have started a bombing campaign. Bombing any business, office or administrative building related to the Sorelians. "
comfrance.911.a: "Do these animals have no civility?"

comfrance.912.t: "Pierre Laval Calls For Sorelian Unity"
comfrance.912.d: "Pierre Laval, current President of the Sorelian council which is currently acting as the interim government, has called for unity in the Sorelian party in response to the factional division. He has called for the Vanguardists and Ultranational-Syndicalists to make peace until the Black Guard insurgency is dealt with. In his most recent speech to the council he stated it would be useless to fight for dominance over the nation if the party cannot even assert dominance over its own internal affairs."
comfrance.912.a: "Laval is right, France requires unity."
comfrance.912.b: "Get off the fence and pick a side!"

comfrance.913.t: "Rise of the Black Guard"
comfrance.913.d: "In direct response to the oppressive Sorelian rule over political opposition, anarchists have united under one movement. Named the ‘Black Guard’, its purpose is to destabilize France through bombings, assassinations and vandalisim. Inspired partially by the Illegalist movement, which has taken some power within the rebel circles. The Guard have made it clear they will stop at nothing to destroy the National Workers State. It’s rumoured that the main leader of the Black Guard is famed Ukrainian anarchist who was exiled to France, Nestor Makhno. The Sorelians, after hearing about these rumors, ordered a raid of Makhno’s residence. However, upon the initial raid Makhno was nowhere to be found further fueling these rumors. The underground movement has so far proved difficult to deal with due to its secretive nature and seemingly random attacks."
comfrance.913.a: "We must put a stop to this rebellion!"

comfrance.914.t: "Déat and Bucard Rein In Their Factions"
comfrance.914.d: "After the tense vocal altercations between Marcel Déat and Marcel bucard which left the Sorelians fractured into two camps our glorious defender of stability, Laval, has used his influence and respect to cool tensions. At the first Sorelian conference following Chariman Valois’s assassination both men stood on stage with Laval and expressed their newfound determination to maintin unity for the sake of avoiding anarchy. How long will this ceasefire last?"
comfrance.914.a: "All focus must be put on destroying the Anarchist menace!"

comfrance.915.t: "Vanguardists and Ultranational-Syndicalists Run Riots In The Streets"
comfrance.915.d: "After the death of Georges Valois, the Sorelian factions of Vanguardists and Ultranational-Syndicalists have been rioting in the streets, fighting each other despite both behind under the same party. This is, however, not the best position for either faction as anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists are growing stronger, and growing further as France slowly becomes the ideal vision of anarchy."
comfrance.915.a: "Brothers kill brothers."
comfrance.915.b: "Laval cracks down on this chaos!"

comfrance.916.t: "Black Guard Take Advantage of the Chaos"
comfrance.916.d: "The Black Guard have, unsurprisingly, taken advantage of the onoging tormoil ravaging France. Storming political assemblies, taking politicians as hostages until their demands are fulfilled. The Sorelians haven’t responded to this aggression, as they are dealing with political infighting and riots on the streets."
comfrance.916.a: "France stands on the brink of anarchy."

comfrance.917.t: "Sorelian Politicians Executed By Black Guard Militants!"
comfrance.917.d: "After a week of no response, the Black Guard militants have started executing Sorelian politicians held as hostages. The Black Guard generals have said that they will, again, not stop until their demands are fulfilled. Their demands are the replacement of current leadership with Black Guard leader Nestor Makhno, the permanent banning of Sorelians from office, and execution of Marcel Déat and Marcel Bucard. Until then, the march towards Paris continues."
comfrance.917.a: "The end is nigh..."

comfrance.918.t: "Anarcho-Syndicalist Unions Openly Declare Loyalty to the Black Guard"
comfrance.918.d: "The anarcho-syndicalist unions have declared loyalty to the Black Guard and their leader Nestor Makhno. While the collaboration of anarchists and anarcho-Syndicalists has been noted, this development means that the Black Guard now has full leadership of the anarchist factions. This is a very threatening development to the Sorelians, as the Black Guard are currently stopped outside of Paris. They have 24 hours left to fulfill the demands..."
comfrance.918.a: "Traitors!"

comfrance.919.t: "Black Guard Seize Paris!"
comfrance.919.d: "The Sorelians’ time is up, the Black Guard have marched into Paris, killing anyone and everyone in the streets who dare oppose them. The Sorelian party headquarters is currently being stormed, as loud gunshots and screaming are heard inside. No doubt this will be a bloody day in the history of French politics."
comfrance.919.a: "Dieu nous sauve tous"
comfrance.919.b: "Loyal Legionnaires fend off the attackers!"

comfrance.920.t: "Day of the Rope"
comfrance.920.d: "After the temporary peace of the Sorelian factions, the assassin who killed Valois has finally been sentenced after an intense period of interrogations. His sentence was, unsurprisingly, a public hanging. While the Sorelian council saw it as a fitting execution, they didn’t really believe anybody would intervene in his execution. And..."
comfrance.920.a: "...The assassin's neck snaps has he is hoisted by the rope, his lifeless body is left for all to see!"
comfrance.920.b: "...Black Guard militants appear firing aimlessly, in the chaos the assassin escapes!"

comfrance.921.t: "Black Guad Leaders Rounded Up En Masse"
comfrance.921.d: "Following the execution, Black Guard leaders have been getting desperate; showing themselves in public and being either arrested or gunned down. Today was an especially productive day as a large number of Black Guard leaders have been rounded up and executed. This is no doubt thanks to the collaboration of the Sorelian factions and also thanks to the incredible efforts of brave Legionary commanders!"
comfrance.921.a: "Time to punish these maniacs."

comfrance.922.t: "Revolutionary Legion Put Down Anarchist Riots in Paris"
comfrance.922.d: "Today, after a very bloody hour, the Revolutionary Legion has finally crushed the anarchist riots in Paris. This uprising was allegedly an attempted coup launched by Nestor Makhno and remaining Black Guard loyalists. Clearly overestimating their support the anarchists failed to rally the numbers they hoped, and thanks to our counter intelligence commanders was able to lead a successful counter force of Legionnaires that flushed these scum from the streets of Paris. This event seems to have worsened their public image with Parisian residents also taking up arms and aiding in the roundup of suspected anarchists."
comfrance.922.a: "Time to hammer the final nail in this insurgency."

comfrance.923.t: "Black Guard Militants Flee France"
comfrance.923.d: "After the absolute disaster of the Paris riots the remaining Black Guard militants have fled France and are seeking asylum in Spain thanks to the efforts of the CNT, our intelligence has informed us that Spanish anarchists have been smuggling weapons into and out of France. We shall put an end to this by increasing the number of armed patrols along the border."
comfrance.923.a: "Like rats fleeing a sinking ship."

comfrance.924.t: "Makhno Found Dead In A Black Guard Safehouse"
comfrance.924.d: "Today at exactly 3 in the afternoon the dead body of Nestor Makhno was discovered by Legionary commandos during an operation to infiltrate a now abandoned Black Guard safehouse. Makhno, according to investigators, was already dead by the time he had been found as his body was entirely drained of blood and ice cold with the only notable features being two bullet wounds to the back of the head. Police investigators have ruled out any foul play and have ruled his death a suicidie. "
comfrance.924.a: "Good riddance!"

comfrance.925.t: "Black Guard Insurgency Destroyed!"
comfrance.925.d: "The insurgency was destroyed, totally crushed under the force of the Revolutionary Army! Never shall anarchists rule France! Long live the Sorelians!"
comfrance.925.a: "France remains strong and stable."

comfrance.926.t: "Sorelian Council Elects New Leader"
comfrance.926.d: "Now that the major threat has been dealt with, it’s time to get back on track and finish what was started before. The two major contenders are: Vanguard faction leader Marcel Deat, who is very popular among the old guard of the Sorelians and union establishment; and Ultra-National Syndicalist faction leader Marcel Bucard, who is very popular among the Revolutionary Legion and the common people of France. The results are now in and the council has voted for..."
comfrance.926.a: "...Marcel Déat!"
comfrance.926.b: "...Marcel Bucard!"

comfrance.906.t: "Marcel Bucard Assumes Control"
comfrance.906.d: "With the anarchist insurgency successfully put down and the mourning of our dear former leader no longer fresh in the minds of the populace, the Sorelian council has finally made its decision on who shall inherit Valois role as Chairman of the French Workers. Interim president Leval has stated that his role was always temporary and now is the perfect time for him to return to his equally important position as Director of the Comité de Renseignements. Despite tensions within the Sorelains, primarily between leader of the Vanguardist faction, Marcel Déat, and leader of the Ultranational-Syndicalist leader, Marcel Bucard, the council has arrived at its decision.\n\n Marcel Bucard and his Ultranational-Syndicalist faction shall lead the nation, upon hearing this decision Bucard’s supporters ecstatically arose with a thunderous applause chanting: ‘‘Hail Chairman Bucard!’’ Meanwhile Déat was seen storming out of the council conference along with his allies, General Jacques Doriot and René Belin. France is now in the hands of the most extreme and violent faction of the Sorelians, it is to be seen how the greater populace will react to this announcement."
comfrance.906.a: "Hail the new chairman!"

comfrance.905.t: "Marcel Déat Assumes Control"
comfrance.905.d: "With the anarchist insurgency successfully put down and the mourning of our dear former leader no longer fresh in the minds of the populace, the Sorelian council has finally made its decision on who shall inherit Valois role as Chairman of the French Workers. Interim president Leval has stated that his role was always temporary and now is the perfect time for him to return to his equally important position as Director of the Comité de Renseignements. Despite tensions within the Sorelains, primarily between leader of the Vanguardist faction, Marcel Déat, and leader of the Ultranational-Syndicalist leader, Marcel Bucard, the council has arrived at its decision.\n\n Marcel Déat and his Vanguardist faction shall lead the nation, upon hearing this decision Déat’s supporters ecstatically arose with a thunderous applause chanting: ‘‘Glory to Chairman Déat!’’ Meanwhile Bucard was seen storming out of the council conference along with his allies, René V. Binet and Marc Augier. France remains safe in the hands of Sorelian establishment as members of the party’s OId Guard are pleased to hear that Bucard’s more extreme faction have lost, it is to be seen how the greater populace will react to this announcement."
comfrance.905.a: "Glory to the new chairman!"

comfrance.927.t: "French Futurism"
comfrance.927.d: "Futurism is an artistic and social movement that has existed since the 20s however as of recently has emerged in French society as a popular force. Emphasising speed, technology, youth and violence, the Futurist movement wishes to abolish all elements of the past whilst it’s leaders, who comprise mostly of artists and poets, rally the youth towards autopia where man has triumphed over nature. The movement’s increasingly notable force in politics is credited to Marcel Bucard’s favourable opinion of Futurism, Ultranational-Syndicalist Sorelianism has some striking similarities with the glorification of violence, rally of the youth and a rejection of bourgeoisie traditionalism being examples.\n\nIn return Futurists, Surrealists and other subsections of the growing Avant-Garde have lent their support to Bucard with prominent figures such as Antonin Artaud and Louis-Ferdinand Céline meeting Bucard in Paris to discuss how best to abolish reactionary thought."
comfrance.927.a: "We must accelerate to the future camarades!"

comfrance.928.t: "Changing the National Flag?"
comfrance.928.d: "With the Ultranational-Syndicalist faction of the Sorelians in control it has been proposed that we should change the national flag to better suit this change."
comfrance.928.a: "Keep the Red Eagle of Sorel flying high!"
comfrance.928.b: "Raise the Cog and Sword!"

comfrance.929.t: "Changing the National Flag?"
comfrance.929.d: "With the Vanguardist faction of the Sorelians in control it has been proposed that we should change the national flag to better suit this change."
comfrance.929.a: "Keep the Red Eagle of Sorel flying high!"
comfrance.929.b: "Raise the Vanguardist Hammer, Sword and Torch!"

comfrance.932.t: "Sorelian Propaganda Targets Jewish Citizens"
comfrance.932.d: "For as long as Jews have resided in France anti-semitism has been a constant threat, throughout the Middle Ages French monarchs Jews have suffered persecuation and expelsion. As recently as the Dreyfus affair that ended in 1906, Jewish citizens have been perceived as enemies of the French people. This historic struggle has been used by Chief Bucard as justification that the Jewish peoples are not only outsiders, but villains who have been fought by the French times. The Sorelians have begun targeting Jews, they accuse them of profiteering off France’s instability and sowing division amongst citizens. Sorelian propaganda has launched scathing attacks and the Revolutionary Legion have begun rounding up Jewish intellectuals, bankers, businessmen and rabbis to be sent to unknown locations.\n\nWhilst Bucard struggles to maintian power of the nation and deals with lingering anarchist terrorism it is undoubtable that this persecutation is purerly done to distract the French people from the nation’s unsure future..."
comfrance.932.a: "Gradually we began to hate them..."

comfrance.933.t: "Formation of the National Popular Union"
comfrance.933.d: "Chairman Déat has announced the formation of the National Popular Union, the  Confédération Générale du Travail had previously comprised many autonomous labour unions representing a diverse array of professions and ideologies. Unsurprisingly this is what caused the CGT to be brought down by division, however since the Sorelains took power many unions have been cut out of the picture leaving only those loyal to the government. The next step of this plan is to unite all loyal unions under one state sponsored labour organisation. The National Popular Union will include differing areas of professions in order to represent all workers of the nation, it also pledges complete devotion to the Chairman. Finally the labourers can find themselves under the righteous protection of one big union!"
comfrance.933.a: "The workers stand with Chairman Déat."

comfrance.934.t: "Groupe X-Crise"
comfrance.934.d: "Groupe X-Crise is a technocratic movement formed by economic theorists who advocate economic planning and the pursuit of technology in order to raise the efficiency of the nation. The CGT had largely ignored Group X due to their non-syndicalist approach at solving economic issues however Bucard has proven himself to be open to adopting new methods. He has invited the group to advise his cabinet and aid in the establishment of his new corporate state."
comfrance.934.a: "A new economic plan for a new France."

comfrance.935.t: "A Nation Re-Energised!"
comfrance.935.d: "French Society has always suffered under the weak, the frail, the impoverished of corporeality and of mind - for centuries, it was ruled by the weak and frail, it was put under their tyranny of weakness, their tyranny of lack of vitality. It is nescessary then, as a revolutionary Sorelian State, that we seek to estabilish at all costs a French society that is unlike the ones that preceded it in the last 1000 years - one of strength, vitality, and human perfection. The Frenchman must at all costs rival and go beyond the prowess of the German Ape-Man, who is such a brute that they lack even the most basic understanding of the world like we have. The Frenchman, unlike the German counterpart, has always had an underlying sense of vitality and strength, one that was beyond all his neighbors which were either falling asleep in their siestas or being so stupid that they can't change the oil on a lamp. It is nescessary then, to enact an enormous and violent purge of the weak which corrupt French society and have done so for the last thousand years, much like a class war which instead of involving the ruled and the ruler, it instead involves the weak and the strong. Therefore, the Revolutionary Legion has now made tremendous efforts to cleanse our lands of those considered feminine, weak, and frail, and raise up to the sky those who are strong, vital, and in unending militancy against the Ape-German and other reactionaries.\n\nMarc Augier has also begun extremely extensive efforts to create the perfect Frenchman; one that has been dispelled of all elements of Royal frailness, of the uneducation of the masses, that is both intelligent and built like a tank - this search has made us go through hundreds of Frenchmen, to find the perfect specimen. Unfortunately this perfect Frenchman is still being searched for despite hundreds of people volunteering to go through our scientist's hands."
comfrance.935.a: "Survival of the strongest..."

comfrance.936.t: "The Youth Carry the Torch of the Revolution!"
comfrance.936.d: "The Youth of France are the definite future of the Nation. It is nescessary, at all costs, to ensure that they entrench their ideals into Sorel, into Déat, into France. We need, as a State, to protect the youth from reactionary ideals and give them the light of our vanguard, to give them the light of violence, of militancy, of power and unending restlessness. Therefore, Chairman Déat has created the Déat Jeunesse, a paramilitary organization that seeks to train young boys into becoming militant and extremely loyal beacons of the Revolution through rigorous training, education, and camraderie. We shall ensure that France is protected by her children, and that France protects her children."
comfrance.936.a: "Totalitarian militancy is needed in this age of reactionism."

comfrance.940.t: "Thorez Leads the World Revolution Into a New Era!"
comfrance.940.d: "The Syndicalist revolution was only the beginning, whilst their job at tearing down the Third French Republic was admirable it was also destined to fail. Syndicalism is simply a roadblock on the path to true equality, the bureaucracy and corruption of capitalist democracy was simply adopted by the CGT. Now that France is led by a true working class vanguard under the direction of Chairman Thorez, it can lead the rest of the world to the future! A future that Marx, Engels and Lenin all envisioned! The age of the proletariat can begin!"
comfrance.940.a: "C'est la lutte finale."

comfrance.941.t: "Thorez Declares the New Revolution Victorious!"
comfrance.941.d: "It has been the dream of revolutionaries throughout the eras of modern France to build a nation of liberty, equality and fraternity. The Paris Commune came close to this as they embraced the spirit of a united proletariat, this is where the syndicalist Commune of France failed. It was unable to direct itself with a unified vision, the squabbling of political factions halted all progress. However now with a centralised leadership under Thorez, the true French revolution has been achieved. The legacy of the Jacobins, Commundards and Marx himself are in our hands, our Commune of Virtue can not fail!"
comfrance.941.a: "Liberté, égalité, fraternité."

comfrance.938.t: "Memories of Past Revolutions"
comfrance.938.d: "Thorez, as energetic as always, came to the Communard Square in Paris and made an announcement, like many he had done before. His arms moved with an energy unprecedented, his hairs flew in the air with great violence, and his heart was beating like the one of a horse. He screamed in adoration to the Commune, to the Revolution, proclaiming in profound militancy, that it was time to create a 'Communism with French Characteristics'.\n\nThis new Communism, he says, must do away with the ideals of Faure, Sorel, and other fifth-columnists and realize that France has an incredible and rich history of revolution and revolt. It is undoubtedly a Nation born out of revolution, a Nation that grew out of revolution, and a Nation that lives now in Revolution. It is clear to everyone, that France must follow her own way in Communism, to ensure a future in socialist society where the Commune lives and breathes independently, with profound power that shall eventually wipe the world from reactionary forces and bring about a new age of French Communism."
comfrance.938.a: "Hurrah! Thorez is our guidance!"

comfrance.939.t: "His Death Will No Longer Be In Vain"
comfrance.939.d: "Thorez, in his great crusade for the ideals of Leninism and the belief in the correct line of creative socialism across the world and France in particular, has declared that the broken line between Marxism and Lenin's Legacy has been restored, and subsequently France shall be the paragon of the Bolshevik Revolution, regardless if Russia will accept it or not. She shall transfer the Revolution to the whole world, in the ideals of Leninism and Marxism, the correct line of communism. It is so, then, that France shall at all costs abandon national idealisms and utopianisms and instead follow with the scientific and creative line of Socialism which shall save the world from reactionary capitalism."
comfrance.939.a: "Lenin's ideals live long in our hearts."

comfrance.942.t: "Chilean Camarades"
comfrance.942.d: "Thorez has instructed the military to prepare large quantities of armaments to be shipped across to our Chilean camarades, he hopes these ''gifts'' will persuade them into supporting the Leninist struggle."
comfrance.942.a: "For the international revolution!"

comfrance.943.t: "Patagonian Camarades"
comfrance.943.d: "Thorez has instructed the military to prepare large quantities of armaments to be shipped across to our Patagonian camarades, he hopes these ''gifts'' will persuade them into supporting the Leninist struggle."
comfrance.943.a: "For the international revolution!"

comfrance.944.t: "Mexican Camarades"
comfrance.944.d: "Thorez has instructed the military to prepare large quantities of armaments to be shipped across to our Mexican camarades, he hopes these ''gifts'' will persuade them into supporting the Leninist struggle."
comfrance.944.a: "For the international revolution!"

comfrance.945.t: "Nicaraguan Camarades"
comfrance.945.d: "Thorez has instructed the military to prepare large quantities of armaments to be shipped across to our Nicaraguan camarades, he hopes these ''gifts'' will persuade them into supporting the Leninist struggle."
comfrance.945.a: "For the international revolution!"

comfrance.946.t: "Georgian Camarades"
comfrance.946.d: "Thorez has instructed the military to prepare large quantities of armaments to be transported across to our Georgian camarades, he hopes these ''gifts'' will persuade them into supporting the Leninist struggle."
comfrance.946.a: "For the international revolution!"

comfrance.947.t: "Bharatiyan Camarades"
comfrance.947.d: "Thorez has instructed the military to prepare large quantities of armaments to be transported across to our Bharatiyan camarades, he hopes these ''gifts'' will persuade them into supporting the Leninist struggle."
comfrance.947.a: "For the international revolution!"

comfrance.948.t: "Quotations from Chairman Marcel Déat"
comfrance.948.d: "Books are an incredible source of knowledge that span centuries of Human thinking. It is logical, then, to know that there are thousands, if not tens of thousands of books, which are incredibly reactionary in nature and violently against our Sorelian Revolution. Our great Comrade, Marcel Déat, has declared then, that some factories must be directed towards book-making of a specific, single book, engineered to be the most perfect expression of the French Sorelian Revolution; Quotations from Chairman Déat. This book was created by Déat himself, of course, and edited by himself, published by the State, which of course, is an extension of Déat's benevolent and fierce hand against the reactionaries, and printed by state-owned companies. The only remaining part is distribution - which part of the French State is needing to be directed politically to the correct line of syndicalism? Of course, it's the Army! Tens of thousands of copies of the book have been distributed across the army to every single batallion, ensuring that each of them has a commander which will read every little part of this wonderful book for them, to educate them further into the light of Sorel's legacy. Many are already begging for the book to be released to the public, believing that the people want it so badly that they would be willing to fight for it."
comfrance.948.a: "Of course, publish it immediately for the public."

comfrance.949.t: "Hail to the Chief!"
comfrance.949.d: "France now represents a highly militarised state, populated by an aggressively nationalistpopulace eager for war. A populace who place strength as the most important aspect of a human, a populace who seem themselves as superior due to their French blood. A nation that swears undying loyalty to their Chief, this was once Marcel Bucard’s visions of a future. Now it is his reality. The Sorelians have a firm grip over every aspect of life, a country that now serves as a well oiled machine, one commanded by an all powerful director. This machine is starved for war and conquest..."
comfrance.949.a: "Le jour de gloire est arrivé!"

comfrance.950.t: "Long live the Chairman!"
comfrance.950.d: "The French National Workers State stands triumphant, Chairman Déat has constructed a regime impenetrable. The French military under Field Marshal, Jacques Doriot, has the might to repel any German attack whilst the CPAI works hard to prevent another Anarchist insurgency. Whilst France’s allies slowly crumble under domestic pressure, the Chairman is beloved by his people, he has brought peace and prosperity to the French workers!"
comfrance.950.a: "Allons enfants de la Patrie!"

comfrance.951.t: "Keep your friends close, and enemies closer..."
comfrance.951.d: "With the Confédération Générale du Travail under complete Sorelian domination we now face the problem of the other political factions being left directionless and redundant. The Jacobins and Anarchistes have already been declared enemies of the state due to their destructive beliefs. However there are those within the Travailleurs who could be swayed. Camrade Marcel Déat has proposed the idea of approaching certain Travailleurs who hold influence over the unions, by providing them with minimal powers we could better position ourselves as the legitimate representation of the workers. However, camrade Marcel Bucard has reputed this plan and demanded that all political rivals should be removed from power, stating their previous hostility to the Sorelians.\n\nWhich comrade should we listen to?"
comfrance.951.a: "Camarade Bucard is right! These people are our enemies."
comfrance.951.b: "Perhaps Déat has a point, we could convert them to our cause."

comfrance.952.t: "The End of Religion"
comfrance.952.d: "Today Maurice Thorez himself stepped upon a podium in central Paris and proclaimed the following, excerpted from a radio recording of his grandiose speech as his hands moved across the air and his lungs fiercely blew air out and in, his tongue vibrating in vivid corporeality against all opposition:\n\n'It is with great honor and great pride that I proclaim Religion is done. For tens of thousands of years, Humanity sat upon the dark cave of unknowingness, of fear and of ignorance, believing in magical fairytales about gods up in the sky, about gods of the Sun, about gods of the Earth, about gods of the Ocean. No longer - we, as the vanguard of humanity as a whole proclaims in one sole breath that Religion is done away with, it is no longer nescessary, and will never again be a valid form of thought. The reactionary forces that plagued mankind's brain for thousands of years has just been completely removed in the land of the Commune, and our comrade Marcel Cachin has just recently stated that he himself will ensure that the immense effort nescessary to finally wipe religion from even the most private of gatherings, from the most reactionary minds that permeate our lands, to even upper rankings in the Party which for some bizarre reason still hold on to this reactionary concept. No more. We are done with religion for-ever, and we shall ensure that the rest of the world will follow suit. What is next for our Commune? Of course, I understand, and the Party understands that the people need a cult, some form of myth to believe in - so, I have proclaimed the Cult of the Supreme Being, just like the one from the old French Revolution - and in it, a great myth of socialist realism will be put forward, one of reality, one of facts, and one of progressivism. One will believe now, profoundly, in their heart, in the ideals of the Revolution, not in the Church.'\n\nThe crowds of course, fiercely applauded, as comrades across the Commune rose in positive demonstrations to show their support for the PCF's decision."
comfrance.952.a: "Now, the minds of the people are free."

comfrance.953.t: "Second Reign of Terror Proclaimed"
comfrance.953.d: "'Desperately, thousands of Communards have realized that this might be their end, knowing that Thorez came upon the Commune Square, a newly formed square in the center of Paris, and proclaimed a Total War against reactionaries across the board, proclaiming that "The greatest war, most importantly before any great war against an outside, reactionary power, is that of an internal war, one which puts a great terror on the enemies of the people.' He had decided, in an order which rang across the world, that Terror was the Order of the Day.\n\nImmediately hundreds of mid and high-level Communard Anarchists, Sorelians, Syndicalists, and others were rushedly taken from their homes, put in a guillotine, and in front of everyone, killed like cattle, one after the other, becoming hunks of meat in the floor, losing every inch of their life, and so just like that, the Commune has slowly been draining itself of political expertise, scientists, members of the political scene, and more, with the strike of a guillotine.\n\nMuch like Robespierre, Thorez himself believed this wasn't enough. More blood had to be spilled for the beloved Commune to be cleansed of corruption. So, he smiled. In a field of sorrow, screams, and agony, he smiled."
comfrance.953.a: "After all, our beloved Commune is being saved."

comfrance.954.t: "The Great Lenin Guides Us"
comfrance.954.d: "It has been a great sorrow, nay, the greatest sorrow of the early 20th Century, that the great Lenin himself was brought down by reactionary forces in Russia. His ideals were unparallaled in knowledge and understanding of the correct line of Marxism, and it is with our profound belief that Marxism-Leninism is the future of the Commune. It has been an incredible, unprecedented corruption and rottenness that has taken over the European continent and beyond with Syndicalism, being a force that destroys the creative force of socialism and Lenin's ideals. Therefore, to show that the great legacy of our comrade Lenin did not fall in deaf ears, we shall construct a great statue of the man, made with great care in every aspect about his figure, from his forehead to his shoes. This statue, a grand expression of Socialism in the heart of our beautiful Commune, shall be the expression of creative socialism that the world needs in order to save it from Syndicalist corruption. It shall be made in the center of Paris, and through the great labour of our workers, it shall be done in just a few months."
comfrance.954.a: "Long live the creative socialist mindset of our comrade Lenin!"

comfrance.955.t: "The Hunt For The Anarchist"
comfrance.955.d: "The old Commune is dead, destroyed by anarcho-syndicalism, and so shall be her children, which spread across our beloved France like a cancer which needs to be cut out at all costs if the National State is to thrive.\n\nPaul Marion was anxious, looking through papers, contacting spies via telegram and encrypted telephone signals, wanting blood to feed his beloved State which demanded at all costs total loyalty and militant socialist belief. It is then, that when a medium-level Anarchist, a bastard son of Makhno, began organizing a "protracted people's war" against the State, it became clear that it was nescessary to wipe him like a bug which sat on the window. As Marion fiercely kept attacking, going to every corner of street he could find which had even the tracest amount of Anarchist activity, and arrest those there without trial, silently removing them from the public eye, he also put curfews up, with an increased level of harshness against all enemies of the State.\n\nEventually, after two weeks of looking for this nameless, meaningless medium-level Anarchist which kept attacking our good orderly policemen and ruining our infrastructure, we found him, hiding in the home of a family in Bordeaux. Of course, we arrested all of them and did away with their records, ensuring they were never found again. Even if we all lose and fall to reactionary forces, at least the vile enemies of our people will never have existed."
comfrance.955.a: "No tears, no pain."

comfrance.956.t: "The Plot Thickens..."
comfrance.956.d: "Whilst we are still recovering from the aftershocks of the Black Guard insurgency we also must deal with the issue of the Vanguardists. Whilst they may be Sorelian camarades they are no friends to Chief Bucard. Since losing the power struggle, Marcel Déat has scuttled off with his cowardly clique of sycophants to lick their wounds, we must not underestimate their villainy. Therefore recent reports have provided us with an excellent excuse to dispose of them...\n\nLoyal camarade, Jean Fontenoy, has provided Bucard with a detailed report on his belief that it was in fact Déat who was responsible for the attacks. The day of the assassination suspicious acitivites were conducted, legionaries were pulled to one said and diverted from their patrols, armed terrorists were allowed to slip threw the crowd with little resistance and most shockingly despite the close proximity Déat and Laval were miraculously left with minor injuries. Although we have no solid proof, this report is all we need to justify the removal of the Vanguardists."
comfrance.956.a: "Traitors to the revolution! Deal with them at once!"

comfrance.958.t: "Nouvelle Politique Économique"
comfrance.958.d: "After the Leninist takeover by the Jacobins, an effort was put into place to transition the economy from one based on Petit-Bourgeois concepts such as management and salary differentiation, to one based on focusing solely on the Communist future, and focusing only on making French society ready for that future. However, as with all things, a transition had to be put into place as not to put too much strain on the gentle proletariat as the transition was made. Thus, the Nouvelle Politique Économique, or NPE, was introduced as a means of slowly reducing Petit-Bourgeois Syndicalism by disbanding all dangerous and overly-powerful unions that have over 1,000,000 members, while keeping those that genuinely support the Worker."
comfrance.958.a: "Breaking the chains requires some transitions..."

comfrance.959.t: "The Liberty of Voilence"
comfrance.959.d: "In a quiet summer evening in Paris, as people sat and drank coffee along with some croissants, it appears chaos has reigned supreme. The Black Guard has violently purged and dissolved the Government, burning down the CGT building and demanding that the people reign supreme. As they violently purged the remaining holdouts, chaos was caused around Paris and in the countryside, Anarchist elements across the country backed by Makhno slowly began consolidating control, as paramilitaries fought with the remaining Black Guard Elements. The provisional Anarchist State collapsed in of itself, resulting in a complete vaccum of power. Riots rise up across France, resulting in pockets of complete lawlessness across the countryside and in extremely small areas the size of a neighborhood in the cities - as Makhno and his gang carefully diffuse the situation, saying that this is a true symbol of veritatious Anarchy; full of vitality, destruction, and explosions of creation and annihilation. Of course, none of this was planned, the chaos only took hold due to wide-scale resistance from former communards and Sorelians. As this happens, reporters around the world are horrified of the developments in France and look around at the situation in hiding, knowing they'd be killed or worse if they were to appear openly. Surrealists like André Breton and Antonin Artaud also openly endorse the chaos, seeing it as an extreme form of surreal theatrical expression in France, with Bréton saying: 'This is the absolute state of existence - this is total surreal automatism, beyond reason and beyond facts. We have liberated ourselves from the State...'"
comfrance.959.a: "...Now we must liberate ourselves from Reality?"

comfrance.960.t: "Black Guard Target the Banks"
comfrance.960.d: "In the streets of cities like Marseille and Paris, Calais and Dunkerque, fire rose up through the skies and burned marble buildings - as bombs and artillery fired against the preciously delicate buildings which represented capitalism for far too long and subsequently the reactionary and totalitarian forces of the Totalist Charter, and with it millions of dollars worth of property were wiped out and turned into ash that flew into the sky, making the sky gray and foggy. Subsquently, elements of the Black Guard which controlled Paris brought Makhno to a podium and stated the following:\n\n'Comrades! It has been an excellent day - for the longstanding institution of currency which opressed our dear Anarchy has been wiped out! Banks across our Commune which were for far too long functioning - decades ago at the hands of capitalists, and then at the hands of Sorelians - both reactionaries of course, were destroyed and turned into complete piles of dirt and ash! This fire represents a cleansing, one which the world hasn't seen since the Free Territory, and now we have liberated ourselves completely from every element of statist society. Freedom is at your hands!'\n\nThousands began clapping and cheering, mixed with rioting from other forces, and just after those few minutes of quiet and profound observation and listening, it appears the Anarchy has returned back to it's normal state."
comfrance.960.a: "But the banks are made of marble..."

comfrance.957.t: "The Black Mark of Europe"
comfrance.957.d: "The so called syndicalist ‘revolutions’ were nothing more than a power swap, from tyrannical capitalist bankers to tyrannical union bosses. The regimes of France, Britain and Socialist Italy are no better than the Kaiser, for at least the Kaiser is honest about his all-powerful position. Syndicalist ''democracy'' has been a misleading tool used to fool the workers of the world into locking their own chains, true freedom requires the abolishment of any power hierarchy. The Black Guard have finally achieved this goal, liberation from the state, liberation from slavery. Upon seizing Paris, the Black Guard denounced their former allies in Britain and Italy, declaring the Free Territory of France the enemy of all nations who enslave their broken populace. This zone of anarchy is now detached from the rest of the world..."
comfrance.957.a: "Freedom or death!"

comfrance.961.t: "Slaughter of the Sorelians"
comfrance.961.d: "With their leadership collapsed, the remaining Sorelian loyalists had no chance of launching a successful counter attack. The assassination of Valois was already a deadly strike at the heart of the Sorelian machine, the later bombings and killings only sealed their fate. Makhno’s fiery speeches had galvanised the working class into revolting against their masters, and no only few remain. Locked in chains as a symbol of their tools being used against them, the remaining Sorelian militant leaders break as they witness their regime crumble knowing their time has come.\n\nWith these last Sorelian leaders rounded up we must make the decision of how best to execute them, do we go for an efficient method or something more...explosive? After all the people are demanding a show..."
comfrance.961.a: "...fill their bodies with lead, make it quick."
comfrance.961.b: "...the crowd always loves a public hanging!"
comfrance.961.c: "...strap explosives to their naked bodies, lets have some fun!"

comfrance.962.t: "Makhnovia"
comfrance.962.d: "A creation like no other, the Free Territory of France or as it’s more commonly referred to, ‘Makhnovia’, against all odds still remains. Functioning not as a nation but a collection of fully autonomous communes and soviets united under the protection of the highly decentralised Black Guard. Whilst violence, pillaging and looting from rebels, holdouts and occasionally Black Guard militants still ravage the lands there has been development of a new society. When not firing on Sorelain bastards or themselves, communes trade and barter, a small step for any other society however with the collapse of all defining features of a nation this last remaining aspect of modern humanity continues. The only laws enforced are that of the Black Guard, although officially possessing no power, Nestor Makhno serves as the military defender of the Free Territory. His army is the only thing preventing other nations from taking advantage of the chaos and invading and whilst he rejects any title of leader he has become the national father of this new endeavour. As anarchy reigns so does Makhno."
comfrance.962.a: "Even anarchists require a leader."

comfrance.963.t: "Black Guard Disband The National Worker's State Military"
comfrance.963.d: "With the Sorelian governmental structure torn apart, the Black Guard have now focused their attention towards the military. Officially disbanding the Revolutionary National Worker’s Armed Forces and replacing it with the Black Guard, all field marshals and generals have either been forcefully removed from their position or shot. In response to this military loyalists attempted to garrison themselves in strongholds and resist the Black guard, a fruitless endeavour when their own soldiers turned their rifles towards each other. The engulfing chaos seems to have taken hold over even the most loyal soldiers, when responsibility for actions is removed people will quickly lose their sense of duty and unleash their true natural being.\n\nThe military of France is now composed of Black Guard militants under the command of prominent anarchist figures, with no official officers. These officers are democratically elected and have been provided with the freedom to act as they wish however they remain loyal to Makhno’s orders. When the time is necessary and Makhno must call upon his comrades to defend the workers of France, these warriors will rally behind the black flag!"
comfrance.963.a: "The boot of the general has been severed."

comfrance.964.t: "A Leader?"
comfrance.964.d: "One of the most important decisions we must first make is the position of ‘leadership’, we have already declared the Free Territory to be a leaderless anarchist society. We could fully commit to this and announce that officially there is no representative leader for the French people, this decision is supported by the prominent Illegalists within the Black Guard. However some, mostly Makhno loyalists, have proposed proclaiming Makhno the symbolic military defender of anarchy, a position that would lack any political authority however would acknowledge a form of hierarchy, even if such a position is only one of military necessity. A stance seen as hypocritical by some. It should be noted that even if we choose to have no leader, Makhno is still a beloved figure amongst the public and the most powerful man in France, his military might and political influence would certainly not disappear..."
comfrance.964.a: "No masters!"
comfrance.964.b: "Makhno is our symbolic leader!"

comfrance.965.t: "Return of the Illegalists..."
comfrance.965.d: "The Illegalists were a faction of anarchists prominent in France and Italy during the early 1900s, staunchly devoted to complete individualism. Inspired by both the theories of Max Stirner and militarism of anarchists like Albert Libertad and Ravachol. The movement would engage in criminal activities justified as individual rebellions against the state. Rejecting morality and legality, Illegalists saw crime as a pursuit of one’s own desires and individuality.\n\nWith the totalitarian regime of the Sorelians, this strand of anarchism that is seen as radical even by anarcho-syndicalists has resurfaced amongst workers wishing to rebel against the National Workers State. Notorious anarchist Nestor Makhno, himself has begun to slightly drift towards Illegalism. Witnessing the failures of his anarcho-communist comrades in Ukraine and the failure of anarcho-syndicalists in both the Travailleurs and Anarchistes to prevent the rise of the Sorelains, the ideas of the complete abolition of hierarchy and use of crime has been seen by Makhno as nescessary to free France. There are even rumours that members of the notorious Bonnot Gang not only survived their infamous shoot-out, but have been advising Makhno as prominent Black Guard lieutenants..."
comfrance.965.a: "Stop right there criminal scum!"

comfrance.966.t: "The National Worker’s State!"
comfrance.966.d: "The Commune of France succeeded in overthrowing the decaying French Third Republic, for that we acknowledge the merits of the Syndicalist regime. However in recent times the status-quo of Syndicalism has led to weakness, with Valois now in control the revolution can be continued! The Commune will be reborn as the French National Worker’s State, a nation that values strength and labour, a nation that can reclaim the glories that we lost after the Weltkrieg.\n\nOne of the first changes we must make is the new flag, shall we raise the Sorelian inspired Commune flag or the banner of the Revolutionary Legion..."
comfrance.966.a: "...raise the Sorelian Commune flag!"
comfrance.966.b: "...raise the Revolutionary Legion flag!"

comfrancegamelin.1.t: "Crackdown on the Jacobins"
comfrancegamelin.1.d: "After the traitorous PCF regieme and it's leader Maurice Thorez were ousted by General Gamelin and Comrade Blum, there are still many enemies within our country who support the disgusting ideas of a the totalitarian, Leninist system! We must show them that we don't tolerate such dangerous ideas, but how should we do that? Should we take a harsh approach on the remaining Jacobins held in custody, have them persecuted by the police and punished with brute force, or should we show mercy and sentence them to serve their time then attempt to reintegrate them into society?"
comfrancegamelin.1.a: "No mercy! Hunt down the traitors and shoot them!"
comfrancegamelin.1.b: "Round them up and sentence them to serve time in our prisons!"

comfrancegamelin.2.t: "Preparation for the Jacobin Trials"
comfrancegamelin.2.d: "Now that the new government has taken the first steps towards stabilization, it is time to call the Jacobin leadership to account for their betrayal of the commune! The Front Populaire, in consultation with the Supreme Court, has issued summonses for all prominent Jacobin politicians to attend a large-scale trial that seeks to determine the punishment for their betrayal. It has already been decided in advance that the leader of the Jacobins, Maurice Thorez, should be given a separate trial to personally decide his fate. It was also decided that the process for the other leaders should start as soon as possible."
comfrancegamelin.2.a: "Nobody is above the law!"

comfrancegamelin.3.t: "The Trials"
comfrancegamelin.3.d: "After a short preparation time, the day of the trial has arrived. There were over a dozen other defendants in the dock, along with well-known politicians and officers such as Jacques Duclos and Marcel Cachin, who were waiting for awaiting their verdict. The process spanned several days, filled with dramatic speeches by the defendants and courageous lectures by prosecutors. After all the defendants had finally been heard, the court withdrew for consultation for a further day after completion of the taking of evidence. The tension was virtually unbearable as the hour came for the verdict. The Supreme Judge began his speech to announce the verdict and it read ..."
comfrancegamelin.3.a: "...Hang those found most responsible, the rest shall be sentenced to life imprisonment."
comfrancegamelin.3.b: "...Lifelong imprisonment! Keep those traitors in chains forever!"

comfrancegamelin.4.t: "The trial of Maurice Thorez"
comfrancegamelin.4.d: "A week ago, the other Jacobin leadership were sentenced by the court for their actions and now the head of this corrupt tyrannical clique will face an even worse fate. Maurice Thorez, chairman of the PCF and traitor to the commune, has now been brought to trial. The reading of all charges took more than two hours, and the subsequent trial took more than three days until the court closed the case and withdrew for the verdict. On the following day the verdict was finally announced. The court dismissed a life sentence because of the gravity of offenses and instead imposed the death sentence by firing squad. Throughout the trial,Thorez sat calmly without any emotion and did not say a word, and when he was given the final word after the sentence was pronounced, he said nothing and stared straight ahead. After that, the audience in the hall and the people in front of the courthouse broke out into thunderous jubilation.  Throughout France, citizens celebrated the end of the treacherous dictator. The following day at exactly six o'clock in the morning, the death sentence was carried out in public with Thorez blindfolded and tied to a post, whereupon cheers and applause broke out as the bullets lef the barrels of the firing squad. And so ended the failed Jacobin reign of terror in our nation."
comfrancegamelin.4.a: "Mort au traître! Vive la France!"

comfrancegamelin.5.t: "Declare Martial law!"
comfrancegamelin.5.d: "If we wish to restore order and stability our country, we have to declare martial law and expand the executive powers of the government. The Front Populaire will govern the nation and lead the reformation whilst the military under Maréchal Gamelin will assure the populace remains under control. While this will ensure that we have more room to act and that we can enforce our reforms, this won't be popular within the population which fears that we might become the very thing we swore to destroy..."
comfrancegamelin.5.a: "Do it! We have no other choice!"

comfrancegamelin.6.t: "Gamelin's Proclamation"
comfrancegamelin.6.d: "'My comrades! My friends! Today marks the day every Frenchman breaks the chains that have held him captive to this day! The traitorous machinations of the Jacobins were stopped and the syndicalist-democratic process in our country was restored! The heroes who willingly gave their lives for our freedom will never be forgotten and go down in history as heroes of the Syndicalist Revolution! But the smashing of the PCF alone is not enough to secure our country and the revolution, there is still much work to do! The reform plan that I and my government have prepared contains three core projects that we will implement in the coming years! 1. Strengthening the democratic process in the Commune through far-reaching reform of electoral law, the education system and the implementation of a large-scale anti-corruption campaign! 2. The consolidation of the Communard Spirit which forms the basis of our country, as well as the strengthening of the syndicalist way of life! And finally 3. The reform of the military and police forces to be able to better defend ourselves against internal dangers such as the PCF in the future, as well as against external threats such as our archenemy, the German Empire! Once this plan has been put into action, the commune will rise and shine in new splendor! Vive la révolution! Vive la Fédération des Communes de France!'"
comfrancegamelin.6.a: "On to a brighter future! Vive la France!"

comfrancegamelin.7.t: "Gamelin Establishes the Milice française"
comfrancegamelin.7.d: "Although the military are currently doing their best to restore order there simply is not enough soldiers to patrol the entire nation, therefore Gamelin has decided to establish a volunteer militia. The Milice française, or just simply ‘Milice’, are to be a paramilitary tasked with combating any remaining Jacobin resistance, as well as any potential opposition from other problematic groups. Dressed in blue paramilitary uniforms with a recognisable beret, they are to be armed and trained directly by the armed forces in order to act as a disciplined force. The Greek letter, gamma, has been chosen for its symbolism representing rejuvenation and energy. A fitting logo for a force that will aid Gamelin in re-energising the Commune."
comfrancegamelin.7.a: "Fitting indeed."

comfrancegamelin.8.t: "Léon Blum Appoints His Cabinet"
comfrancegamelin.8.d: "Prior to the Jacobin reign of terror, Léon Blum was not perceived by many as the future leader of the Travailleurs. As Faure’s health declined a battle arose between Léon Jouhaux and Benoît Frachon, Blum on the other hand was a minor figure in this clash for leadership. However the Jacobin’s attempted purge of CGT politicians left many Travailleurs to go into hiding, in a prison cell or dead, it was during this time of turmoil that Blum emerged. Uniting his comrades with the Anarchistes, Sociaux-Démocrates and Gamelin’s syndicalist aligned military he formed a united front to oppose Thorez.\n\nNow as head of government, serving as leader of the Commune under the protection of Maréchal Gamelin, he is tasked with forming a government to maintain the unity of the Front Populaire. Blum has already proven himself a successful man of action and capable of forming relations with political opponents, however without the threat of the Jacobins it will be a difficult task to keep the Front whole."
comfrancegamelin.8.a: "Camarade Blum will heal the wounds of the nation!"
