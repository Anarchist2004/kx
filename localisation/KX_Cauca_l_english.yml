cau.300.t:0 "Our Second Language"
cau.300.d:0 "Controlling language is one of the keys to unlocking complete power. Recognising this, we have issued an important decree in regards to the official language of our new state, which has become a delicate topic to say the least.\n\nAll other tribes and their native tongue were considered, except for the Tayronas who are still adamant in continuing their isolation. The most promising are the Wayuu, who speak Wayuunaiki and are located in the North-East region of La Guajira, since they are by far the largest group on the list. Furthermore, they are renowned for being one of the very last tribes to be conquered just after Venezuela had seperated from Gran Colombia. Secondly are the Senú, also called Zenú, located halfway between Medellin and Cartagena, whose native tongue was lost to them many years ago by fault of the Conquistadors - the main reason, as we suspect, to their advocacy of keeping Spanish as a second language. Lastly, there are the Muisca who originate near Bogota and speak Chibcha. Despite being a rather small group, someone had pointed out that they were nonetheless the most important and most well-known natives in the eyes of foreign nations worldwide - to choose them would probably legitimise our state greatly internationally and internally. The question is clear; which tongue should we pick as our official second language?"
cau.300.a:0 "We stand stronger together - Wayuunaiki."
cau.300.b:0 "It wouldn't be difficult to stick with Spanish."
cau.300.c:0 "Chibcha. Muiscas will legitimise our cause."
