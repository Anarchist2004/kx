POLITICS_CHARLES_MARX_DESC:0 "After completing his medical studies in the Commune of France and a brief stint practicing there, Charles Marx, convinved socialist returned to his native Luxemburg. There, with secret French funding, Marx founded a hospital, secretly using it to spread socialist ideas among patients and the medical community. Indeed, it was his hospital where Luxemburg's syndicalist party was secretly founded. With Luxemburgish independence restored, and under a socialist government no less, the party appointed Marx as head of state."

### Focuses ###
### Focuses ###
LUX_frog_occupation:0 "French Occupation"
LUX_frog_occupation_desc:0 "With their victories on the Western Front, the French Syndicalists have come to ‘liberate’ our beautiful nation from so-called ‘corrupt and reactionary’ German rule. Despite our nation’s democratic decision following the Weltkrieg to join the Kaiserreich, it would seem that we have been robbed of this mandate, and now find ourselves autonomous but occupied under Paris. With the arrival of General Henri Tanguy, ‘Déi Lénk’ has risen to national prominence, and it would seem that Luxembourg - whether the masses like it or not - will soon be a Socialist nation."
LUX_drive_out_german_influence:0 "Drive Out German Influence"
LUX_drive_out_german_influence_desc:0 "With the arrival of the Internationale occupation, our new allies have seen it fit to remove all German influence within Luxembourg. Given our long-held ties to the Kaiserreich and the degree of Germanification our culture and society have undergone, this shall be no small feat. Our new benefactors must be careful how far and how fast they push, however, for even now the wolves circle their new government."
LUX_re_establish_identity:0 "Re-Establish a National Identity"
LUX_re_establish_identity_desc:0 "What it means to be a pure and independent Luxembourger has been muddied, for we have been tied to Berlin and the Rheinish Germans for quite some time. Our provisional government has moved to revive the Luxembourgish identity, bolstered now by social nationalist and civic nationalist ideas from Paris. We shall take back what it means to be a Luxembourger!"
LUX_new_nation_new_politics:0 "New Nation, New Politics"
LUX_new_nation_new_politics_desc:0 "The Luxembourg that stands ‘independent’ today is a far-cry from its past self. With the monarchy deposed and with the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress now in temporary command, our nation has been radically changed - for better or for worse. Now it is up to the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress vun Lëtzebuerg to decide the fate of our newly crimson state."

LUX_soc_victory:0 "Luxembourg’s Crimson Dawn"
LUX_soc_victory_desc:0 "With guidance from General Tanguy and his attache from Paris, the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress vun Lëtzebuerg has heralded a new destiny for Luxembourg. A new people’s republic has been founded over the ashes of the old Duchy, and now our new state is ready to tackle the rigors of state-craft. Soon, Tanguy and his men will be a distant memory as we take our first independent steps into this new wide and Red world. As our first elections are prepared, we begin to take our new destiny in stride!"

LUX_synd:0 "Marx’s SPL"
LUX_synd_desc:0 "Following tense elections within the Kongress, Louis Charles Marx has been elected as the first President of our red republic. Serving as the face of ‘Déi Lénk’ and as the most widely respected Socialist in the nation, Marx was the favorite to win. Now as leader of our nation, Marx shall guide both the Syndikalist Partei vu Lëtzebuerg and the wider country as a whole on the long road to achieving true Syndicalism."
LUX_trade_unions:0 "Towards Syndicalism Through Unionism"
LUX_trade_unions_desc:0 "In order to rally the people and prepare them for true Syndicalism, we will have to dip their toes in it first. By expanding unions to every industry in the nation, and by making them voluntary at first, we shall slowly raise membership through honest practices and tempting incentives as we seek to fully unionize the nation. Only through total unionization can our nation be truly free, democratic, and equal."
LUX_german_compromise:0 "Language Compromise"
LUX_german_compromise_desc:0 "Until our integration into Germany, the only national language was Luxembourgish. However, with our admittance into the Kaiserreich, German rose to be a national language as well, only to be replaced by French with the rise of our revolution. Though all three languages have long been used in Luxembourg, it has always been a point of tension, but Marx has seen a solution. By allowing all three languages to hold equal status within the nation, we shall appease everyone at once, placing us on track to reduce ethnic tensions across the nation."
LUX_national_medical_system:0 "Win Over the Masses with Healthcare"
LUX_national_medical_system_desc:0 "Syndicalism still stands as a foreign and feared movement to many within the nation, even among our Leftist allies. Fearing complete societal reorganization and bloody redistributions, the masses need to be put at ease for now until we are in a position to pursue our more radical goals. With the war leaving many sick and wounded, it would be ideal to create a national healthcare service to provide free medical care to all citizens of our republic. By using this program as a goodwill tool, we shall win over the citizenry through medicine and bandages while we slowly reform society around them."

LUX_internationale_tourist_hub:0 "The Tourist Trap of the Internationale"
LUX_internationale_tourist_hub_desc:0 "Luxembourg is the new crimson pearl of Western Europe - a beautiful slice of the Old World that has long stood as a popular tourist destination. With the famous wineries, castles, and natural scenery of our nation now beyond the Red Curtain, it would be wise to advertise them to the rest of the Internationale. We shall become the tourist trap of the proletariat, and use this drummed-up business to bolster our economy."
LUX_nationalize_wine_industry:0 "Nationalize the Wine Industry"
LUX_nationalize_wine_industry_desc:0 "Luxembourg is famous for its rich, fertile soil and immense mineral wealth for such a small nation, but none of our produce is as famous as Luxembourger wine. By collectivizing and nationalizing the vineyards and wineries across the nation and putting them under governmental supervision, we shall increase the output of these historic establishments while bringing the profits to the people. All mouths in the Internationale shall be able to taste our exquisite wine, no matter their standing!"

LUX_radsoc:0 "Rasquin’s LSAP"
LUX_radsoc_desc:0 "Maneuvering past his political rivals, Michel Rasquin and his Lëtzebuerger Sozialistesch Aarbechterpartei has won the first post-revolutionary elections. Standing as a coalition of various moderate and fringe Socialists, Social Democrats, and Democratic Socialists, LSAP preaches for slow, steady, and purely democratic reform to bring true Socialism to Luxembourg. With Rasquin being sworn in and with his coalition behind him, the nation shall soon bear witness to his radically progressive ideals."
LUX_national_coalition_govt:0 "Bolster the Grand Coalition"
LUX_national_coalition_govt_desc:0 "Rasquin’s electoral, and now professional, success relies entirely on the Grand Coalition. Already containing everything from Anarchists to Social Democrats, Rasquin seeks to take this a step farther for the good of all Luxembourgers. By offering an olive branch to any and all republican and democratic elements within the nation that agrees to renouncing any and all ties with Germany, Rasquin hopes to win-over a large enough portion of the political scene to no longer need to worry about factionalism or reactionary tendencies. With many progressive and liberal politicians already stepping forward to join this enlarged big-tent group, it is sure to ensure political stability for years to come."
LUX_language_unity:0 "Unity Through Language"
LUX_language_unity_desc:0 "Eschewing ideas of bias and non-conformity, Rasquin’s LSAP has proposed a new bill to finally solve the language issue. Until our integration into Germany, the only national language was Luxembourgish, with German later rising to be another national language with our annexation, only to then be replaced by French with the rise of our revolution. This has caused a great deal of ethnic and cultural tension within the nation, and to solve it, Rasquin has decided to return to the old status quo. Soon, only Luxembourgish will be the accepted national language once again. With this one and united language, we shall forcibly make our nation one and united as well, for the good of all Luxembourgers."
LUX_working_class_identity:0 "Uplift the Working Class Hero"
LUX_working_class_identity_desc:0 "The common man is the backbone of our nation. On their shoulders, our revolution was carried to victory, and in their hands, our new destiny lies. We should all aspire to be like these heroes of Luxembourg, for each and every single one of them - from the simple labourers and factory workers to the industrious miners and refinerymen - contribute to the heart and soul of our new people’s republic. The new Luxembourgish man shall model themselves in the image of these simple heroes as we craft our culture into one fitting for the noble peasants and and wondrous workers we now aspire to be."

LUX_tot:0 "Urbany’s RSP"
LUX_tot_desc:0 "Astounding many, the self-called ‘Trotskyist’ and Internationalist Dominique Urbany has come out on top in the Kongress, and now leads Luxembourg with his Revolutionär Sozialistesch Partei. Under the RSP and Urbany, Luxembourg shall now be painted a deep crimson as Urbany drives the nation towards Internationalist Maximism based upon the Totalist Charter and the ideas of Tukhachevsky and Trotsky. With Urbany at the helm, Luxembourg shall play its part in the World Revolution, but until then, our focus should be on building up Totalism in one nation first - our nation."
LUX_planned_cities:0 "Plan Out Our Utopia"
LUX_planned_cities_desc:0 "Seeking to improve quality of life and efficiency, a new urban development plan has been drafted by Urbany and his associates in the RSP. This new plan, called ‘,’ seeks to link the twelve noble cities of Luxembourg into one massive urban sprawl. The idea calls for Luxembourg itself to be consumed by a concrete jungle with Luxembourg City at its core, built in modernist and futurist styles borrowed from the Internationale, linked together with cutting-edge mass transit systems, and dotted with cultural and natural sites to preserve beauty and function. This new plan will possibly take decades to complete, but like all great projects, you have to break ground sometime, so why not now?!"
LUX_ban_germ_language:0 "Fierce Anti-Germanism"
LUX_ban_germ_language_desc:0 "Reviling anything Germanic or Teutonic in origin, Urbany and his RSP have virtually declared war on ‘Germanism.’ Outlawing their language, their literature, their films, their art, their cuisine, and anything else having to do with that damnable nation, Urbany’s regime will stop at nothing to completely de-Germanize Luxembourg. With anti-German crimes and assaults becoming common, and even endorsed by the state, Luxembourg will give over fully to its nationalist and pro-French ties, replacing all sources of German influence with either Luxembourgish or French sources instead."
LUX_internationalism:0 "Beacon of the Word Revolution"
LUX_internationalism_desc:0 "Following Urbany’s initial successes at bringing Totalism to Luxembourg, he has moved to proclaim the World Revolution. Calling upon all Socialist movements across the world to rise up and break their chains together, Urbany has begun to set up Luxembourg to be the beacon of this new world. Though many do not seem keen on answering the call, even with our own nation, Urbany has carried on regardless, and has begun making plans for Luxembourg to take on the world if it must if that means the Dictatorship of the Totalist Proletariat can finally be established. Totalists of the world, unite!"

lux.1.t:0 "Occupation of Luxembourg"
lux.1.d:0 "With our victories against Germany on their Western flank, we have come to control the area of Luxembourg. With our decision to not annex this plot of land, but instead to create an autonomous Socialist Republic there, General Henri Tanguy has been sent to administer the provisional government until a local Trade Union Congress can be established to organize elections. We wish Tanguy well on his new endeavor, and we shall watch this new Socialist Luexmbourger state with great interest."
lux.1.a:0 "Another red pearl to add to our collection!"
lux.1.b:0 "Nous voulons rester ce que nous sommes! (Play as Luxembourg)"

lux.100.t:0 "A Crimson Dawn for Luxembourg"
lux.100.d:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles and a quick democratic referendum, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg joined the Kaiserreich as its newest constituent state. With the beloved Marie-Adélaïde remaining on her throne as Grand Duchess, Luxembourg took their new national situation in stride, and reaped the benefits of integration with Germany immensely. \n\nOver the following decades, much changed for the Duchy. The Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde died in 1924, and was replaced by her sister Charlotte. Furthermore, Luxembourg was rapidly industrialized, aided by its rich local iron and aluminum deposits, even rising to become the seat of illustrious and wealthy German industrial firms such as Deutsch-Luxemburgische Bergwerks-und Hütten-AG and Vereinigte Stahlhütten Burbach-Eich-Düdelingen, which fueled the nation’s rapid growth and brought even greater wealth to its people. However, this industrialization became a double-edged sword, for Socialist and Social Democratic ideals became popular in the region among the masses of factory workers, and with the start of the Second Weltkrieg, pro-Internationale militias and resistance groups were a common sight. \n\nFollowing the war, Luxembourg now finds itself under new management - made an autonomous socialist republic under the watch of a French-led occupational force commanded by General Henri Tenguy. General Tenguy, nicknamed Rol-Tenguy during his time aiding the Socialist Resistance in Luxembourg during the war, now leads the provisional government until the newly established Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress vu Lëtzebuerg - or Syndicalist Trade Union Congress of Luxembourg - can fully organize a new administration and first elections. However, with monarchist elements still loyal to the Grand Duchess, republican resistance guided by Pierre Dupong, and the pro-German ‘Volksdeutsche Bewegung’ all on the prowl and waiting for their moment to strike, it would seem this new red pearl of the Internationale is not as welcoming to their red ‘liberation’ as they thought it would be. With this tense political stage set, anything could be in the cards for this industrialized jewel of the Lowlands."
lux.100.a:0 "Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinn!"

lux.2.t:0 "The First Meeting of the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress"
lux.2.d:0 "With our new people’s republic established under the guidance of Paris and their watchdog General Tanguy, the time has come for our new legislative body - the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress vu Lëtzebuerg - to determine the fate of the nation. With only Socialist parties being allowed in the running, the race has been narrowed down to three main candidates. The face of the Kongress and of our nation’s Leftist movement itself is Louis Charles Marx, who leads the Syndikalist Partei vu Lëtzebuerg in line with traditional French Orthodox Syndicalism and has amassed much of the support of the congress. Opposing the SPL is Michel Rasquin’s Lëtzebuerger Sozialistesch Aarbechterpartei - or the Luxembourg Socialist Worker’s Party - which stands as a broad coalition of various Social Democrats, Democratic Socialists, and other moderates, and Dominique Urbany’s Revolutionär Sozialistesch Partei - an Internationalist party inspired by the Tuckachevky and the failed Trotsky. With each candidate standing in a decent position before the race, it is any man’s game. With the final delegates within the Kongress passing their votes, it would seem that..."
lux.2.a:0 "Charles Marx and his SPL triumphs for Orthodox Syndicalism!"
lux.2.b:0 "Dominique Urbany and his RSP seizes the nation for Internationalist Totalism!"
lux.2.c:0 "Michel Rasquin and his band of moderate Socialists in LSAP win out!"

lux.3.t:0 "Counter-Revolutionary Militias Organize"
lux.3.d:0 "The French have abandoned us, with General Tanguy and the last of his men pulling out and heading back home to Paris. In their absences, our meager Red Guard - itself nothing more than our resistance militias from the war rebranded - is all that stands in the way between our new red republic and the wolves that circle us even now. Wasting no time, numerous counter-revolutionary groups have already begun to organize. Among them are numerous different monarchists, republicans, and reactionaries who would all love nothing more than to see our people’s republic burn! Should we move out to crush these forces now before they can grow out of hand for our small military force, or shall we bide our time and reinforce - hoping that they do not strike while we are unprepared..."
lux.3.a:0 "Nothing to be alarmed about. We must focus on strengthening our own forces first."
lux.3.b:0 "Crush them, just to be safe."

lux.4.t:0 "Counter-Revolutionary Militias Attempt Coup"
lux.4.d:0 "With our decision to leave the reactionaries alone, they have only festered and grown in number, and now they have banded together to topple our people’s republic once and for all. With their unstable coalition unified against us, we have little hope to actually repel these rebels, but we must try anyway, for if not all that we have done here will be for nothing. With our backs to the wall and with our heads held high, we shall face these traitors of the Revolution! We shall be victorious, or we shall dine with our foes in Hell!"
lux.4.a:0 "Against all odds, we have repelled the reactionaries and saved our red republic!"
lux.4.b:0 "The Syndicalist dogs are driven from our home! Luxembourg is free!"

lux.5.t:0 "French Forces Pull Out"
lux.5.d:0 "With the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress solidifying its hold on the nation, General Tanguy and his occupational forces have announced their decision to return to France. Stating that the need for the provisional government is over now that the Kongress can stand on its own two feet, and ignoring rumors of the growing counter-revolutionary threat. Regardless of how safe and secure our new people’s republic truly is, the French are leaving anyway, and soon we shall be left alone to face whatever threats come our way..."
lux.5.a:0 "We didn’t need those guys anyway."

lux.6.t:0 "Reactionary Cells Attempt a Coup in Luxembourg"
lux.6.d:0 "News has come in from our puppet government in Luxembourg City reporting that counter-revolutionary elements have banded together in order to topple the infantile people’s republic we set-up there following our victory against Germany. Though we poured much time and investment into the ‘Luxembourg Project,’ with our current finances and military situation, it does not seem practical to once again try to prop up a government so clearly hated by its own people. However, these lost souls could just be trying to introduce Socialism all wrong, and they might just require our expert hand in the matter. Regardless, our decision won’t matter much in the grand scheme of our wider aspirations, for it is only Luxembourg..."
lux.6.a:0 "We cannot be bothered with something so trivial at a time like this."
lux.6.b:0 "Send Tanguy and his men back to the old Duchy!"

lux.7.t:0 "Luxembourg at a Crossroads"
lux.7.d:0 "Our counter-revolution has proven successful, with the vile Socialist regime meeting its fitting end at the edge of a rifle barrel. With our victory, some clemency has been offered to the more moderate Socialists - especially those among Rasquin’s NL - but for the large part, all other red traitors have been jailed or killed, with many more fleeing into exile in France. With these ruffians finally gone, the heroes and leading figures of our counter-revolution have come together to determine the fate of the nation. Holding a Kongress of their own in the grand hall of Schlass Fëschbech - or Berg Castle - these former enemies of the state now shall decide its future. Calling for the varied delegates - among them being pre-revolution politicians, military and resistance figures, nobility, and various other parties representing the Luxembourgish people. The two main camps of this debate have coalesced around the Grand Duchess Charlotte, who is supported by both avid monarchists and desperate republicans hoping to coax their sovereign into reintroducing democracy, and Damian Kratzenberg, a highschool teacher turned reactionary paramilitary leader who heads the viciously pro-German Volksdeutsche Bewegung. In the hands of one of these two groups, the future of Luxembourg lies. Now it is only up to the people to decide."
lux.7.a:0 "Standing upon her legacy, the Grand Duchess wins over her people."
lux.7.b:0 "The VdB’s popularity among the people carry them to victory."

lux.8.t:0 "The Question of Democracy"
lux.8.d:0 "With the post-revolutionary Kongress deciding that Grand Duchess Charlotte should remain upon her throne as a sovereign monarch, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has been reborn. Now, in order to move forward with our nation-building plans, a final decision must be made about the future of the nation. With her republican allies still clamoring for democracy, she could very well restore democracy to its fullest, stepping back as monarch and relegating herself to an entirely ceremonial role. However, though this would appease these republican sycophants, it would be a slap in the face to every other supporter of hers who joined her cause during the counter-revolution due to her undying devotion to Luxembourgish tradition. To appease these groups, and possibly even her own ambition, Grand Duchess Charlotte could instead push forward as planned to restore the balanced, modern parliamentary monarchy her people are used to. Alternatively, the Grand Duchess could even take this further given her current position of dominance, and push to consolidate all executive power within her hands as a true absolute monarch. Whatever her choice be now, all of Luxembourg and its destiny now lie solely within her hands."
lux.8.a:0 "Listen to our people and restore full democratic elections!"
lux.8.b:0 "Pay lip service to democracy while establishing a more modern monarchy."
lux.8.c:0 "All power shall lie within the hands of the Grand Duchess!"

lux.9.t:0 "Our First Post-Revolution Elections"
lux.9.d:0 "Listening to our pleas, the Grand Duchess has moved to reintroduce democracy back to the people of Luxembourg, finally allowing their voices to be heard. With this announcement, the head of our government-in-exile Pierre Dupong has moved to organize new elections. Drawing all the right-wing elements within the nation not already fallen in with the VdB, Dupong has reestablished the Rietspartei, or the Party of the Right, seeking to bring Chrisitan Conservatism and monitored Capitalism back to our state. Opposing him for support among the center and right is Eugène Schaus, whose newly remade Liberal Liga shares many of the same beliefs that the Rietspartei holds while strongly pushing for Classical Liberalism, Secularism, and a freer market instead. Opposing these two moderate groups is Marcel Cahen’s Radikal Liberal Partei, who stands for Progressivism, Secularism, and Social Capitalism. Finally, running as the dark horse candidate is Michel Rasquin, who since the counter-revolution has denounced his extremist views, purging his old LSAP of radicals and rebranding it as ‘Néi Lénk’ - or the New Left. Rasquin is still a dedicated Socialist at heart, but now champions for Social Democracy and moderate reformism over revolutionary action. With the parties set and the votes being counted, it's only a matter of time before our new national direction is determined through democracy,"
lux.9.a:0 "Pierre Dupong’s Rietspartei unsurprisingly takes the win."
lux.9.b:0 "Eugène Schaus’ Liberal Liga seizes the day."
lux.9.c:0 "Marcel Cahen’s Radikal Liberal Partei comes out on top."
lux.9.3:0 "Michel Rasquin’s reformed and de-radicalized Néi Lénk wins the day."
