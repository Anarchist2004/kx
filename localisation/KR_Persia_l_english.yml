### Events ###

pers.1.t:0 "Introduction to [PER.GetNameDef]"
pers.1.d:0 "In the past few decades, [PER.GetNameDef] has been in a state of constant change and instability. Having gained full independence from Russia and the British Empire, we have struggled to find our own place in this world. All around [PER.GetNameDef], from the smallest hamlet in the furthest corners of the nation to the big cities like [266.GetName], we can see the difference in beliefs between the people. Just a few years ago, the Shah himself was shot by a socialist assassin. Although he survived, the Shah's health has been declining by the day. It is clear the nation cannot survive like it is, and with the Shah's death looming, there are fears ideological divide could turn into open revolt. Democrats trying to force a republic, royalists who would support a powerful monarchy lead by the Shah's brother, Hassan Mirza, and socialists, attempting to create the first socialist state in the Middle East. We can only hope the power transition is peaceful...\n\nOur nation's military is in shambles, and we are still recovering from a famine that killed millions of our people. Not only that, our political class is dominated by a corrupt aristocracy, ruining our political legitimacy. Our nation has many problems to sort out, but if we can do it successfully, we could become the greatest Empire the Middle East has ever seen."
pers.1.a:0 "[PER.GetNameDefCap] will be strong!"

### Decisions ###

PER_coring_conquered_territory:0 "Integration of New Territory"
PER_core_afghan_land:0 "Integrate Herat"
PER_core_afghan_land_desc:0 "Now that we have gained control of our lands in Afghanistan again, we can begin to integrate it into [PER.GetNameDef]. However, it is going to take decades to fully intergrate the eastern area due to their Pashtun ethnic majority. In the west of Afghanistan, the population is majority Hazara, a group we can more easily integrate into our nation. The Pashtuns most likely will resist our attempts, but eventually they will accept our leadership."
PER_core_azerbaijani_land:0 "Intergrate Azerbaijan"
PER_core_azerbaijani_land_desc:0 "Azerbaijan is now under our direct rule again. After some time, most Azerbaijanis will give up on their dream of their own state, and will accept our leadership. Although there will be some resistance to our rule, we have a very large Azerbaijani minority, and the nation of Azerbaijan only existed for a few decades. Therefore, Azerbaijani resistance will be weak and futile."
PER_core_baluchistan:0 "Integrate Baluchistan"
PER_core_baluchistan_desc:0 "The state of Baluchistan has been returned to our control. The Baluchi people are a large ethnic group in our nation, so we should be able to integrate the Baluchi population fully into our state. However, they will resist our rule, due to the fact that they have been under Indian control for much time."
PER_ottos_are_weak_decision_category:0 "Western Expansion"
PER_ottos_are_weak_decision_decfision:0 "The Ottomans are weak!"
PER_ottos_are_weak_decision_decfision_desc:0 "Recently, Egypt has declared war on the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans have been dominating the Middle East for centuries, and now it is our moment to seek revenge. They have been showing weakness since even before the beginning of the first Weltkrieg, and now it is our time to put an end to the sick man that is the Ottomans."
PER_country_namechange_decision:0 "Change our name to Iran"
PER_country_namechange_decision_desc:0 "Pressure is mounting from modernizing elements within our nation to push for the international community to refer to us as "Iran", the name we use for ourselves, over the outdated exonym "Persia". Exactly why this is a matter of such debate, we're not really sure."
PER_IRAN:0 "The name of our country is Iran"
