SAF_weltkrieg_relics: "Relics of the Weltkrieg"
SAF_weltkrieg_relics_desc: "Our infantry's equipment is old, very old. Most of it has seen service during the Weltkrieg, and some sets have even seen action during the First Boer War. We must equip our army with modern gear, or else we will not stand a chance in another war."
SAF_upgrade_artillery: "Modernise the Artillery"
SAF_upgrade_artillery_desc: "South Africa's artillery mostly dates from the Weltkrieg. We must modernise our artillery unless we wish our soldiers to be eviscerated without proper support."
SAF_q_corps: "Q Services Corps"
SAF_q_corps_desc: "The Q Services Corps will be the centralised authority responsible for the logistics and supply of the permanent army. It will handle the distribution of oil, rations, ammo and uniforms. The work ahead of them is great, for Africa is a huge and hostile continent."
SAF_army_production: "Centralise Army Supply"
SAF_army_production_desc: "We will be recruiting a large number of soldiers. Manpower is not enough, however - we need the ability to produce massive amounts of guns for them to be effective."
SAF_military_college: "South African Military College"
SAF_military_college_desc: "South Africa should have a military academy modelled on the lines of the Preußische Kriegsakademie. This will give us a professional officer corps loyal to the Union, and rich of the knowledge of European military academies."

SAF_call_for_recruits_desc: "Our recruitment practices are outdated - it is time to revise them, and at the same time put out a new call for enlisted soldiers."
SAF_elite_force: "An Elite Force"

SAF_native_ncos: "Native NCO's"
SAF_native_ncos_desc: "While Natives are no stranger to serving in our nation's military, the efficiency of their units is often compromised by a lack of co-operation with the exclusively Afrikaner and British command. A campaign to promote Native NCOs should help better organise these units."
SAF_special_forces: "The SASF"
SAF_special_forces_desc: "Africa presents many extreme environments. Large, sprawling jungles. Endless deserts. Immense oceans surrounding it and wielding the world's trade. Huge, tropical rivers. We will need special divisions, ready to stop at nothing to escort our army forwards."

SAF_mobile_force: "A Mobile Force"
SAF_mobile_force_desc: "The quality of our forces do not matter half so much as their mobility. This is a new era. and tactics of encirclement and reach are far more vital to victory than ever before. This must be the focus on South Africa's military future."

SAF_armored_corps: "The Armoured Corps"
SAF_armored_corps_desc: "Designing tanks with the capacity to operate in African lands is no small task. One must not be fooled by the large prairies surrounding the Cape, those tanks will inevitably face desert and jungle as they advance northwards. European roads are far from here."
SAF_mech_production: "Natal Motorworks"
SAF_mech_production_desc: "All the research into armour will not help us at all if we are not able to build it - we must nationalise a prominent vehicle manufacturer and build it into the centre of our growing armoured production core."
SAF_mech_support: "Mechanised Support"
SAF_mech_support_desc: "Better vehicles are not enough. We must look to specialised units within our divisions whose primary purpose is to make our armour and mechanised forces more effective."

SAF_hartbees: "Improve the Hawker Hartbees"
SAF_hartbees_desc: "The Hawker Hartbees we have are not the most advanced fighters in the world, but we will make do. Improved mechanics and training will get the most out of these biplanes until we finally get the opportunity to replace them."
SAF_blenheim: "Replace the Blenheim"
SAF_blenheim_desc: "The Bristol Blenheim has been a serviceable light bomber for our airforce, but it may be time to find something sturdier, with a longer range that can cover the African wastes and jungles."
SAF_air_school: "The School of Aviation"
SAF_air_school_desc: "The first step in rebuilding our air force is the creation of an air academy, one which can train our future airmen for the battles to come."

SAF_air_defense_desc: "Our focus should not only be on taking to the skies, but on increasing our defence against those who would take to the skies against us."
SAF_air_production: "Invest in Aviation"

SAF_desert_air_force: "Desert Air Force"
SAF_desert_air_force_desc: "The desert skies are clear and the landscape forgiving, but the heat and sand means special attention is required to the mechanics of our aircraft. There are valuable skills to be learned in this unforgiving environment."
SAF_secure_cape: "Secure the Cape Sea Route"
SAF_secure_cape_desc: "Should the Suez Canal be blocked by conflict, the Cape will once again become the temporary gateway to the East. We must prepare to defend it at all costs from the navies of the great powers."
SAF_rule_the_skies: "Rule the Skies"
SAF_rule_the_skies_desc: "Our primary focus is on our air force - yes, this may come at the expense of our naval capabilities, but the Union must recognise where its strength lies and maximise its effectiveness."

SAF_tech_school: "Fund the Cape Town University"

SAF_state_security_desc: "Computers are the new realm in gathering information - and we must organise our state security programs to remain on top of this new front."
SAF_radio_africa: "Radio South Africa"
SAF_radio_africa_desc: "The development of radio allows us a means of expanding our communication across all of South Africa like never before. We must open up a new organisation to keep the public informed, as well as to facilitate the organisation of our frontline units."
SAF_expand_tech: "Expand Research Capacity"
SAF_expand_tech_desc: "With Black Monday behind us, the time has come to expand our research facilities - lest we fall behind the rest of the world and doom ourselves to become the backwater they already believe we are."
SAF_rocketry_focus: "Rocket Engines"

SAF_seaward_defense: "Seaward Defence Force"
SAF_seaward_defense_desc: "The Seaward Defence Force has served as our navy for two decades. Even as the crisis consumes our country, we should increase its funding. The Cape has always been vulnerable to attack without it and the protection of the British."
SAF_naval_academy: "The Cape Town Naval Academy"
SAF_naval_academy_desc: "It is not enough simply to have ships in our fleet - we must train our captains and admirals in the newest methods of naval warfare, to make each one of our vessels worth three of our enemy's."
SAF_submarine_focus: "Submarine Focus"
SAF_submarine_focus_desc: "Submarines are an excellent way to disrupt enemy convoys. We should construct as many as possible."
SAF_destroyer_focus: "Destroy Focus"

SAF_expand_simons_town: "Expand the Simon's Town Base"

### Decisions ###
SAF_reclamation_actions: "The African Reclamation Campaign"
SAF_reclamation_actions_desc: "Tally-Ho towards destiny, men! We move to retake the old lands of the fallen colonies across Africa for King and Country! We shall cleanse the land of Germanic taint and remove the Hun from the land. The Sun shall rise again on the British Empire..."

SAF_in_Zambia: "Restore Responsible Government in Northern Rhodesia"
SAF_in_Zambia_desc: "With Northern Rhodesia firmly controlled by Anglo forces, and the last of the Hun bastards dealt with, we may now move forward with setting up a more permanent administration in the region. As long as some of our bureaucrats remain in North Rhodesia to oversee the initial steps, we are confident North Rhodesia will prosper once more."

SAF_in_Namibiland: "Restore Responsible Government in Namibiland"
SAF_in_Namibiland_desc: "With the former lands of German Südwestafrika firmly controlled by our armies, and the last of the German holdouts being cleared away, our government has allowed for the creation of a permanent administration in the region. Though some in our government have their doubts given the large German minority in the area, we feel as though Namibland is ready for responsible governance...with Anglo oversight of course."

SAF_restoration_actions: "Matters of State in the Reclaimed Territories"
SAF_restoration_actions_desc: "Our conquests of the former British colonies in Africa have gone off without a hitch. We now control nearly half of the Dark Continent, and now must come the aftermath. With such large swathes of land quickly being conquered and placed under the control of our ever-straining bureaucracy, it is now time to determine what to do with these territories."

SAF_restore_Zambia: "Governance of Northern Rhodesia"
SAF_restore_Zambia_desc: "With the foundation of a new, Anglo-dominated colony in North Rhodesia, a new face for the colony must be chosen; one free of Germanic corruption. To this end, we must decide on a first Governor-General to lead the colony in these formative years."

SAF_restore_Namibiland: "Governance of Namibiland"
SAF_restore_Namibiland_desc: "With our conquest of Namibiland and the creation of a new civil administration, the time has come to select a head of state for the new colony. However, with its large German-speaking minority, the list of candidates that wouldn’t further worsen the delicate situation there is rather short. The top candidate is famous South African lawyer Johannes Van Rensburg, who has garnered a great deal of trust with the Namibiland Germans. Perhaps we should approach him."

SAF_in_Tanzania: "Restore Responsible Government in Tanganyika"
SAF_in_Tanzania_desc: "With Goering’s vile fiefdom being toppled in Tanganyika, Anglo boots finally conquered the heart of German Afrika. Now, with the last of Goering’s venomous influence being burned or shot out of existence, we now have the herculean task of restoring some semblance of reasonable government to this long tortured land. It shall be no easy task, but if anyone can do it, it is the mighty Anglo!"

SAF_restore_Tanzania: "Governance of Tanganyika"
SAF_restore_Tanzania_desc: "Now that we have created an initial structure of government that the locals will expand on, Tanganyika may now be ready to be ruled from a more local authority. To grant this, a new head of the colonial government of Tanganyika must be chosen, one who shall lead with strength as the colony is rebuilt."

SAF_in_Congo: "Intervening in the Congolese civil war"
SAF_in_Congo_desc: "News from Leopoldville! It seems the situation there has dissolved past any known peaceful recourse and the nation has devolved into civil war. We must send aid to our ally Governor-General Pierre Ryckmans and help him crush this madness at once!"

SAF_in_Kenya: "Intervening in the Mau Mau uprising"
SAF_in_Kenya_desc: "Urgent communique from Nairobi! The Mau-Mau uprising is in full swing, and the local Kenyan defense forces have so far been unable to decisively end the threat. With more and more native auxiliaries joining the revolt by the day, it is time for us to step in and crush these raving leftists once and for all."

SAF_in_Kikuyuland: "Restoring Responsible Government in Kenya-Uganda"
SAF_in_Kikuyuland_desc: "We have finally cracked the mountain stronghold that is the Kenyan highlands, and with it have taken full control of the former Kenya-Uganda colony. Though they fought with valor and bravery, the Kenyan defense forces were no match for our superior Anglo tactics. With these lands under our full control, we must now return civil governance to these lands. We shall take a lighter hand to their governance, however, as these rebels could have easily joined in Goering’s madness, but they instead denounced his vile ideas at every turn."

SAF_Kenyan_Traitors: "Restoring Responsible Government in Kenya-Uganda"
SAF_Kenyan_Traitors_desc: "The vile and backstabbing Kenyan-Ugandas had sided with Goering and his unholy fiefdom in the War for African Reclamation, and as such they will receive treatment fitting of traitors. We will allow the creation of a local governing administration, but we will make it very clear who is in charge. The locals of these lands lost their right to the velvet glove when they sided with the Hun. They will only know the iron fist."

SAF_in_Gabon: "Restore Responsible Government in Gabon"
SAF_in_Gabon_desc: "The French administration in Gabon has sent news today to the capital that they are in dire need of aid. They are besieged on all fronts by opportunistic foes, and from within rises the risk of leftist revolt. Their plea is dire, and they beg for our help. Shall we ride to Libreville to save our French allies?"

SAF_Gabon_Wakanda: "Restore Responsible Government in Gabon"
SAF_Gabon_Wakanda_desc: "Grave news has arrived from Libreville. Our French ally’s former colony of Gabon has fallen to syndicalist revolt! Even now, the red taint spreads from these lands and further infests the Dark Continent. We must move quickly to eradicate this virus before it can spread its vile ideas to the masses."

SAF_restore_Kenya: "Governance of Kenya-Uganda"
SAF_restore_Kenya_desc: "Our local government in Kenya-Uganda has achieved some semblence of law and order in the colony, despite any possible costs. With stability and control fully established, the colony is now ready for a new Governor-General to be chosen from our loyal cadre of local bureaucrats and officers."
### Events ###
saf.collapse.1.t: "Mittelafrika has collapsed"
saf.collapse.1.d: "Due to Göring’s rebellion and because of the mismanagement of Mittelafrika, their chain of command has broken down throughout the continent. Warlords and local rulers now hold more power in most areas than the German administration. The complex network of alliances that once made up Mittelafrika have been thrown into chaos, as the entire continent heads to war. The capital of Daressalam has been seized by Askari and mercenaries loyal to Goering, Südwestafrika has been seized by the local Schutztruppen and Westafrika hangs precariously in the balance of outside forces with the sudden collapse of German influence in the region. Meanwhile, our brothers in Kenya-Uganda, Nigeria and north Rhodesia are in peril. The Kikuyu have risen up against the Kampala government, loyalists in Nyasaland are locked in conflict with the German governor in Lusaka and the islamic northern territories of Nigeria have risen up in revolt. Across the former British colonial sphere, the emergency network of telegram beacons is lit. Africa calls for aid."
saf.collapse.1.a: "And Cape Town will answer."

saf.collapse.2.t: "Setting up the new North Rhodesian Government"
saf.collapse.2.d: "With the lights growing dim on the Dark Continent once again, we have found ourselves in a unique position to help create the newly rising post-collapse states that are organizing in the carcass of the Kaiser's old playground that was Mittelafrika. First of these new states is the former lands of our estranged Anglo brothers: the North Rhodesians. Two main plans exist for these old crown lands of the British Throne; one is to simply give these lands to the South Rhodesian administration, as the long history between the two groups could aid in integration. The other plan would be to create a newly-independent North Rhodesian state under their former head of state [N. Rhodie HoS], sending them aid as they create their new governmental apparatus. What plan shall we go with?"
saf.collapse.2.a: "Give it to South Rhodesia"
saf.collapse.2.b: "Create a new North Rhodesian administration under their former Head of State"

saf.collapse.3.t: "Setting up the new South-West African Government"
saf.collapse.3.d: "With the collapse of Mittlafrika, our small and isolated Germanic neighbors to the south west are looking ripe for the taking. So far from Berlin and with the Dar-es-salam government in shambles, the leaders of German South-West Africa have no choice but to submit to our might lest this harsh continent swallow them whole. This complete disaster has granted us the unique opportunity of creating a new Anglo-dominated South West African colony, and yet again we can revel in the collapse of the Kaiser's stolen empire."
saf.collapse.3.a: "Create a new South-West African administration, this time without Germanic taint."

saf.collapse.4.t: "Setting up the new Tanganyikan Government"
saf.collapse.4.d: "Tanganyika, like former German "Südwestafrika'' before it, was once one of the crown jewels of the Kaiser's now shattered Afrikan empire. With a far larger german-speaking minority spread across a much larger and more hospitable swath of land that was once the heart of the Mittelafrikan regime, this region will not be as easily subdued as the Southwesterners were. Regardless, the call of our destiny beckons us forth to demand the Tanganiyikans agree to mutually beneficial agreement of our own design. With their support diminished and chaos taking full reign, we offer these former subjects of the Kaiserreich amnesty for their aid and subordination in restoring order to the Dark Continent. Whether we shall let them reconnect with their "Südwestafrikan'' brothers or create for them an independent regime in its own right under the Rothschild’s care remains to be ironed out, but what is for certain is that the German's grip on this continent wavers regardless of outcome."
saf.collapse.4.a: "Give the lands to the Rothschilds"
saf.collapse.4.b: "Let's be sportsmanlike, Südwest can have it"

saf.collapse.5.t: "Contacing Leopoldville"
saf.collapse.5.d: "Next on our list for failed German ventures is the fabled Congo colony, whose economic output and resource wealth rivals that of some of the world's superpowers. Within those storied jungles and swamps lies some of the richest land on this Earth. Also nestled within these jungles is the colonial capital of Leopoldville where the colonial government currently argues with itself over the future of their lands with the recent collapse of Mittelafrika. We should get a hold of a direct line to Leopoldville to iron out a mutual agreement with their government on the future of their lands. Under South Africa protection, we will ensure to the Congolese that the rubber and money will continue to flow under our Anglo-led administration's oversight."
saf.collapse.5.a: "Get me Leopoldville on the line, we must ensure the rubber flows."

saf.collapse.6.t: "Help from the Congo"
saf.collapse.6.d: "With the Congo colony secured, it is now time to ask them to join us in our coming crusade to reclaim Africa back from the clutches of the Hun. Their possible involvement has predictably caused some debate in our parliament over the degree to which they should help us. The two main camps for Congo's intervention is to either have them supply resources, equipment, and other economic or military aid, or to have them fully commit to joining the Entente and standing with our forces side-by-side on the coming battlefield. Though both have their strengths, ensuring their entrance in the Entente now could save us from greater headaches down the line, but the final choice lies with our Prime Minister and his cabinet."
saf.collapse.6.a: "The Congolese join us in the Entente and on the frontline."
saf.collapse.6.b: "Just have them send aid, they need not spill blood for our conquest."

saf.collapse.7.t: "The War Cabinet"
saf.collapse.7.d: "With the post-collapse states being reorganized to the best of our ability and the troops armed and at the ready, it is now time to choose which brave soul will be the face of the nation and lead us through this coming crusade. The favorites-to-win amongst the candidates are our current Prime Minister, as well as famous author and professor J.R.R Tolkien, famed aviation hero Adolf "Sailor" Malan, and local politician and famed academic Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr. Who of these titans will be chosen to lead our nation in its darkest hour; who will be thrust into history as either the savior of British Africa or the Empire's last great failure?"
saf.collapse.7.a: "J.R.R. Tolkien"
saf.collapse.7.b: "Adolf "Sailor" Malan"
saf.collapse.7.c: "Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr"
saf.collapse.7.e: "Our current leader is fine"

saf.collapse.8.t: "Help from Gabon"
saf.collapse.8.d: "A private telegram has arrived from Libreville, which until recently was known as Tirpitzstadt. The message was sent by the now-free colonial government of Gabon who seek to join our illustrious alliance. That is, they *will* join if we agree to help them in their wars and respect their territorial claims to former Mittelafrikan lands. Such small concessions are nothing compared to the bounties we will reclaim if we win the coming reclamation war, and so Gabon will be sworn in immediately as the newest member of the Entente."
saf.collapse.8.a: "We welcome the people of Gabon into the Entente's embrace."

saf.collapse.9.t: "Setting up the new Kenyan-Ugandan Government"
saf.collapse.9.d: "The old colony of Kenya-Uganda was once the center of the British Empire in Eastern Africa. For too long has it languished under German control, becoming more and more dilapidated and misused with every new policy the Hun enacts. Due to their own sheer incompetence, the Hun has lost its grasp over the Kenyan highlands, and these lands beckon to be returned to Anglo hands. With the arrival of our initial delegation, we have gotten to work on restructuring the Kenyan-Ugandan administration. However, a new question has arisen: should the two colonies maintain their connection, or finally be severed into two, separate entities under Rothschilds’ supervision? Though two administrations are harder to maintain than one, the ethnic and cultural divides may be too great for a unified colony to survive. Ultimately, the choice lies with us."
saf.collapse.9.a: "Keep them together, Kenya-Uganada is indivisible!"
saf.collapse.9.b: "Split them up, and give the pieces to the Rothschilds"

saf.collapse.10.t: "The Central African Stage"
saf.collapse.10.d: "The lights are on, the stage is set, the hour we have all been waiting for is finally here: on this day, we march from the Cape of Good Hope deep into the Dark Continent to reclaim what the dastardly Hun stole from us over decades ago. By the time this coming bloodshed is finished, the Union Jack will fly from Cape Town to Dar-es-Salam, and from Libreville to Mombasa; with this the British Empire will be vindicated and reborn as the eternal Anglo takes his seat atop the world stage again. This is our moment, our final hour, our curtain call. We will partake on the righteous crusade and ensure that the sun never truly sets on our King's empire. For King and Country!"
saf.collapse.10.a: "It is time to reverse the setting sun; the Anglo's golden age has only just begun..."
