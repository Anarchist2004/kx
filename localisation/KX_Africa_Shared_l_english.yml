### Focuses ###

AFR_Nationalize_European_Companies:0 "Nationalize European Companies"
AFR_Nationalize_European_Companies_desc:0 "While direct European influence may have been banished from Africa (for the most part), they still sink their claws into our economies with their mining companies, robbing Africans of their wealth and continuing colonial practices; just in new clothing. We will never be truly free unless we are rid of these companies, they must be expelled. Africa’s economy must serve Africans first and always; not fat cats thousands of miles from our territory. "
AFR_Work_with_Foreign_Mining_Concerns:0 "Work with Foreign Mining Concerns"
AFR_Work_with_Foreign_Mining_Concerns_desc:0 "We can not deny that European companies provide an important lifeline to our economy; we can not afford to simply expel them. Instead we will work hand in hand with major corporations, helping with their extraction of natural resources in exchange for a cut. While the Europeans enslaved us and our people mere years ago,we have learned that profit can ease all misfortune. "
AFR_Forming_our_own_Economy:0 "Forming our own Economy"
AFR_Forming_our_own_Economy_desc:0 "The economies of Africa so far have been exclusively structured to support our former masters; but with them gone, we must adapt. The first step towards true de-colonization is the establishment of a truly African economy - an economy that can serve our people independently of european interests, and that can develop and expand at its own pace. "
AFR_Establish_Financial_Beuracracy:0 "Establish Financial Bureaucracy "
AFR_Establish_Financial_Beuracracy_desc:0 "We currently have no real widespread and unified financial system. What little we had that remained from the colonial regimes was obliterated in the chaos of the Mittelafrikan Collapse. Our financial bureaucracy will be built from the ground up as rapidly as possible in order to get the nation on the path to prosperity as quickly as possible, or at least keep us away from an economic meltdown.""
AFR_Tax_Collection:0 "Formalize Tax Collection"
AFR_Tax_Collection_desc:0 "The system of taxation in our territory is largely ad-hoc and unofficial, with local warlords taking unfair tribute for themselves. The first step towards financial stability is to establish a formal system of taxation, and formal tax codes for citizens. All taxation tied to the central government, and taxes collected will provide much needed funds for government projects. And while corruption in our systems is inevitable, strong codes and punishment for offenders will hopefully persuade officials away from the dishonest appropriation of funds. "
AFR_Foreign_Support:0 "Support from Abroad" 
AFR_Foreign_Support_desc:0 "While we have made great strides in economic development, we can not reach our goals by ourselves. To help us, we have called in a foreign benefactor, who will provide loans and funds to help further build up our economy; with our financiers getting a cut from all projects constructed from foreign loans. "
AFR_Roads_and_Rails:0 "Building Roads and Rails"
AFR_Roads_and_Rails_desc:0 "As it stands, the majority of Africa is mainly rural, disconnected areas, with roads and railways being few and far between. While this system worked fine for our colonial overlords, now that we stand independent we must move on from development schemes only meant to benefit our oppressors. We shall embark on the construction of roads, railways, canals and other infrastructure which shall connect our people to one another, and not just our valuable resources to European ports. "
AFR_Protect_Wildlife:0 "Protecting our Land and Wildlife"
AFR_Protect_Wildlife_desc:0 "Our nation is a beautiful and varied land; and as an oasis of general stability here in Africa, we could offer the people of the world a front row seat to Africa’s beauties and wonders without forcing them to confront the harsh reality and atmosphere of chaos that surrounds much of the continent. Tourism income shall become a new cornerstone of our economy."
AFR_A_Push_for_Tourism:0 "Towards a Tourism Industry"
AFR_A_Push_for_Tourism_desc:0 "Our wildlife is sacred. From the smallest hyrax to the largest elephants, the animal and plant life that form this beautiful ecosystem we live in are just as vital and important to our nation and our people as iron or air. Long have poaching, habitat destruction, and other vile practices sullied and tainted this Eden we call home. New protections shall be enacted and strictly enforced to ensure the wilds of our nation survive and thrive for generations to come."
AFR_First_Steps_towards_Industrialization:0 "The First Steps Towards Industrialization"
AFR_First_Steps_towards_Industrialization_desc:0 "While recently we have made great strides towards industrial self-sufficiency; there is still a long way to go. While soon our skies might soon be black with smog, we must focus on what our nation is rich in and invest the profits wisely. Soon our nation's march towards industrialization will enter its final chapters."
AFR_Expanded_Farming:0 "Support our Farmers"
AFR_Expanded_Farming_desc:0 "As of now we are a majority rural and agrarian nation; and while we have recently pushed to industrialized our lands, we must focus on the assets we have at our disposal currently. Our Farmers will remain a source of income for our people, selling the stocks of food not used to feed our people for a profit. In addition, we shall set up specialized agricultural courses so that new generations of farmers may till the land. "
AFR_Riches_of_Africa:0 "Tap into the Riches of Africa"
AFR_Riches_of_Africa_desc:0 "Africa as it stands is one of the most wealthy continents on the face of the planet; Europeans may have stolen our wealth for centuries, but now that Africans call the shots, the vast mineral and chemical wealth will be used to further our own economic development instead of the development of Europe. Veins of ore and oil rich areas will be exploited to their full potential, with every cent going right back to the pockets of African Citizens. "
AFR_Homegrown_Industry:0 "Our own Homegrown Industry"
AFR_Homegrown_Industry_desc:0 "Our recent pushes for industrialization are beginning to bear fruit. While our methods of industrialization are different from the methods of the rest of the world, they are methods nonetheless, and we have seen great success industrializing our own way and on our own terms. Soon we will have an economy on par with the great powers of Europe. "
AFR_Nationalize_Our_Infrastructure:0 "Infrastructure in the Government's Hands"
AFR_Nationalize_Our_Infrastructure_desc:0 "Privatization of vital infrastructure hasn’t done anyone any good, it has led to nothing but greedy exclusion and cut corners. We refuse to yield to major corporations in their demands for control, instead we will continue trusting our government to pass the benefits of our infrastructure down to the populace. "
AFR_Private_Control_of_Infrastructure:0 "Push to Privatize our Infrastructure"
AFR_Private_Control_of_Infrastructure_desc:0 "The populace has grown tired of failing public infrastructure, and the government has found it wise to listen. We shall hand control of major infrastructure over to private interests, trusting them with the construction and maintenance of vital infrastructure such as roads, bridges and railroads. Additionally, they will flip the bill for all of this, rewarding the citizenry with a well earned tax break. "
AFR_A_Booming_Economy:0 "A Booming African Economy"
AFR_A_Booming_Economy_desc:0 "Business is Booming! We have transformed our barren and plundered backwater into a flourishing haven of economic prosperity. Our people are rich, our lands are richer, and investors from around the world flock to get themselves a slice of the action. We have thrown off the legacy of economic oppression and have come out a powerful economic force that can rival even the greats. "
