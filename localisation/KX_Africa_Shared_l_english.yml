### Focuses ###

AFR_Nationalize_European_Companies:0 "Nationalize European Companies"
AFR_Nationalize_European_Companies_desc:0 "While direct European influence may have been banished from Africa (for the most part), they still sink their claws into our economies with their mining companies, robbing Africans of their wealth and continuing colonial practices; just in new clothing. We will never be truly free unless we are rid of these companies, they must be expelled. Africa’s economy must serve Africans first and always; not fat cats thousands of miles from our territory. "
AFR_Work_with_Foreign_Mining_Concerns:0 "Work with Foreign Mining Concerns"
AFR_Work_with_Foreign_Mining_Concerns_desc:0 "We can not deny that European companies provide an important lifeline to our economy; we can not afford to simply expel them. Instead we will work hand in hand with major corporations, helping with their extraction of natural resources in exchange for a cut. While the Europeans enslaved us and our people mere years ago,we have learned that profit can ease all misfortune. "
AFR_Forming_our_own_Economy:0 "Forming our own Economy"
AFR_Forming_our_own_Economy_desc:0 "The economies of Africa so far have been exclusively structured to support our former masters; but with them gone, we must adapt. The first step towards true de-colonization is the establishment of a truly African economy - an economy that can serve our people independently of european interests, and that can develop and expand at its own pace. "
AFR_Establish_Financial_Beuracracy:0 "Establish Financial Bureaucracy "
AFR_Establish_Financial_Beuracracy_desc:0 "We currently have no real widespread and unified financial system. What little we had that remained from the colonial regimes was obliterated in the chaos of the Mittelafrikan Collapse. Our financial bureaucracy will be built from the ground up as rapidly as possible in order to get the nation on the path to prosperity as quickly as possible, or at least keep us away from an economic meltdown.""
AFR_Tax_Collection:0 "Formalize Tax Collection"
AFR_Tax_Collection_desc:0 "The system of taxation in our territory is largely ad-hoc and unofficial, with local warlords taking unfair tribute for themselves. The first step towards financial stability is to establish a formal system of taxation, and formal tax codes for citizens. All taxation tied to the central government, and taxes collected will provide much needed funds for government projects. And while corruption in our systems is inevitable, strong codes and punishment for offenders will hopefully persuade officials away from the dishonest appropriation of funds. "
AFR_Foreign_Support:0 "Support from Abroad" 
AFR_Foreign_Support_desc:0 "While we have made great strides in economic development, we can not reach our goals by ourselves. To help us, we have called in a foreign benefactor, who will provide loans and funds to help further build up our economy; with our financiers getting a cut from all projects constructed from foreign loans. "
AFR_Roads_and_Rails:0 "Building Roads and Rails"
AFR_Roads_and_Rails_desc:0 "As it stands, the majority of Africa is mainly rural, disconnected areas, with roads and railways being few and far between, and with the majority of the transport of goods being handled by porters. While this system worked fine for our colonial overlords, now that we stand independent we must move on from development schemes only meant to benefit our oppressors. We shall embark on the construction of roads, railways, canals and other infrastructure which shall connect our people to one another, and not just our valuable resources to European ports. "
AFR_Protect_Wildlife:0 "Protecting our Land and Wildlife"
AFR_Protect_Wildlife_desc:0 "Our nation is a beautiful and varied land; and as an oasis of general stability here in Africa, we could offer the people of the world a front row seat to Africa’s beauties and wonders without forcing them to confront the harsh reality and atmosphere of chaos that surrounds much of the continent. Tourism income shall become a new cornerstone of our economy."
AFR_A_Push_for_Tourism:0 "Towards a Tourism Industry"
AFR_A_Push_for_Tourism_desc:0 "Our wildlife is sacred. From the smallest hyrax to the largest elephants, the animal and plant life that form this beautiful ecosystem we live in are just as vital and important to our nation and our people as iron or air. Long have poaching, habitat destruction, and other vile practices sullied and tainted this Eden we call home. New protections shall be enacted and strictly enforced to ensure the wilds of our nation survive and thrive for generations to come."
AFR_First_Steps_towards_Industrialization:0 "The First Steps Towards Industrialization"
AFR_First_Steps_towards_Industrialization_desc:0 "While recently we have made great strides towards industrial self-sufficiency; there is still a long way to go. While soon our skies might soon be black with smog, we must focus on what our nation is rich in and invest the profits wisely. Soon our nation's march towards industrialization will enter its final chapters."
AFR_Expanded_Farming:0 "Support our Farmers"
AFR_Expanded_Farming_desc:0 "As of now we are a majority rural and agrarian nation; and while we have recently pushed to industrialized our lands, we must focus on the assets we have at our disposal currently. Our Farmers will remain a source of income for our people, selling the stocks of food not used to feed our people for a profit. In addition, we shall set up specialized agricultural courses so that new generations of farmers may till the land. "
AFR_Riches_of_Africa:0 "Tap into the Riches of Africa"
AFR_Riches_of_Africa_desc:0 "Africa as it stands is one of the most wealthy continents on the face of the planet; Europeans may have stolen our wealth for centuries, but now that Africans call the shots, the vast mineral and chemical wealth will be used to further our own economic development instead of the development of Europe. Veins of ore and oil rich areas will be exploited to their full potential, with every cent going right back to the pockets of African Citizens. "
AFR_Homegrown_Industry:0 "Our own Homegrown Industry"
AFR_Homegrown_Industry_desc:0 "Our recent pushes for industrialization are beginning to bear fruit. While our methods of industrialization are different from the methods of the rest of the world, they are methods nonetheless, and we have seen great success industrializing our own way and on our own terms. Soon we will have an economy on par with the great powers of Europe. "
AFR_Nationalize_Our_Infrastructure:0 "Infrastructure in the Government's Hands"
AFR_Nationalize_Our_Infrastructure_desc:0 "Privatization of vital infrastructure hasn’t done anyone any good, it has led to nothing but greedy exclusion and cut corners. We refuse to yield to major corporations in their demands for control, instead we will continue trusting our government to pass the benefits of our infrastructure down to the populace. "
AFR_Private_Control_of_Infrastructure:0 "Push to Privatize our Infrastructure"
AFR_Private_Control_of_Infrastructure_desc:0 "The populace has grown tired of failing public infrastructure, and the government has found it wise to listen. We shall hand control of major infrastructure over to private interests, trusting them with the construction and maintenance of vital infrastructure such as roads, bridges and railroads. Additionally, they will flip the bill for all of this, rewarding the citizenry with a well earned tax break. "
AFR_A_Booming_Economy:0 "A Booming African Economy"
AFR_A_Booming_Economy_desc:0 "Business is Booming! We have transformed our barren and plundered backwater into a flourishing haven of economic prosperity. Our people are rich, our lands are richer, and investors from around the world flock to get themselves a slice of the action. We have thrown off the legacy of economic oppression and have come out a powerful economic force that can rival even the greats. "

AFR_An_African_Army:0 "An African Army"
AFR_An_African_Army_desc:0 "With the departure of colonial rule, Africa has been plunged into chaos and violence; the likes of which have never been seen before. As we try to survive the tumult that surrounds us, we must begin construct our own army, based off of the Askari and Colonial Garrisons that our former Masters have left behind."
AFR_Rehabilitare_the_Askari:0 "Rehabilitate the Askari Officers"
AFR_Rehabilitare_the_Askari_desc:0 "While the Askari may be considered traitors to some, they remain the core of Mittelafrika’s former army, and a vital resource for our fledgling new army to use. We shall re-train and re-arm the former troops that disbanded after their commanders fled, forming a powerful new core to our army. "
AFR_Scavenge_German_Guns:0 "Scavenge German Weapons and Designs"
AFR_Scavenge_German_Guns_desc:0 "The German Empire stands as a global hegemon and the most powerful of our former rulers. And while German overlords might have departed, they have left behind a myriad of guns, trucks, artillery, plans, schematics and other useful equipment. To further our mastery of warfare, we shall tirelessly study and re-purpose what was left behind, using the scraps at hand while laying the groundwork for making our own copies in the future. "
AFR_Foreign_Backed_Research:0 "Foreign Backed Research"
AFR_Foreign_Backed_Research_desc:0 "Almost a hundred years of colonial policies has led most of our high command clueless in the modern ways of war. Using manuals and books left behind by Germany, as well as European schools willing to accept our officers, we shall re-forge and re-train our army into an effective and modern fighting force. "
AFR_Lessons_of_Tradition:0 "Lessons of Tradition"
AFR_Lessons_of_Tradition_desc:0 "While their resistance may have ultimately been futile, we can not deny the passion of our forefathers who attempted to resist European Hegemony. Even today elders with memories of anti-colonial struggle remain, we must heed their lessons and incorporate traditional tribal methods of warfare into the fabric and structure of our Armed Forces, commiting to the modernization our method while maintaining an important link to the past. "
AFR_Mobilize_the_Villages:0 "Militarize Rural Villages"
AFR_Mobilize_the_Villages_desc:0 "The various villages, tribal kingdoms, and other small settlements that lie outside the major cities and across the countryside are a valuable and untapped asset we could utilize for our military’s gain. By offering incentives to volunteers from these population centers to join organized levees and militias, we could train the regular citizens of our nation to be able to rise up at a moments notice. By spreading this system across the entire nation, we could have an army of thousands ready to protect their nation at a moment’s notice. Every inch of our nation shall become the frontline as every volunteer rises, rifle in hand, to defend their home."
AFR_Bush_Warfare:0 "Bush Warfare"
AFR_Bush_Warfare_desc:0 "Africa is a harsh continent, with varied climates and terrains that stretch across its expansive mass. In [ROOT.GetName] and the surrounding areas, savannahs dominate the landscape with dense pockets of monsoon forest that border the North and South. These wild lands are known to our people, and thus our soldiers, just as well as they know how to breathe or run. We shall use this knowledge to form the basis of our new military doctrine. We shall become masters of the Bush itself."
AFR_Guerilla_Tactics:0 "Guerilla Tactics"
AFR_Guerilla_Tactics_desc:0 "With their deep knowledge of the local terrain and with the new tactics we have developed instilled deeply in their hearts and minds, our Defense and Security Forces have evolved into a fierce and ravenous fighting force. Each day, our militias raise from their volunteer’s barracks and drill the skills needed to defend our lands from any invader. With each drop of blood and sweat spilled, these Gabonese guerillas get one step closer to being the most feared fighting force in all of Africa!"
AFR_Victory_by_Any_Means:0 "Victory - By Any Means..."
AFR_Victory_by_Any_Means_desc:0 "Despite our modernization - Africa’s army remains archaic and not suited to European standards of warfare. While many have called this a detriment, we call it a strength. We will embrace asymmetrical warfare to its highest extent, focusing on winning our conflicts no matter how dire the price may be. "
AFR_Napalms_Aroma:0 "Napalm's Aroma"
AFR_Napalms_Aroma_desc:0 "You smell that? That’s napalm, and nothing else smells like it in the world. Requisitioned from some French friends to the North, we have been able to quietly purchase and import tons of this vitriolic compound for use against any foe foolish or daring enough to step foot past our borders without our approval. They can not run, and they can not hide, for we shall burn the jungles they scurry away too like the vermin they are as we turn the very sky red with our ordinance."
AFR_Hire_Mercs:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
AFR_Hire_Mercs_desc:0 "Mercenaries have been used in warfare ever since European feet stepped foot on African soil, providing their services as soldiers in exchange for monetary compensation. Who are we to break this tradition? The Soldier of Fortune business has been booming ever since the German administration fell, and we are happy to be their newest customers. With them on our payroll we will crush our enemies with our fierce and well trained bands of hired militants. "
AFR_The_Gift_of_Gas:0 "The Gift of Gas"
AFR_The_Gift_of_Gas_desc:0 "Hermann von Göring’s administration had secretly stocked up on nocuous substances such as Mustard and Chlorine gas under the the Kolonialbüro’s nose, in case of a mass uprising or other such event. While Göring’s men retreated from our lands before they had a chance to use it, these toxic substances have been sitting in store, unused by our government in an attempt to avoid stooping to the level of Göring and his lackeys. However with the fate of our nation on the line, and with seemingly no other option left, [ROOT.GetLeader] has authorized the use of gas weapons in the battlefield, in blatant violation of the previously established rules of war. May god have mercy on our souls... "

AFR_Repair_Old_Planes:0 "Repair Leftover Aircraft"
AFR_Repair_Old_Planes_desc:0 "Hermann von Göring; while proving to be instrumental in the downfall of Mittelafrika, was also an avid pilot and collector of planes and other aviation equipment. His vast collections of aircraft now lie abandoned in the various airfields scattered across the African terrain, doing nothing besides collecting dust. Repairing these old birds and getting them back in the sky will be vital for protecting our skies. "
AFR_Hire_Foreign_Pilots:0 "Hire Foreign Pilots"
AFR_Hire_Foreign_Pilots_desc:0 "We have a critical lack of pilots for our small yet fierce air force; contributing to a systematic problem within our forces: a lack of experienced and well trained officers. To remedy this, we shall move to hire foreign pilots, getting men in the cockpits of our aircrafts while also helping to train a new generation of African Airmen. "
AFR_Utilize_Airports:0 "Utilize Abandoned Airports"
AFR_Utilize_Airports_desc:0 "The collapse of Mittelafrika led to the abandonment of many facilities used by the armed forces of the old regime. Scattered along the African plains are several airports; airports that by now dilapidated and falling apart, however with small investments and repairs can become useful centers for our fledgeling Air Force. "
AFR_Our_own_Air_Force:0 "Beginnings of an Air Force"
AFR_Our_own_Air_Force_desc:0 "While hardly an air force by European standards, we have carved a small yet proud air force out from the scraps and leftovers of old regimes. Our airmen will patrol our skies against airborne threats, decimating any who dare oppose us from above. While our planes may be rusty, and while their engines squeak and squeal every time they take off, a continual effort into maintenance and acquisition of new aircraft will keep our force functional. "

AFR_Using_old_Vessels:0 "Using Old Vessels"
AFR_Using_old_Vessels_desc:0 "The majority of former Mittelafrika fleet stayed loyal to Admiral Heydrich, leaving the states borne out of the collapse with little in the way of naval assets. By scavenging abandoned crafts floating aimlessly off our coasts, we shall begin laying the groundwork for a brand new naval force capable of defending our coasts with ease. "
AFR_Convert_Fishing_Boats:0 "Convert Fishing Boats"
AFR_Convert_Fishing_Boats_desc:0 "While we have little in the way of actual vessels, one thing we have an abundance of is fishing vessels; small ships with operate off our coasts in hopes of catching fish. We will use spare funds to buy these ships off of our fishermen, and adapt them to serve as naval vessels. While having a navy comprised mainly of old fishing boats with 4 inch guns bolted to their bows is far from ideal, it is the best we can do considering our circumstances. "
AFR_Sell_Ship_Registrations:0 "Seize Foreign Ships"
AFR_Sell_Ship_Registrations_desc:0 "One way to increase our supply of ships is a very simple process: a process called stealing other people’s vessels. Any ships that dare venture into our coastlines without proper tribute will be seized by our coast guard and retrofitted for our naval forces. This may not be an ideal way of expanding our navy, it is the easiest way we can think of considering our limited resources; even if it comes at the cost of ships avoiding our waters. "
AFR_Harass_Enemy_Ships:0 "Harassing the Enemy"
AFR_Harass_Enemy_Ships_desc:0 "While we can do little to seriously oppose a superior naval force, we can hope to harass them, making every second of naval warfare difficult for them. By using tactics such as suicide craft and hijacking, we shall inconvenience the enemy navies, enough to get them to hopefully leave us alone."
