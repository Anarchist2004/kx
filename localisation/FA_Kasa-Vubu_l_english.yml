POLITICS_ROSEN_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_MASSU_DESC:0 "The young officer-turned-mercenary Jacques Massu has lived a violent career in his young life. Born in 1908 in France before the fall of the Empire, Massu was just a child when Paris fell and the Commune rose, and witnessed the fall of an empire with his very own eyes as brother fought brother in the Fall of France before finally escaping to Algiers with his family. Burning with a patriotic zeal common for men in the nationalist exile regime in Algiers, Massu fell into a military life as soon as he came of age, and spent much of his early military career crushing Tuaregs and other tribes of the Sahara for the Petain regime. Growing disillusioned with his government’s ‘righteous destiny’ to reclaim the Metropole, Massu and a retinue of his closest comrades and followers fled from French Chad into Sub-Saharan Africa, finding themselves in the Vrijstaat and finding quick positions within the Force Publique as foreign hires. As Massu and his men continued their work under the FP, they increasingly began to fall further into ‘corrupt’ practices, such as taking bribes or looting tribal settlements, quickly picking up a taste for the mercenary lifestyle. After their commanding officers in the Force Publique had gotten wind of the nature of their new habits, Massu and his men were once again forced to flee. However, this time they would not flee to another colony or regime, but to the Jungle itself, seeking to carve out their own mercenary state free from the prying eyes and nagging rules of other regimes."

KSV_mercs_not_governors_desc:0 "Though the varied men of our ranks hold all manner of unique talents and skills, a knack for true statecraft is not one of them. In truth, we have next to no idea how to truly govern a populace or run a state, for we have about as many administrators and bureaucrats currently within our ranks as we do women or dead men. We must remedy this shortcoming at once, lest we too fall into collapse and chaos."

outerheaven.1.t:0 "Creating the Mercenary Committee"
outerheaven.1.d:0 "Jacques Massu leads the brave mercenaries of the West Congo in rebellion against the tyrannical Pierre Ryckmans as the Congo, and Mittelafrika as a whole, dissolve into a maelstrom of disorder and lawlessness. Under his guidance, we have revolted against the oppressive regime in the capital, seeking to bring true freedom to these dark jungles. However, many in our ranks seek to incorporate all of the various mercenary companies scattered across the Congo, uniting under one banner to fight for our right to wage war and live as we see fit. Leading this opposition is none other than famous explorer and soldier-for-hire Gustaf Hallstrom. The grizzled veteran serves as a unifying figure amongst the disparate mercenary groups, and many in our inner-circle feel that his inclusion would spell the end of our administration’s rule as we fall subservient to Hallstrom’s rule. How shall we go forward?"
outerheaven.1.a:0 "Massu will Rule Alone, forget Hallstrom"
outerheaven.1.b:0 "Allow Hallstrom in"

outerheaven.2.t:0 "Hallstrom's Coup"
outerheaven.2.d:0 "With the various clans and outfits of mercenaries supporting him, Gustaf Hallstrom has secured control over the hordes of hired guns that were currently revolting from Pierre Ryckmans’ regime. Under the stalwart soldier’s skill and guidance, we shall march from Coquilhatville and descend into the greater Congo, spreading our influence as we hack our enemies down at every turn. We will carve out our own independent state free from the lording fools in Dar-Es-Salaam and Leopoldville. As we march towards our uncertain destiny, the lessons of von Hallstrom echo in the minds of each of our soldiers. “A strong man doesn’t need to see the future...he makes his own.”"
outerheaven.2.a:0 "This is our only home. Our heaven and our hell. This is Outer Heaven."

outerheaven.3.t:0 "Of Mercs and Men
outerheaven.3.d:0 "Hired armies, soldiers of fortune, and other forms of mercenaries have been used in Africa for centuries, but the Vrijstaat has turned the practice into a practical arm of the state. Before the fall of Mittelafrika, mercs would be frequently used to supplement the Force Publique, with each payment upon services rendered adding to their strength and hunger for more war and profit. \n\nThe Mercenaries de Congo Ouest are the largest coalition of these mercenary groups in Africa, and possibly the world - a misfit band of thugs, soldiers, adventurers, poachers, thieves, hunters, sailors, pilots, and so many more banded together under one common identity and profession. With the collapse of the German colonial empire in Africa, this band of thieves has seized on the chance to declare their own sovereign mercenary state, and now they must fight for their lives to earn their right to independence. \n\nThe love of thrills and the unknown are what has driven them all to join up together as one, united band of mercenaries, for even mercs know that there is always strength and opportunity in numbers. However, our brotherhood is not as united and jovial as it may seem, and even now the various internal factions vye power and influence as [KSV.getleader] tries to lead us through these hellish times. Now, with our backs to the wall and all of the Congo against us, we must fight tooth and nail to carve out our own sector of the world here in the Dark Heart of Africa."

KSV_battle_for_the_heart_of_the_congo_desc:0 "In screaming defiance of the old order, we Mercenaries de Congo Ouest raged against the dying regime that once controlled the Vrijstaat. After reveling in the glorious cacophony of war, we have emerged triumphant, clutching both victory and the Congo in our palms as we stand atop a mountain of corpses and ash. Now, it is up to our fractorious and schismatic band of brothers to settle our differences once and for all in order to finally declare a new master of this dark heart of Africa."
KSV_set_up_the_commitee:0 "Set up the Mercenary Committee"
KSV_set_up_the_commitee_desc:0 "The men of our merry band are at eachothers’ throats, and if this inner-conflict continues, we shall lose control over this prize and descend into chaos and war once more - an obstacle our fledgling state does not need to reach. In order to abate this crisis, a new joint committee must be created, drawing from each of the major groups, cliques, and factions within our brotherhood. By pooling together and working to an agreeable compromise is the only way this mercenary horde shall be able to cooperate long enough to be able to establish the foundations of our new regime without spilling more precious blood."
KSV_pay_the_troops:0 "Pay the Men"
KSV_pay_the_troops_desc:0 "The time for diplomacy ended when the fires of our rebellion were first ignited, and now the only talking shall be done at the end of a barrel. Using the newfound plunder and loot earned in our conquest of the Congo, we shall pay the men and prepare them for the glories of war once more. One final rapturous battle awaits our brotherhood until we reach our new destiny, and the road to it shall be paved with skulls and blood as we march against our foes into our promised dawn. The only loyal mercenary is a paid one."
KSV_three_men_enter:0 "Three Men Enter..."
KSV_three_men_enter_desc:0 "Though our brotherhood is filled with competing cliques and figures vying for power and influence, there are but three men who hold any real shot at controlling this unruly band of miscreants. These titans and potential Bosses of the Mercenaries de Congo Ouest , namely the famed Swedish aviator-turned-mercenary and humanitarian Carl Gustaf von Rosen, the ex-Entente general Jacques Massau, and the famed archeologist and adventure himself Gustaf Axel Hallström, now stand as the last hopes and potential destinies for our newly independent mercenary state. Now, with our new homeland’s destiny hanging in the balance, these three men play their games of deception and intrigue in their own attempts to seize power once and for all, but only one shall emerge as the one true Boss."

KSV_war_has_changed:0 "War has Changed"
KSV_war_has_changed_desc:0 "War has changed. \nIt's no longer about nations, ideologies, or ethnicity. It's an endless series of proxy battles, fought by mercenaries and machines. War, and it's consumption of life, has become a well-oiled machine. \nWar has changed. \nModern soldiers carry modern weapons, use modern gear. Pharmaceuticals inside their bodies enhance and regulate their abilities. Genetic control, information control, emotion control, battlefield control...everything is monitored and kept under control. \nWar...has changed. \nThe age of ingenuity has become the age of control, all in the name of averting catastrophe from weapons of mass destruction, and he who controls the battlefield, controls history. When the battlefield is under total control, war becomes routine. \nWar...has changed."

KSV_unite_the_mercs_desc:0 "Under a baptism of lead and napalm our brotherhood has been forged into a cohesive, though distinct, group of expert soldiers, adventurers, and conquerors. The bonds created during the chaos of the Congo Crisis and our subsequent power struggle have been steeled and reinforced in the fires of shared adversity and pursuit of our likeminded ambitions. Under the courageous leadership of Gustaf Axel Hallström and his two brothers, we have walked through Hell itself and survived to tell the tale, and our union is stronger for it!"
KSV_no_angels_in_heaven:0 "No Angels in Heaven"
KSV_no_angels_in_heaven_desc:0 "There is no room for angels in our heaven. War, hardship, adventure, and more have cleansed the weak and frail from our new paradise here at the dark heart of this world. Those with clean, unbloodied hands who have never experienced the exhilarating decadence that is total war and the comradery that comes with it shall be expelled from our brotherhood and cast out into the predator-filled thickets that fill this great Eden we now call our new Outer Heaven."
KSV_mother_base:0 "Mother Base"
KSV_mother_base_desc:0 "Our newly forged regime shall need a new center of control, for no single settlement within our state is loyal nor secure enough to establish our new headquarters in. Off the coast of Leopoldville, nestled high over the rippling waves of the mighty Congo river atop a great steel superstructure, we shall construct a new fortress from which to rule over this new paradise we have conquered. This new Mother Base shall serve as the nervecenter of our entire operation as we seek to solidify our hold over these lands whilst tricking the world that the old order of the Vrijstaat never faltered."
KSV_more_contacts:0 "Codec Contacts"
KSV_more_contacts_desc:0 "Through our intense organization and consolidation efforts, we have begun work on establishing a new international contact system for all mercenaries with links to our regime. With this umbrella network, we shall be able to reach out to any possible associate quickly and secretly without the rest of the world learning of our intentions through the use of both old and new technologies. Everything at our disposal from the newest radio technologies to simple telegrams and messenger pigeons shall link together our cadre, allowing us to grow our influence and further spread our strengthening facade. The world must never learn that we are truly in control of the Congo, and with a wider network of contacts at our disposal, keeping the truth buried in this primordial jungle shall be much easier."
KSV_the_man_who_sold_the_world:0 "The Man Who Sold The World"
KSV_the_man_who_sold_the_world_desc:0 "We laughed and shook hands as our deals were crafted in backroom deals, and made our way back home to our newfound bounties and riches. We searched for ore and land, for years and years we surveyed, as we gazed a gazeless stare at the natural bounties of this paradise - the Congo. We’ve dug a million mines, and our foes must have died alone, a long, long time ago. Who knows? Not us, we never lost control in pursuit of profit and new adventure, and now you’re face to face with the men who shall sell the world."
KSV_hallstroms_science:0 "New Science"
KSV_hallstroms_science_desc:0 "Our new regime requires new science to accurately describe why and how our unruly band of scoundrels has been able to topple both the old colonial order and the hopes of African self-rule. Drawing from his own views on biologic-racial theory and from the writings of the likes of Charles Darwin, Arthur de Gobineau, and Lothrop Stoddard, Boss Hallström seeks to usher in a new era of scientific thought to our new state. Through the application of modern, scientific ideas about race, ethnicity, and nationality and their ties to intelligence, obedience, and other traits, we shall devise better methods of keeping control over this unruly jungle."
KSV_already_a_demon:0 "Already a Demon"
KSV_already_a_demon_desc:0 "The men of our brotherhood lost their innocence ages ago, long being cast down from the Heavens to this hellish land of violence and savagery. We must embrace this ideal and fully revel in the glorious chaos that is bloodshed and war, for that is what we excel at above all others. No bidder shall be turned away and no client denied, for as long as they are willing to pay, our men shall be willing to do anything. The era of ideology, nationality, and ethics are over, for profit and the pursuit of the rush of war shall be our only creed."
KSV_good_soldiers_follow_orders:0 "Good Soldiers Follow Orders"
KSV_good_soldiers_follow_orders_desc:0 "Good soldiers follow orders. The men of our brotherhood must be taught this simple law until it becomes their personal creed, their own mantra or dogma oft-repeated and ever drilled into their thick skulls. Good soldiers follow orders. The state and our regime must be the single most important thing in the heart of all our battlebrothers, and loyalty to this state must be paramount. Orders from a higher officer might as well be orders from God himself, for no other decrees matter here. Good soldiers follow orders..."

KSV_to_the_highest_bidder_desc:0 "The only loyal merc is a paid merc - this central rule to our philosophy shall become official state policy. No task shall be too treacherous and no job too dangerous, as long as the pay is good enough. Our brotherhood holds some of the best military men on this planet, and as such we know what we and our talents are worth. Only to the highest bidder shall our services be awarded too, and with their fine rewards, we shall live like kings here in the darkest heart of this Dark Continent."
KSV_fight_for_what_we_belive_in:0 "Fight for What We Believe In"
KSV_fight_for_what_we_belive_in_desc:0 "Though we are brigands and soldiers, mercenaries and hired murderers, that does not mean we do not have principles. War may be a chaotic cacophony that fosters death and horrific, immoral acts, but it is also a beautiful artscape that we have mastered through raw skill and practice, infusing our own ideas and notions on subjective morality to make this most holy of acts truly righteous. We charge forth into the maelstrom that swirls around our destiny, clutching tight to our honor and our ideals as we endeavor to never lose sight of ourselves and our principles as we rage against the civilized world as the new masters of conflict."
KSV_no_masters:0 "No Masters..."
KSV_no_masters_desc:0 "Our band of brothers has never been beholden to foreign forces and outsiders, for breaking free from these national chains was the original intent of our very revolt. We have no gods, no masters, and no lords to rule over us. The pursuit of profit shall be our creed, the blood-rain of warfare shall be our baptism, and war itself shall be our god. We have earned our freedom and our sovereignty by marching through hell itself, and we shall not throw it away so quickly."
KSV_best_of_the_best:0 "The Best of the Best of the Best"
KSV_best_of_the_best_desc:0 "Our mercenaries are the greatest soldiers in the world; their talents and skills honed in the raging inferno of total war. From across the globe our men hail from, and with them they have brought their unique aptitudes and have helped integrate them into our wider doctrine. Between our battlebrothers stands multiple millennia of combined combat experience, evolving these once mere veterans into the best of the best of the best that the world can offer."
KSV_war_and_adventure:0 "Only War and Adventure!"
KSV_war_and_adventure_desc:0 "This paradise has been molded by our brotherhood to meet the needs and desires of our men without revealing our true nature to the wider world. As the rest of the world looks on seeing the ‘true’ Vrijstaat continuing its mandate, they are blinded by our facade, hiding our true intentions and goals. This secrecy has given us the freedom to pursue life as we see fit as the proven masters of both the Congo and conflict itself, and with this gift we have created the perfect society. Greed, hollow faith, and self-serving political ambition have all been purged or otherwise cast aside, shedding the weaknesses that plague lesser men. Only war, only adventure truly matters!"
