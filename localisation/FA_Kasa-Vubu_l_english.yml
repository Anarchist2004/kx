POLITICS_MASSU_DESC:0 "The young officer-turned-mercenary Jacques Massu has lived a violent career in his young life. Born in 1908 in France before the fall of the Empire, Massu was just a child when Paris fell and the Commune rose, and witnessed the fall of an empire with his very own eyes as brother fought brother in the Fall of France before finally escaping to Algiers with his family. Burning with a patriotic zeal common for men in the nationalist exile regime in Algiers, Massu fell into a military life as soon as he came of age, and spent much of his early military career crushing Tuaregs and other tribes of the Sahara for the Petain regime. Growing disillusioned with his government’s ‘righteous destiny’ to reclaim the Metropole, Massu and a retinue of his closest comrades and followers fled from French Chad into Sub-Saharan Africa, finding themselves in the Vrijstaat and finding quick positions within the Force Publique as foreign hires. As Massu and his men continued their work under the FP, they increasingly began to fall further into ‘corrupt’ practices, such as taking bribes or looting tribal settlements, quickly picking up a taste for the mercenary lifestyle. After their commanding officers in the Force Publique had gotten wind of the nature of their new habits, Massu and his men were once again forced to flee. However, this time they would not flee to another colony or regime, but to the Jungle itself, seeking to carve out their own mercenary state free from the prying eyes and nagging rules of other regimes."

outerheaven.1.t:0 "Creating the Mercenary Committee"
outerheaven.1.d:0 "Jacques Massu leads the brave mercenaries of the West Congo in rebellion against the tyrannical Pierre Ryckmans as the Congo, and Mittelafrika as a whole, dissolve into a maelstrom of disorder and lawlessness. Under his guidance, we have revolted against the oppressive regime in the capital, seeking to bring true freedom to these dark jungles. However, many in our ranks seek to incorporate all of the various mercenary companies scattered across the Congo, uniting under one banner to fight for our right to wage war and live as we see fit. Leading this opposition is none other than famous explorer and soldier-for-hire Gustaf Hallstrom. The grizzled veteran serves as a unifying figure amongst the disparate mercenary groups, and many in our inner-circle feel that his inclusion would spell the end of our administration’s rule as we fall subservient to Hallstrom’s rule. How shall we go forward?"

outerheaven.2.t:0 "Hallstrom's Coup"
outerheaven.2.d:0 "With the various clans and outfits of mercenaries supporting him, Gustaf Hallstrom has secured control over the hordes of hired guns that were currently revolting from Pierre Ryckmans’ regime. Under the stalwart soldier’s skill and guidance, we shall march from Coquilhatville and descend into the greater Congo, spreading our influence as we hack our enemies down at every turn. We will carve out our own independent state free from the lording fools in Dar-Es-Salaam and Leopoldville. As we march towards our uncertain destiny, the lessons of von Hallstrom echo in the minds of each of our soldiers. “A strong man doesn’t need to see the future...he makes his own.”"
outerheaven.2.a:0 "This is our only home. Our heaven and our hell. This is Outer Heaven."

outerheaven.3.t:0 "Of Mercs and Men"
outerheaven.3.d:0 "Hired armies, soldiers of fortune, and other forms of mercenaries have been used in Africa for centuries, but the Vrijstaat has turned the practice into a practical arm of the state. Before the fall of Mittelafrika, mercs would be frequently used to supplement the Force Publique, with each payment upon services rendered adding to their strength and hunger for more war and profit. \n\nThe Mercenaries de Congo Ouest are the largest coalition of these mercenary groups in Africa, and possibly the world - a misfit band of thugs, soldiers, adventurers, poachers, thieves, hunters, sailors, pilots, and so many more banded together under one common identity and profession. With the collapse of the German colonial empire in Africa, this band of thieves has seized on the chance to declare their own sovereign mercenary state, and now they must fight for their lives to earn their right to independence. \n\nThe love of thrills and the unknown are what has driven them all to join up together as one, united band of mercenaries, for even mercs know that there is always strength and opportunity in numbers. However, our brotherhood is not as united and jovial as it may seem, and even now the various internal factions vye power and influence as [KSV.getleader] tries to lead us through these hellish times. Now, with our backs to the wall and all of the Congo against us, we must fight tooth and nail to carve out our own sector of the world here in the Dark Heart of Africa."

KSV_battle_for_the_heart_of_the_congo_desc:0 "In screaming defiance of the old order, we Mercenaries de Congo Ouest raged against the dying regime that once controlled the Vrijstaat. After reveling in the glorious cacophony of war, we have emerged triumphant, clutching both victory and the Congo in our palms as we stand atop a mountain of corpses and ash. Now, it is up to our fractorious and schismatic band of brothers to settle our differences once and for all in order to finally declare a new master of this dark heart of Africa."
KSV_set_up_the_commitee:0 "Set up the Mercenary Committee"
KSV_set_up_the_commitee_desc:0 "The men of our merry band are at eachothers’ throats, and if this inner-conflict continues, we shall lose control over this prize and descend into chaos and war once more - an obstacle our fledgling state does not need to reach. In order to abate this crisis, a new joint committee must be created, drawing from each of the major groups, cliques, and factions within our brotherhood. By pooling together and working to an agreeable compromise is the only way this mercenary horde shall be able to cooperate long enough to be able to establish the foundations of our new regime without spilling more precious blood."

Using the newfound plunder and loot earned in our conquest of the Congo, we shall pay the men and prepare them for the glories of war once more. One final rapturous battle awaits our brotherhood until we reach our new destiny, and the road to it shall be paved with skulls and blood as we march against our foes into our promised dawn. The only loyal mercenary is a paid one."

KSV_three_men_enter_desc:0 "Though our brotherhood is filled with competing cliques and figures vying for power and influence, there are but three men who hold any real shot at controlling this unruly band of miscreants. These titans and potential Bosses of the Mercenaries de Congo Ouest , namely the famed Swedish aviator-turned-mercenary and humanitarian Carl Gustav von Rosen, the ex-Entente general Jacques Massau, and the famed archeologist and adventure himself Gustaf Axel Hallström, now stand as the last hopes and potential destinies for our newly independent mercenary state. Now, with our new homeland’s destiny hanging in the balance, these three men play their games of deception and intrigue in their own attempts to seize power once and for all, but only one shall emerge as the one true Boss."

War, and it's consumption of life, has become a well-oiled machine. \nWar has changed. \nModern soldiers carry modern weapons, use modern gear. Pharmaceuticals inside their bodies enhance and regulate their abilities. Genetic control, information control, emotion control, battlefield control...everything is monitored and kept under control. \nWar...has changed. \nThe age of ingenuity has become the age of control, all in the name of averting catastrophe from weapons of mass destruction, and he who controls the battlefield, controls history.

KSV_mother_base_desc:0 "Our newly forged regime shall need a new center of control, for no single settlement within our state is loyal nor secure enough to establish our new headquarters in. Off the coast of Leopoldville, nestled high over the rippling waves of the mighty Congo river atop a great steel superstructure, we shall construct a new fortress from which to rule over this new paradise we have conquered.

With this umbrella network, we shall be able to reach out to any possible associate quickly and secretly without the rest of the world learning of our intentions through the use of both old and new technologies. Everything at our disposal from the newest radio technologies to simple telegrams and messenger pigeons shall link together our cadre, allowing us to grow our influence and further spread our strengthening facade. The world must never learn that we are truly in control of the Congo, and with a wider network of contacts at our disposal, keeping the truth buried in this primordial jungle shall be much easier."

KSV_the_man_who_sold_the_world_desc:0 "We laughed and shook hands as our deals were crafted in backroom deals, and made our way back home to our newfound bounties and riches. We searched for ore and land, for years and years we surveyed, as we gazed a gazeless stare at the natural bounties of this paradise - the Congo. We’ve dug a million mines, and our foes must have died alone, a long, long time ago. Who knows? Not us, we never lost control in pursuit of profit and new adventure, and now you’re face to face with the men who shall sell the world."

KSV_hallstroms_science_desc:0 "Our new regime requires new science to accurately describe why and how our unruly band of scoundrels has been able to topple both the old colonial order and the hopes of African self-rule. Drawing from his own views on biologic-racial theory and from the writings of the likes of Charles Darwin, Arthur de Gobineau, and Lothrop Stoddard, Boss Hallström seeks to usher in a new era of scientific thought to our new state. Through the application of modern, scientific ideas about race, ethnicity, and nationality and their ties to intelligence, obedience, and other traits, we shall devise better methods of keeping control over this unruly jungle."

This secrecy has given us the freedom to pursue life as we see fit as the proven masters of both the Congo and conflict itself, and with this gift we have created the perfect society.

Under his rule, the Congo shall be transformed into Massu’s own personal feudalist fiefdom, based around a mercenary-noble class that serves as the landowners, with other allied native chiefs and colonial remnants serving as subordinate ‘lords.’ Under this system, the Congo shall fuse modernity with tradition, forming a new knightly state here in the dark heart of Africa."

Their various chiefs, presidents, tribal lords, and other leaders shall serve as nominal lords under Dauphin Massu, each free to govern their own people as they see fit without meddling or interference from our regime.

KSV_for_the_solider_desc:0 "The Congo, though knighty and chivalric, is still a state run by an army of mercenaries and hired guns. Now sworn by oath and blood to their chapters within our brotherhood, they are beholden to a set of ideals based on the old chivalric codes of France and serve as the backbone of authority and hierarchy within our new Congo - a true army with a state, with the famed general and liege Massu atop it all. Everything in our nation that does not go to continuing our regular functions and development must be poured into the army, for without it, we are nothing."

KSV_let_us_take_flight:0 "Let Us Take Flight"
KSV_let_us_take_flight_desc:0 "The famed aviator turned soldier of fortune Carl Gustav von Rosen has come out on top after the power struggle within the ranks of the Mercenaries de Congo Ouest. This famed stunt pilot and philanthropist has fled his native Sweden and seeks to create a true adventurer’s paradise here in the Congo. Drawing from his love for humanitarian efforts, his admiration for aviation, and from the egalitarian yet harsh ideas of the original Roman Republic, Rosen hopes to create a new, one-of-a-kind state here in this dark heart of Africa, and nothing shall get in his way of uplifting and protecting both his battlebrothers and his new countrymen."
KSV_humanitarian_aid:0 "Humanitarian Aid"
KSV_humanitarian_aid_desc:0 "Our fearless leader General von Rosen has long held sympathies for the downtrodden and the oppressed, even starting his flying career by piloting relief missions to war torn regions across Africa and the Middle East. This spirit of aiding those in need has begun to rub off on many of those within this Swede’s clique, and many have moved to emulate his graciousness. Our mercenaries shall be trained and encouraged to not only hone their skills of war, but to also hone their ability to help others, for we may revel in the beauty that is war, but regular civilians do not. Using our mastery of the skies and our knowledge of this harsh terrain, we shall spread across Congo and lighten the burdens of life ever so slightly if we can."
KSV_make_amends:0 "Make Amends"
KSV_make_amends_desc:0 "The Congo Crisis brought out the worst in humanity, showcasing just how savage and uncaring we truly can be. We must make amends with the disparate groups of the Congo, from the shattered and dispersed colonials to the angry and displeased natives, so that the Congo can truly heal as one, for we are stuck with each other whether we like it or not."
KSV_the_congolese_soldiers_republic:0 "A Congolese Soldiers Republic"
KSV_the_congolese_soldiers_republic_desc:0 "Drawing from the ideals of the Roman Republic and their mighty, honorable Senate, Carl Gustav von Rosen has ascended to the role of Consul of the Congo, and has moved to create a new mercenary-led Congolese martial republic based on the ideals of the old Roman regime. A new Senātus Populusque Congensis shall serve as the main governing body of our new Congolese Soldiers Republic, giving all those a voice who have rightfully earned it, and Consul von Rosen shall be the herald of our new, brighter destiny."
KSV_service_guarentees_citizens:0 "Service Guarantees Citizenship"
KSV_service_guarentees_citizens_desc:0 "Service guarantees citizenship! Do you want to learn more? There is but one way to earn full citizenship in our new republic, and that is through the hardships and honor of military service. All in the Congo must be made to do their part in the coming struggles for survival, and the resources and full benefits of our mighty republic must only be granted to those who truly have earned it! A citizen of the Congo must have the courage to make the safety of our people their personal responsibility, and if they hold true to this ideal, only then shall they be fully welcomed into our society and be given a voice. "
KSV_not_on_race_but_on_skill:0 "We See No Colour, Only Skill"
KSV_not_on_race_but_on_skill_desc:0 "The Congo is a varied place, full of many people from many backgrounds and cultures. We care not for the meaningless divisions, for our state only prizes one thing - skill. If proven useful enough, talented enough, or skilled enough in criteria or applications needed by the state, then military service and eventual citizenship shall be fully open to you. We see no colour in the Congo but the red of a hero’s blood and the blue of our mighty river that serves as the lifeline of our nation. All can be members of our society, they just need to prove themselves first."
KSV_play_our_part:0 "Playing Our Part"
KSV_play_our_part_desc:0 "The Congo must be made into a modern state to support our growing republic if we are to continue our mandate and our prosperity. We shall embark on a series of civilizing, industrializing, and other nation-building projects to uplift the Congo into the modern age. New schools, roads, health clinics, railroads, naval infrastructure, housing blocks, electrical and sewer grids, and so much more shall be constructed not only in the cities, but across the rural expanses of the Congo as well. If we are to rule these lands and be the new masters of the Congo, then it is up to us to be the ones to carry these primordial wildlands into the future."
KSV_mercanary_democracy:0 "A Mercenary Democracy"
KSV_mercanary_democracy_desc:0 "We have built a true mercenary-led democracy here in the Congo, with Consul von Rosen at its head. All may be graced by the light of our republic if they just volunteer for military service first. This egalitarian, martial, and meritocratic republic now stands as the best hope for a stable Congo, with Consul von Rosen dedicated to bringing pure prosperity and peace to these lands - a true era of Pax Congensis."
KSV_a_society_of_equals:0 "A Society of Equals"
KSV_a_society_of_equals_desc:0 "Our republic has been forged on the ideals of egalitarianism and true equality, if one proves their worth that is. No matter where you were born or what station you lived in, it all matters not when you enter our borders. Only service and skill matters here, not the color of your skin or the gender of your birth, for as long as you can fire a rifle accurately and survive in this deadly jungle, you are fit enough to join our martial society. All are equal in the face of war and chaos, as long as they are willing to fight."

KSV_a_roman_congo_desc:0 "Consul von Rosen has created a truly magnificent leading body to rule over the Congo - the Senātus Populusque Congensis - to administer this great primordial expanse. Within this body, the loyal generals and high officers of our brotherhood serve as praetors and quaestors with our lower NCOs and the rank and file, as well as our loyal chiefs and colonialists, serve as aediles, tribunes, or lower governors; each dedicated to our growing republic, and each serving their Consul and the Congo above any self-absorbed pursuit."
KSV_rule_of_fortune_and_adventure:0 "Rule of Fortune and Adventure"
KSV_rule_of_fortune_and_adventure_desc:0 "The most paramount ideal of our brotherhood is still the intoxicating pursuit of war and adventure - the cacophony and maelstrom of chaos that accompanies these pursuits serving as the opiate of our masses. We must pursue the unknown and the unconquered unlike any other, and tame the hinterlands of this ancient paradise to our own whims. The Congo shall be made ours, and so shall the hidden riches of the world, for we are the greatest adventurers and soldiers to ever live!"
KSV_sow_instability:0 "Sow Discord Amongst Our Enemies"
KSV_sow_instability_desc:0 "We must sow chaos and discord within the ranks of our varied foes, for we are alone here in this dark heart of Africa, and our enemies stand numerous and unyielding. Only through subterfuge and deception, and by turning our enemies against one another, can we hope to weaken their forces enough so that our glorious soldiers may strike them down, for we may be the greatest warriors alive, but we are few in number and fewer in supplies."
KSV_outplay_the_big_dogs:0 "Outplay the Big Dogs"
KSV_outplay_the_big_dogs_desc:0 "The Entente and the Third Internationale stand as the most direct threat to our rule, for the Germans seem none-too-concerned by our mandate so long as they still receive their promised profits from the UMHK. With this in mind, we must play these other two world-class alliances off eachother like fools to both weaken their own positions and to improve our own. We shall worm our way into their systems and their networks, siphoning their information and their strength as we play them off each other and make them out to be fools for our own profit and amusement."

KSV_rule_from_the_sky_desc:0 "The skies are the limit, and luckily none fly farther and faster than the men of Consul von Rosen’s flying brigades. Under the steely-eyed watch of these warhawks and their ground liaisons within our mercenary brotherhood, the expanse of the Congo and its surrounding lands throughout Central Africa are surveyed day and night, patrolled for possible conflicts and adventures ripe for our men to join in on. From the skies, we shall rule over this paradise as its new masters as we command the skies, the jungles, and the Congo itself to our whims."
