### Leader Desc ###
POLITICS_GRIGORY_ZINOVIEV_DESC:0 "Born in a wealthy family in Yelisavetgrad, Ukraine, Zinoviev, however, became a member of RSDRP and a revolutionary in 1901. Because of his actions, he had to flee to Europe where he got acquinted with Lenin and quickly arose to become one of his closest allies along with Lev Kamenev. Before the October Revolution, he criticized Lenin's idea of armed revolt and advocated for a homogeneous socialist government though. Despite critisim, he supported Lenin in many cases and he was chosen the leader of the Bolsheviks after Lenin's death. Zinoviev was one of the main organisers of the Red Terror and repressions against non-socialist opposition. In 1920, a few months before the end of the Civil War, the party has split into two. While RKP was mostly in immigration and underground, the opposition in RKP, Bukharin, Shlaypnikov and Rykov established their own party and Kerensky even legalized their party, however banning them from elections. On the other hand, Kamenev, Zinoviev and Preobrazhensky became known as the Old Guard and left for France, however still supporting underground activities in Russia. In 1936 RKP are still banned in Russia and even their former allies in NSP are unlikely to lift a ban, however, if the situation in Russia will be too destabilized, they can hope for restoring Bolshevism in Russia again."
POLITICS_LEV_KAMENEV_DESC:0 "Lev Rosenfeld was born to a family that was involved in revolutionary politics. Lev was an early member of the Bolshevik Party, which he joined as early as 1901. He took part in the first Russian Revolution in 1905, then lived abroad, where he became a close supporter of Lenin, but was arrested on arrival in Russia in 1914. Released from prison in the early days of the February Revolution, Lev Kamenev led the Bolshevik resistance along with Vladimir Lenin and Grigory Zinoviev.\n\nKamenev, like Zinoviev, voted against the armed insurrection of the Bolsheviks, and then they were against the decision of Lenin and Trotsky to create a one-party dictatorship of the proletariat. Recently appointed to the post of head of the VTSIK, Kamenev resigned soon after. The turning point was the assassination of Lenin in 1918. Kamenev supported Zinoviev as the new leader of the Bolshevik party and, as a result of the defeat of the Reds in the civil War, was forced to leave Russia for the French Commune.\n\nAbroad, Kamenev continued to work in the Bolshevik Party, but still tended to create a homogeneous socialist government when returning to Russia. Zinoviev, on the other hand, assumed that if the Bolsheviks returned, if they were not arrested, the other parties would clearly not be happy with them, and therefore advocated a one-party dictatorship, as Lenin had bequeathed.\n\nNow Kamenev is at the head of the party, and despite the internal party opposition, he will strive to adapt the Bolshevik program to the new Russian realities and create a homogeneous socialist government with other parties."
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_MAYAKOVSKY_DESC:0 "Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky was born to an impoverished noble family in Georgia. In 1907 he became an activist in underground Social Democrats' circle and later joined the RSDRP the same year. As a Bolshevik activist he was finally imprisoned for almost a year. He left the party soon after his release, but remained an ardent socialist and became involved in the socialist art instead. He attended the Moscow Art School and became one of the pioneers of Futurist literature in Russia.\n\nMayakovsky embraced the Bolshevik Russian Revolution wholeheartedly and became a fiery propagandist of Bolshevism. A vigorous spokesman for the Communist Party, Mayakovsky contibuted much in a popular image of the Bolsheviks. In 1919 he tried to established Komfut - a Futurist organisation affiliated to the Bolshevik party, but it was swiftly dissolved following the intervention of Anatoly Lunacharsky.\n\nAfter the Civil War Mayakovsky left for Georgia, where he served his role as a Bolshevist propagandist. He occasionally went on journeys to syndicalist Europe, where he promoted Futurism and Proletkult of Lunacharsky. On the basis of his experience, he developed a new ideology of Social-Futurism: what can be called his own desire to create a society of educated and talented people."
POLITICS_ANATOLY_LUNACHARSKY_DESC:0 "Anatoly Lunacharsky is a truly dedicated Marxist with a huge revolutionary experience. A member of the RSDRP since 1895, he had great influence as one of the leaders of the Bolsheviks, along with Alexander Bogdanov and Vladimir Lenin. Lunacharsky became known all over the world after his successful project of Proletarian Culture. Anatoly believed that the workers should belong to the only and exclusive culture of the proletariat, which included more radical aspects, such as the construction of a new religion and god-building - the cult of Reason.\n\nShortly after the October Revolution, Lunacharsky became a People's Commissar and began his ambitious project of Proletkult - firstly a federation of local cultural societies and avant-garde artists. Proletkult aspired to radically modify existing artistic forms by creating a new, revolutionary working-class aesthetic, which drew its inspiration from the construction of modern industrial society in backward, agrarian Russia.\n\nAfter the Civil War the Proletkult was reestablished abroad, where it became not only an international organisation, but also a political program of the French Communards. Lunacharsky led a successful cultural revolution in France, where the ideas of proletarian culture, despite their blatant syndicalist overtones, had a wide impact on the people. His success won him widest possible acceptance.\n\nWith his return to Russia, Lunacharsky is eager to expand his Proletkult project, changing the Russian Society rapidly and radically. As a staunch internationalist, his ultimate dream is to create a unified utopian socialist state."
POLITICS_ALEKSEI_GASTEV_DESC:0 "Alexey Gastev - a member of the RSDRP since 1901, who took part in the 1905 Revolution. Working in Europe at the turn of the century, Gastev witnessed the application of assembly line production which was inspired by the Ford plant in the United States. At that time, he became familiar with French Syndicalism and adopted many of its views, seeing trade unions as a chief means of confronting capitalism by bringing concrete improvements into the lives of workers. By 1913, Gastev had joined the Circle of Proletarian Culture, established by Anatoly Lunacharsky.\n\nIn 1918 after the Revolution, Gastev won election as the Chairman of the Central Committee of the newly created All-Russian Union of Metal Workers. After the defeat of the Bolsheviks, Gastev had to flee for French Commune, where he continued his work not only as a proletarian, but also as a scientist. He developed the theory of Scientific Management of Labor and became widely known for greatly expanding Taylor's ideas and Ford's assumptions. As one of the ideologists of the Proletkult, Gastev's ideas had considerable success in France. Although Gastev is not a true follower of the ideas of Lenin and Zinoviev, his contribution to socialism cannot be denied. Once he is at the head of the country, who knows what great successes Russia will achieve."
POLITICS_GRIGORY_SOKOLNIKOV_DESC:0 "Grigory Sokolnikov is an outstanding revolutionary, who received a doctorate in economics from the Sorbonne, and has been a member of the RSDRP since 1905. Sokolnikov was closely acquainted with Bukharin - with him he organized the social-democratic organization of students in Moscow in 1906. Later, for his revolutionary activities, he was sent into exile, from which he managed to escape abroad. Abroad, he became an active member of the party, became close to Lenin, but opposed their divisive positions and advocated unity within the RSDLP.\n\nSokolnikov returned to Russia with Lenin in the "sealed wagon" and very quickly became one of the leaders of the Moscow Bolsheviks. During the Civil War, he led the nationalization of banks, and also became known as the man who signed the Brest-Litovsk Peace.\n\nSince 1918, he was on the fronts of the Civil War, was the commander of the 8th Army: Sokolnikov, who did not have a military education and experience of independent command, was appointed to this post to strengthen the confidence of the personnel in the supreme military leadership. He was a supporter of the creation of the Red Army on a regular basis with the use of military specialists and was against the policy of decossackization.\n\nAfter losing the civil war, Sokolnikov fled abroad, where he continued to work in the party. He supported Bukharin's idea of the NEP, but did not accept his creation of a new party and regarded it as a betrayal of the Bolsheviks and Lenin. Thus, Sokolnikov became a follower of the idea of 'slow, gradual and cautious implementation of socialism in practice' and strongly opposed Preobrazhensky's position on collectivization and forced industrialization. However, in the party environment, the idea of Preobrazhensky won.\n\nAfter the Bolsheviks took power in Russia, Sokolnikov began to demand a gradual transition to socialism and the introduction of Bukharin's economic policy. It is expected that he was branded as a 'Bukharinist', 'Menshevik' and 'revisionist'. However, with the assistance of other right-wing Bolsheviks, he managed to take a leading position in the Council of People's Commissars and become chairman of the government."
POLITICS_GEORGY_CHICHERIN_DESC:0 "'Chicherin is a great worker, conscientious, intelligent, knowledgeable. Such people should be appreciated. That his weakness is a lack of" command", it does not matter. You never know people with reverse weakness in the world!' - Lenin described Chicherin shortly before his death.\n\nIndeed, Chicherin does not have the necessary ability to manage people. But he is good at something else - diplomacy. He was one of the Bolsheviks who personally signed the Brest-Litovsk Peace, along with Sokolnikov. Soon he became the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, until the collapse of the Bolshevik government.\n\nIn exile in France, he became a representative of Soviet Russia and the RKP at the Third International, ideologically becoming close to the Jacobins.\n\nUpon his return to Russia, Chicherin was elected one of the members of the Central Committee of the RKP at the Congress of Soviets. However, due to his poor physical condition, it is unlikely that he can fully manage the country. Nevertheless, he supported Sokolnikov and said that an immediate transition to socialism in Russia would be a disaster.\n\nNow, once at the head of the country, it is unknown whether Chicherin will be able to be an effective manager. In any case, he relies on the help of supporters, among whom is Mikhail Kalinin."
POLITICS_VYACHESLAV_MOLOTOV_DESC:0 "Vyacheslav Molotov joined the RSDLP in 1906, where he soon joined the Leninist faction of the Bolsheviks. As a member of the Petrograd Revolutionary Military Committee, he was one of the planners of the 1917 revolution.\n\nAfter Lenin's death, Molotov became one of Grigory Zinoviev's closest associates, a proponent of industrialization, urbanization, and modernization in opposition to more moderate Bolsheviks like Kamenev and Sokolnikov.\n\nIn exile in France, Molotov proved to be a good diplomat - he organized all the meetings of the top leadership of the RCP with French leaders, including the leaders of the Jacobin and Sorel parties, and became one of the preachers of Bolshevism among the Jacobin party.\n\nNow, at the head of the state and the party, Molotov is ready to continue the work of Lenin and Zinoviev, albeit with minor improvements, which include forced industrialization and immediate collectivization, an emphasis on nationalism instead of internationalism, as well as a kind of cleansing of society from parasites and hostile elements with the help of labor camps and the Cheka."

### Events ###
bolsheviks.1.t:0 "The Bolsheviks Return" 
bolsheviks.1.d:0 "This moment happened. A moment that everyone, even the most committed socialists, feared. In Moscow, a plane landed, on board of which was a delegation from the top leadership of the Central Committee of the RKP. Grigory Zinoviev, the leader of the party since Lenin's death, his right-hand man Lev Kamenev, the main ideologists of the Proletkult - Lunacharsky, Bogdanov and Gastev, economists Grigory Sokolnikov and Yevgeny Preobrazhensky, successful organizers and diplomats Georgy Chicherin and Vyacheslav Molotov, the Kaganovich brothers, as well as the most dangerous man, terrifying all capitalists, Genrikh Yagoda.\n\nDespite all the horror that the Bolsheviks brought to Russia, they were not immediately arrested. They were met by a government car and soon they were placed in the Hotel Metropol. What was it all about? Why were these gentlemen not arrested, or at best executed, and their memory wiped from the face of the earth? Until recently, the Bolsheviks were the terror of all of Europe, but a small group of people who no longer had as much influence and were hated by many. They have no chance of seizing power."
bolsheviks.1.a:0 "It's a miracle if they succeed."

bolsheviks.2.t:0 "Calm Before the Storm?"
bolsheviks.2.d:0 "With the young republic being still too unstable, the decision of military leaders to give all the powers for Bolsheviks seems like madness. The Siberian Insurgency has already damaged the stability in the country, but now is situation is getting out of control. Peasants, who still remember the Red Terror, famine and fear, are starting to become nervous. Very-very nervous. We must expect further insurgency in whole our regions and we will have to deal with it as soon as possible.\n\nBecause if we fail, the Russia will even in a greater danger."
bolsheviks.2.a:0 "Everything's under control..."

bolsheviks.3.t:0 "Yagoda's First Move"
bolsheviks.3.d:0 "Cheka. One word. A great fear for the entire nation.\n\nIn the first months of the Civil War, a special institution was established to fight the 'counter-revolutionnaries'. By the end of 1918 it was already the primary organisation, responsible for Red Terror. Thousands of Russians were shot. All of them were against Bolsheviks and Revolution.\n\nWhen in 1920 the Bolsheviks lost the Civil War, the supreme leadership of the Cheka left as well. But they never stopped their activities. During all these 15 years the underground cells were active in Russia, directed by Cheka from abroad. By [GetYear] the leader of the Cheka in Russia is Genrikh Yagoda - a man with no principles, except one - everything for the revolution.\n\nWith the Bolsheviks in power, too weak now, Yagoda makes his first move - he sent the message to all local councils and his message was published in all newspapers. He stated that the Cheka organisation is now back and hiring volunteers to serve the state. And a warning below. Do not resist the Bolshevik Power. Otherwise, you will be punished."
bolsheviks.3.a:0 "Red Terror again?"

bolsheviks.4.t:0 "Peasant Riots"
bolsheviks.4.d:0 "Though the Bolsheviks has just begun their rule over Russia, the first resistance followed. In the prosperous lands of South Russia the Penza peasants began their rebellion. They demand that the Bolsheviks immediately give up power to the Soviets, consisting of socialists and that their individual power must end now. The local Chekists, Militia and even army has already arrived in the region, but still do nothing, awaiting the orders of Zinoviev."
bolsheviks.4.a:0 "First move of peasants..." 

bolsheviks.5.t:0 "The Congress of Soviets"
bolsheviks.5.d:0 "With the Bolsheviks return, the Congress of Soviets was called to decide on some major issues that Bolshevist leaders often quarell on. The supreme executive power is now in the hands of Sovnarkom - Soviet of People's Commissars. The government consists of the Chairman of the Sovnarkom - Grigory Zinoviev, People's Commissars of Economy, Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Education (Enlightenment) and others. The decisions, made at the Congress will directly affect the Sovnarkom and the policies, that will be implemented."\
bolsheviks.5.a:0 "The session begins."

bolsheviks.6.t:0 "Mayakovsky Returns From Georgia"
bolsheviks.6.d:0 "The futurist poet, known throughout Europe, Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky returned from Georgia, where he conducted the propaganda policy of the Proletkult. Although he is not a member of the party, he was invited to join the Congress of Soviets, where the supreme leadership of the RKP sits. Joining his colleagues, Lunacharsky and Gastev, Mayakovsky is ready to work for the benefit of the Motherland, inspiring the working class of Russia to labor feats, and... submission."
bolsheviks.6.a:0 "He's back."

bolsheviks.7.t:0 "The Peasant Riots Expand"
bolsheviks.7.d:0 "Our first measures were not enough to put down the rebellion, and now the discontent spreads across the regions. While heavily threatening our stability, other revolts will follow if we don't manage to overcome them in time."
bolsheviks.7.a:0 "The Cheka will deal with it!"

bolsheviks.8.t:0 "Proletkultisty Faction Emerges"
bolsheviks.8.d:0 "A faction of Proletcultists - active participants in the Proletkult (Proletarian Culture) program of Lunacharsky have united under his guidance in a small faction in the RKP. Represented by three main leaders, recently repatriated Vladimir Mayakovsky, technocrat and syndicalist Aleksei Gastev and a Proletkult Boss Anatoly Lunacharsky, the faction demands more funds in the Ministry of Education and Enlightenment, as well as beginning of the Second Russian Proletkult as soon as possible. While we cannot stop them, we can support them - and relocate funds to their ministry."
bolsheviks.8.a:0 "Full support for Proletkult!"
bolsheviks.8.b:0 "Right now we have more important matters..."

bolsheviks.9.t:0 "Sokolnikov Against Plan"
bolsheviks.9.d:0 "A prominent Bolshevik, Grigory Sokolnikov has recently held a speech at the Congress, denouncing the Preobrazhensky's Planned Economy. Claiming that the society and economy are not ready for such undertakings, Sokolnikov argued that a cautious and mild approach is needed. If we fail to appease the peasants, they will crush us in a rebellion. Therefore, Sokolnikov stated that Bukharin's NEP should be implemented, at least in the beginning. By doing so, we can expect less resistance from peasants and appease the socialist opposition."
bolsheviks.9.a:0 "An interesting proposal."
bolsheviks.9.b:0 "We won't change our program."

bolsheviks.10.t:0 "The Riot Spreads"
bolsheviks.10.d:0 "We were unable to suppress the riot and now it has spread to the region with Russian minority, sparkling national rebellions of Tatars and Bashkirs. This situation is getting much worse every hour, and if the Cheka is too weak to deal with it, what can we expect from other ministers?\n\nPerhaps, it becomes obvious that Sokolnikov's proposal of adopting NEP is not so bad after all."
bolsheviks.10.a:0 "A disaster!"

bolsheviks.11.t:0 "Peasant Riots Supressed"
bolsheviks.11.d:0 "The peasant riots seem to be finally suppressed by the forces of Cheka, once again proving that this is a powerful organisation that can do anything to secure the stability in the country."
bolsheviks.11.a:0 "Cheka tightens its grip over Russia."

bolsheviks.12.t:0 "The Riot Radicalizes"
bolsheviks.12.d:0 "The Cheka has once again failed to restore control in the regions of peasants and nationalities revolts. But now the situation has gone out of the control.\n\nA Triumvirate of three leaders of the Idel-Ural Tatar Nationalist organisations, Musa Dzhalil, Shafi Almas and Akhmet Temir, has declared the independence of Tatarstan and Bashkurdistan from the Bolshevist Russia. The local militia is already armed and ready to fight us on what they call their national territory. We must immediately crush them to avoid further national rebellions, but some of the RKP members suggest that we should not intervene and crush them later, when the country will be stabilized, avoiding possible war with Transamur."
bolsheviks.12.a:0 "Their state won't live for long."
bolsheviks.12.b:0 "Fight for independent Idel-Ural!"

bolsheviks.13.t:0 "The Tatars and Bashkirs Revolt"
bolsheviks.13.d:0 "The illegitimate government of Bolsheviks have caused the Tatars and Bashirs to rebel. The government, including [ROOT.GetLeader] suggest we should immediately intervene in the war, perhaps at a cost of losing these territories, but right now we have an advantage over forces of Bolsheviks. Perhaps it is our last chance to quickly overthrow them and restore our power over Russia."
bolsheviks.13.a:0 "Guarantee their independence."
bolsheviks.13.b:0 "Declare war on Bolsheviks!"
bolsheviks.13.c:0 "Neither we recognize them!"

bolsheviks.14.t:0 "Sokolnikov and Zinoviev Blamed in Revisionism"
bolsheviks.14.d:0 "The Congress Members, most prominent of whom are Preobrazhensky, current economy minister, joined by Kaganovich and Molotov have denounced the Zinoviev's support for Sokolnikov and accused both of them of revisionism and 'rightism'. Zinoviev though parried the Congressmens' thrust on him, claiming that his allegiance to Marxism is undoubtful, but this left everyone with a shady feeling though."
bolsheviks.14.a:0 "NEP? Never heard about it..."

bolsheviks.15.t:0 "Yagoda Demands Expansion of Cheka"
bolsheviks.15.d:0 "Genrikh Yagoda demanded the expansion of funds and subsidies to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and to be more precise, he wants to make the Cheka a larger and stronger institution. While this is an absolute threat to all non-conformists in Russia, it will possible secure our rule."
bolsheviks.15.a:0 "Subsidize the Cheka!"
bolsheviks.15.b:0 "No more money to Yagoda."

bolsheviks.16.t:0 "More Delegates Announce Support for NEP"
bolsheviks.16.d:0 "Each day more and more RKP members announce support for NEP as a possible choice at least for the first couple of years of the Bolshevist rule. The undeveloped industry, peasant riots and Russia being still a capitalist country affects the popularity and stability of our regime.\n\nHowever, talking about the Central Committee of the RKP and the SOVNARKOM, the opinions there are greatly polarized. The ones who support NEP are in minority. Among them there are Grigory Sokolnikov and Grigory Chicherin with Kamenev having an opinion of creating a homogeneous socialist government and, therefore, appeasing the other socialist parties, who, in majority, are in favour of NEP. On the other side there are Proletkultists, Molotov, Yagoda and Kamenev, who are denouncing the revisionists and looking forward implementing the First Five-Year plan. Zinoviev, personally looking towards the Planned Economy, is somewhat mistrusting every faction, which is not a good sign for the Chairman. But eventally, a formal decision should be made."
bolsheviks.16.a:0 "Announce support for the NEP."
bolsheviks.16.b:0 "Denounce NEP supporters for Menshevism."

bolsheviks.17.t:0 "The Question of Land"
bolsheviks.17.d:0 "Since the first Bolshevist decrees in 1917, the question of land was considered to be solved once and for all. However, with the NEP supporters arising in the party, it is once again debatable. While some believe that in terms of the NEP some private ownership must be saved, the majority of the Sovnarkom believes in immediate land nationalisation and destruction of capitalism in the village as soon as possible."
bolsheviks.17.a:0 "Some of private property shall be saved... for now."
bolsheviks.17.b:0 "Immediately nationalize the land!"

bolsheviks.18.t:0 "The Issue of Third Internationale"
bolsheviks.18.d:0 "While the Bolsheviks were in exile in France, they supported the syndicalist regimes, though claiming that their program shall stay the same and Trade Unions will be state-controlled, at least in Russia. With Bolsheviks now in power, they must decide if they stay with the Third Internationale in their struggle against capitalism and imperialism, or follow their own way of Bolshevism and found the Fourth Internationale."
bolsheviks.18.a:0 "We must respect our ties."
bolsheviks.18.b:0 "Fourth Internationale shall rise!"

bolsheviks.19.t:0 "Connections With Imperialists"
bolsheviks.19.d:0 "Some members of the Party suggest that while we are still in vulnerable position, we must cooperate with Imperialists countries and save our trading contracts and contacts. As expected, this view was suggested by Sokolnikov and supported by Chicherin. The other delegates, though, once again denounced this proposal as 'Imperialistic', 'Revisionist' and 'Menshevist'."
bolsheviks.19.a:0 "We'll need this connections for now."
bolsheviks.19.b:0 "Cooperating with Third Internationale is enough!"

bolsheviks.20.t:0 "Sokolnikov-Chicherin Opposition Grows"
bolsheviks.20.d:0 "With the Congress more and more accepting Sokolnikov's and Chicherin's ideas, two of them have decided to formally announce their Opposition Bloc. Sokolnikov-Chicherin Bloc, already been called 'Rightist Lean' by the other Bolsheviks, is looking forward creating a popular Economy, saving trade contracts with Capitalist countries and appeasing the peoples of Russia. The Bloc almost immediately gained a lot of support from peasants and common citizens, as well as from the other socialist parties, which are still active in our country."
bolsheviks.20.a:0 "Moderate Bolsheviks or Traitors of Lenin?"

bolsheviks.21.t:0 "The Congress Wants Zinoviev's Opinion"
bolsheviks.21.d:0 "With the establishement of the Rightist Lean Opposition Bloc, Zinoviev is now for some reason viewed as a solution to this problem. Though the final decision will still be made by the majority of the Congress members, those who will be supported by Zinoviev will be the likely winners.\n\nZinoviev understood that this decision is very serious and the stability of the party, as well as the stability of country in whole now depends on him.\nMoreover, the opposition was unofficially supported by Kamenev, Zinoviev's closest associate and a very influential Bolshevik. Having always been a supporter of homogeneous socialist government, Kamenev has seen the failure of Lenin and the first socialist revolution as a result of the RKP's previous unability to cooperate with other socialists.\n\nNevertheless, Zinoviev's final decision is..."
bolsheviks.21.a:0 "Support The Rightist Lean"
bolsheviks.21.b:0 "Follow the plan and denounce the opposition."

bolsheviks.22.t:0 "Proletkultisy Opposition Bloc"
bolsheviks.22.d:0 "The Proletcultists have announced their own opposition, based on the Proletkult ideals. Opposed to the Zinoviev's indifference and Yagoda's Cheka priority, they have stated that the best solution to the political crisis in the country is to immediately start Proletkult program and greatly expand it. The Proletarian Enlightenment will bring popular opinion about Bolsheviks as saviors of Russia from illiteracy, exploitation and oppression."
bolsheviks.22.a:0 "The party falls apart..."

bolsheviks.23.t:0 "Molotov-Yagoda-Kaganovich Troika"
bolsheviks.23.d:0 "After the formation of Rightist Lean Opposition bloc, Molotov, Yagoda and Kaganovich announced their triumvirate or troika. They denounced all the Central Committee members of the RKP, including Zinoviev and Kamenev and demanded immediate restitution of original RKP program and ban of any opposition inside the party. Moreover, they once again denounced NEP as 'Menshevist revisionism' and Proletkult as 'Bourgeouis Art Circle' and demanded immediate transition to the socialist society and implementation of planned economy.\nWith the establishement of Troika, the RKP party has finally found itself divided."
bolsheviks.23.a:0 "The Congress Will Decide."

With our rule still shaky, the Left SRs use any possibility to terrorize the nation and our party. This must be stopped as soon as possible. So, there are several choices and we must make one of them.\nThe first one is to ban the party and arrest the leaders, including Spiridonova and Kamkov. The second choice is to send them in exile to France, where they won't be able to influence us. The third choice is try to appease them by allowing some freedoms to other socialist parties to show that the New Bolsheviks are not that savages from the past."

The imperialists of Germany and America are already preparing to lay down their arms and be defeated, to realize the power and strength of the workers 'and peasants' state. Our allies in France and Britain are ready to assist us in the return of our fraternal peoples to their homeland-Ukrainians, Belarusians, friendly Baltic socialists.\n\nComrades! To achieve this goal, we need to rally around the Bolshevik party, because only the Bolshevik party can lead our country to victory - to the power of the workers and peasants! I appeal to the revisionists and the Socialist-Revolutionary-Menshevik opposition, as well as to the followers of the traitor Bukharin! Lay down your weapons, stop fighting. The Soviet government is already here and it will not leave. The government will be organized through the Soviets, under the supervision of the Council of People's Commissars. The enemies of the people will be brought to justice. Once again, citizens! Express your opinion through the Soviets of workers and peasants, and not through Bukharin-Socialist-Revolutionary-Menshevik revisionist nonsense!

This decision, however, was received ambiguously by some of the more right-wing members of the party. They were outraged by Zinoviev's decision to centralize power, as this contradicts Marxism.

proletkult.1.d:0 "With the end of the Congress of Soviets, a member of the Proletkultists factiom, [ROOT.GetLeader] became elected the Chairman of the Sovnarkom. The new People's Commissars were appointed soon and now we can start to implement our important policies in the territories of Russia. With the experience we have, the Cultural Revolution will be achieved in few years. The most important issues shall be soon decided on by the People's Commissariat of Enlightenment."
proletkult.1.a:0 "Long live the Proletkult!"

proletkult.2.t:0 "The Issue of Illiteracy"
proletkult.2.d:0 "The absence of Proletkult in republican Russia has led to the fact that most of the population of our country cannot be called literate. Even so, they are not literate from the point of view of proletarian culture. Various capitalist, bourgeois and philistine views have enslaved the consciousness of these people, which means that measures must be taken to proletarize their culture.\n\nThe new program within the framework of the Proletkult was called "Likbez" or the elimination of illiteracy. Active literacy training will begin, and the literate will be obliged to teach the illiterate through labor service. Illiterate students will be taught: to read clear printed and written fonts; to make brief notes necessary in life and official affairs; to read and write down whole and fractional numbers, percentages, to understand diagrams; the students will be explained the main issues of the construction of the Soviet state."
proletkult.2.a:0 "To be illiterate equals to be blind!"

proletkult.3.t:0 "Proletarian Ethics"
proletkult.3.d:0 "The so-called proletarian ethic is a necessary condition for the development of proletarian culture. Instilling a proletarian ethic will not be easy, but it is important - with the help of a powerful propaganda campaign of our ideas, we will achieve unprecedented success. Our proletkult program will be very powerful, such as the world has never seen before."
proletkult.3.a:0 "Long live the Cultural Revolution!"

proletkult.4.t:0 "Social-Futurism"
proletkult.4.d:0 "Mayakovsky proposed to introduce his own ideas into the Proletkult - what he calls Social-Futurism. He proposes to create a society of educated and talented people. Everyone should master any art - the one that he or she will like. Training in painting, and especially in modern styles, architecture, and music, will be necessary and mandatory for everyone, both adults and children. The creation of the Soviet intelligentsia is the ultimate goal of the Mayakovsky plan. And he sincerely does not understand and is not going to recognize the right of people to choose if they should do arts or not. 'Art is not a hindrance to work' - as Mayakovsky correctly put it\nThe only question is whether the People's Commissariat of Education will support such an initiative."
proletkult.4.a:0 "Full support for Social-Futurism"
proletkult.4.b:0 "That's somewhat... insane."

proletkult.5.t:0 "Soviet-Syndicalist System"
proletkult.5.d:0 "Aleksei Gastev, a scientist and proletarian who worked in Europe for many years, argues that the People's Commissariat of Education is obliged to put the issue of trade unions on the agenda. According to Gastev, Russia needs to combine the Soviet and syndicalist system of government. All economic power should belong to trade unions and autonomous collectives (syndicates) of workers, and all political power should belong to Soviets elected at all levels.\n\nGastev's ideas have surprised some people's commissars, but many recognize the success and viability of the syndicalist system of government. Perhaps in symbiosis with the Soviets, the system will work even better."
proletkult.5.a:0 "Full support for Soviet Syndicalism"

proletkult.6.t:0 "Proletarian Religion"
proletkult.6.d:0 "Lunacharsky, being a respected man, suggested that the People's Commissariat of Education return to his early ideas: the creation of a proletarian religion. Of course, many people are skeptical: after all, Marxism is equal to atheism. However, Lunacharsky insists on his own, as the head of the People's Commissariat of Education, he has the right to do so. Unless, of course, the ideas of Mayakovsky or Gastev are more preferred by the People's Commissars."

proletkult.7.t:0 "New Chairman of the Narkompros"
proletkult.7.d:0 "It is time to choose the new chairman of the Narkompros. The most possible candidate is likely to be the candidate, who has more influence and authority over Sovnarkom, and whose ideas are more liked by the People's Commissars. However, a compromissable variant can be made: fulfill the program of the new chairman, though implementing some ideas of the other candidates."

proletkult.8.d:0 "Mayakovsky has found himself at the very top: he's now the Vozhd of the Proletariat and Chairman of the Sovnarkom. Though he's not a member of the RKP, he decided to change the name of the party and become its new leader. In his first decree, the Communist party was renamed into Proletarian Party of Futurists and its main ideology was stated as Social-Futurism - a minor branch of Marxism. Though some did not like the changes, blaming Mayakovsky in revisionism - they were quickly silented by exclusion from the party. With PPF standing triumphant, Mayakovsky is standing firmly as the Leader of the Avant-Garde."

proletkult.9.t:0 "Social-Futurism"
proletkult.9.d:0 "For many members of the already modified party, it is not entirely clear what social-futurism is. Despite the fact that Mayakovsky made many speeches about the new ideology of the proletarian state, not everyone clearly represents the implementation of his projects in practice.\n\nIn fact, everything is much simpler than it seems. The main idea of social futurism is to create a society of talented and educated people, where everyone has mastered some art and is ready to work for the benefit of the Motherland and world socialism. Perhaps Mayakovsky's ideas are in many ways utopian and unrealizable - but with what optimism the people's poet strives for this goal!"

Admiring contemporary art is not a right or a desire, it is the duty of every law-abiding citizen who believes in socialism and hates the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe exhibitions will feature works by Kazemir Malevich, one of the leading figures of futurism and chairman of the Art Board of the Art Department of the People's Commissariat of Education, Marc Chagall , one of the leading avant-garde artists, as well as some works by Picasso brought from chaos-ridden Spain."

proletkult.11.t:0 "Free Master Classes"
proletkult.11.d:0 "Free clubs and master classes will be organized throughout the country, in which young and adult citizens of the proletarian republic will be taught the relationship of chromatic tones, contrasts and nuances of light and dark, black and white gradations, graphic means of line and silhouette, and the texture of the paint layer.\n\nIn addition to painting, young avant-gardists will be given lessons in dance and music, including modern futuristic genres. Music clubs will study the theory of music and sound, harmony, musical notation and musical forms. At the dance lessons, you will be able to learn harmonic movements and poses, plastic and facial expressions, tempo and rhythm, as well as master modern and popular genres.\n\nSpecial attention should be paid to literary circles: in Moscow and Petrograd, master classes will be given by Velimir Khlebnikov, Anna Akhmatova, Marina Tsvetaeva, Boris Pasternak and Daniil Kharms. There are rumors that even the master of verse, the thunderstorm of all capitalists and the genius of the poetic word, will perform at the literary master class in the capital: Vladimir Mayakovsky himself."

proletkult.12.t:0 "Theater and Cinema"
proletkult.12.d:0 "in all cities of Russia in the largest theaters will be free performances with the latest productions of Vsevolod Meyrehold, based on the plays of Mayakovsky. In the same cities where there is no theater yet, it was decided to immediately build and open to the public the so-called people's theaters.\n\nCinema is also rapidly developing. Thanks to the achievements of socialism, this year viewers across the country will be able to see Sergei Eisenstein's film "Alexander Nevsky"for free. In it, the Old Russian prince confronts the imperialist invaders of the Teutonic Order, who are referred to in the film as the Germans. Surprisingly, the main antagonist, the leader of the Teutonic Knights, was named Wilhelm. Is this a reference to the German Kaiser, or is it just a satire on inhumane capitalism? In any case, the film tells about the victory of the Russian people-ordinary peasants and workers, led by the Vozhd, who composes his words in beautiful verses."
proletkult.12.a:0 "Masterpiece!"

proletkult.13.t:0 "Obligatory Creative Education"
proletkult.13.d:0 "The resolution of the Council of People's Commissars, signed personally by Vladimir Mayakovsky, reads as follows:\n\nEvery citizen of the Proletarian Republic is obliged from an early age to learn any kind of art: painting, music, dance, acting, or literature. Attendance at children's clubs is mandatory and will be supervised by teachers and school principals. For adults, separate clubs will be organized, which they will be required to attend every week on weekends.\n\nThanks to the organized free exhibitions within the framework of the Proletkult, which contributed to the popularization of art among most of the citizens of the proletarian republic. Even though some of them are dissatisfied with this decision, the Council of People's Commissars knows better, doesn't it?"
proletkult.13.a:0 "We'll build a nation of the talanted!"

proletkult.14.t:0 "With Hammer and Sickle"
proletkult.14.d:0 "The new 'Soviet identity' must be forged with a hammer and sickle. The rich culture and history of all the peoples inhabiting the Proletarian Republic should undoubtedly be perpetuated in memory. But as for the present and the future, the Proletkult takes over.\n\nThe new Soviet identity is not just a brand in the passport of citizenship. This is a new Soviet culture, a new nationality and a new language.\n\nMeasures to internationalize the Russian language and the languages of national minorities, that is, to translate them into the Latin alphabet, are not enough. What is needed is a more radical reform of the language and its slow transformation into a new one: free from the yoke of capitalism, not imposed from outside. The new Proletarian language will be based on the Latin alphabet and use Latin roots to bring our peoples closer to the peoples of the socialist countries of France, Italy and England.\n\nSo far, the measures taken by the government are not enough, but soon, perhaps even in this decade, the schools of the Proletarian Republic will learn the grammar of the PROLYAZ - the Proletarian language."
proletkult.14.a:0 "New times need new methods."

proletkult.15.t:0 "Emergence of Soviet Intelligentsia"
proletkult.15.d:0 "Quite expected was the emergence of the Soviet intelligentsia - the most educated and honored workers of the Proletarian Republic-academicians, professors, scientists, inventors, artists and musicians.\n\nThe so-called party nomenclature was replenished with the ranks of new, successful citizens, ready for work and defense.\nIn other socialist countries, such inequality is unacceptable, but here is the whole point: in our republic, there will be no inequality of the intelligentsia and the common people. In our republic, there will be no ordinary people at all. The ultimate goal of our beautiful socialist society is to build it. Classless, without division into rich and poor, educated and uneducated, talented and untrained. Yes, they say that talent is an exceptional thing. But will you say it to Mayakovsky's face? Of course not."
proletkult.15.a:0 "Every man an Intelligentsia!"

proletkult.16.t:0 "Repressions Against Philistines"
proletkult.16.d:0 "Many did not take seriously the demands of the Council of People's Commissars and Chairman Mayakovsky on compulsory creative education. Moreover, even if they did, it wasn't serious. They did not put enough effort into mastering the art. This is what causes the inequality and higher position of the intelligentsia. Do you think they deserve it? Perhaps. But this is unacceptable for a socialist state that bears the proud name of a Proletarian Republic!\n\nFrom now on, and forever, the avoidance of creative activity will be prosecuted with all severity. Citizens who have given up creative activity will work for the benefit of the motherland in labor camps: build new river channels, build hydroelectric power stations, plant forest belts. They will not be useless as before. If they dare to criticize the government's decisions, their fate will be more severe. They will be shot for treason, for their pettiness, commercialism, laziness and lack of talent.\n\nRemember, citizens! The party does not forgive you for your laziness. Labor has made a man out of an ape, and creativity has made a superman out of a man. The party will never forgive you for this."
proletkult.16.a:0 "If you don't respect our rules - why should we respect yours?"

proletkult.17.t:0 "Great Construction Projects of Communism"
proletkult.17.d:0 "Man must be a friend and a brother to nature. But before we can move on to such a relationship, we must tame and conquer nature. Nature will serve us as a good friend if we learn to use its rich land resources, to irrigate it with rivers and lakes, generously provided to us.\n\nThe Great Construction Projects of Communism - that's what the Council of People's Commissars called the projects that we will soon have to make. The main and key ones are undoubtedly the connection of the Baltic and White Sea through the White Sea-Baltic Canal, the connection of Moscow and the Volga through the Mayakovsky Canal, the connection of the Don and Volga through the Volgodonsk Canal, as well as the turn of the Siberian Rivers to irrigate the barren and arid lands of Central Asia. The construction of hydroelectric power stations on many rivers will give us a lot of energy, which we use for the benefit of the people."

proletkult.19.d:0 "With the election of Comrade Gastev as chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, he issued a decree on the immediate transition to his program 'Ustanovka'.\n\nAs part of the program, Syndicates will be created throughout the country - systematic associations of workers, industrial sectors and organizations. The All-Russian Committee of Trade Unions, the VKPS, was given executive power in the fields of economy, finance, industry and trade. With the decree adopted, the People's Commissariat of Economy and Finance was abolished, and all its People's Commissars were dismissed.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the reform is to create a Soviet-syndicalist system of government, in which all political power belongs to the Soviets, and all economic power belongs to the trade unions and syndicates. In order to avoid a conflict of interest, Gastev was appointed the new chairman of the VKPS. He will oversee both the political and economic decisions of the branches of government.\n\nIn addition, by Gastev's decision, the RKP is renamed the RSPRP - the Russian Syndicalist Trade Union Labour Party. All members of the RKP who do not agree with the current policy will be excluded from the party and ostracized."

proletkult.20.d:0 "The Russian worker is no different from the European or American worker. Why, then, are production efficiency and labor productivity higher in their countries? It's all about standardizing production. In our country, we will create a standardization of labor.\n\nThe Russian worker does not know fatigue or sleep. He works all day for the success of his country. At least, that's what they say, but it's not true, because the Russian worker was a real slave. He used to work for the success and wealth of a capitalist. Now everything will change. Everyone gets tired. With a clearly distributed time, the worker will not get tired, and observing safety precautions, and most importantly-knowing how to work correctly, his productivity will increase significantly."

proletkult.21.d:0 "Many believe that it is impossible to change the mentality of an entire nation. However, what if there is no longer any nation? In our international state, there is only a worker. The worker has no nation, he has only labor. Work that makes him well-fed and contented, and his state-strong and powerful. We are going to change the foundations of society. Down with the church! Down with the kulaks! Down with the bourgeois elements! It is necessary to take measures for the urgent collectivization of the village, the destruction of the kulaks and the promotion of the idea of proletarianism and labor!"

proletkult.22.d:0 "Comrade Gastev is convinced of the need for systematic work on the study of labor processes in order to improve them. To this end, it is necessary to create a Labor Institute. He outlined the structure of the Institute of Labor at the VKPS and the methodology of its work. The Central Institute of Labor was recognized as 'an institution for the development, demonstration and promotion of the principles of scientific organization of labor and training of the labor force'.\nThe main activity of the CITA will be the problems of rationalization of methods and methods of work, training of workers. Gastev's 'Labor Attitudes (Ustanovki)' doctrine will introduce an original technology of vocational training — the "CIT system", focused on standardized, accelerated, programmed and mass training of skilled workers. This method is based on training workers in certain, most rational labor techniques for manufacturing products on the basis of dividing operations into techniques and movements, studying them and selecting the most rational ones.\n\nA special syndicate, called the 'Ustanovka' under the Gastev program, will be organized under the CIT, it will send specialists-consultants to introduce innovations in scientific work at enterprises. Foreign specialists from France and Britain will also take part in the organization of the syndicate's work. The instructors will work in all sectors of the national economy."

proletkult.23.d:0 "Tectology is a science formulated by A. Bogdanov, one of the prominent ideologists of the Proletkult in the 1920s in exile. It didn't get much attention from the public, but it caught Gastev's attention.\n\nIn accordance with the fundamental assumptions of tectology, two or more elements included in a single process can, with a special organization (organization), exceed the effectiveness of the functioning of these same elements separately. These ideas formed the basis of the Soviet-Syndical system.\n\nAs practice shows, the system works well, largely due to the leadership of Gastev, as a balancing element in the political system.\n\nIn addition, Bogdanov introduced the concept of technical intelligentsia. These are the most educated and successful people in our republic, who should be at the head of certain departments and manage the rest. This is exactly what is happening now, but the engineers have been joined by academics and scientists who are familiar with objectivity, empirical evidence, and progress."

With the Gastev program, our country has already achieved unprecedented results, and everything is still ahead. We have increased labor productivity several times, and the workers have finally begun to live normally and receive decent wages.

Under his leadership, hundreds of employees work hard for the benefit of the motherland.\n\nMany people no longer know where Lunacharsky started - what ideas inspired him to work and develop every day to achieve general humanistic goals. Instead, with his closest associate, Alexander Bogdanov, he could sit for hours, talking about what he had not publicly mentioned or written about for a long time.\n\nAnd so, on one of these beautiful days, during an ordinary conversation, Anatoly asked: 'Alexander, but still, in your opinion..."

Now, at the highest level, this decision has been made and will soon be implemented.\n\nBut this is a religion - not a religion in the ordinary sense of the word. This is something more than a belief in fairy tales. The proletarian religion is the belief in a different God. The one who moves our society forward - Progress. The one who brings our society together - Collectivism. And most importantly - the one who allows it all to become true - the Reason."

proletkult.27.t:0 "Age of Reason"

Many turn to Christianity, where the church deceives them and takes away the last thing they had. Within the framework of de-Christianization, we will not kill the priests, although this is the best that could comprehend them. They will be required to adopt a new religion, and if they refuse, they will be arrested and spend their entire lives in labor. The old temples and churches will no longer serve the liars. From now on, these will be Temples of Reason and Truth, where people will be able to find the right answers to questions from the point of view of science and progress, and Marxism, of course."

And his ideas will live forever. Now officially the ideology of our party is called Marxism-Leninism. Lenin is not just a true revolutionary, a courageous man who fell victim to the counter-revolutionary terror of the Social Revolutionaries, but also the main personification of the revolution and socialism. He died for a great idea - a society without masters, where everyone is equal and there is no exploitation, oppression and property. A society where a person does not own a person. It was Lenin who showed us the path of true equality - what we should strive for. Even though he is no longer with us, we will always remember that he sacrificed his life to make our lives better.\n\nLet the exaltation of the memory of the national and international hero, the savior of all the weak and the poor, begin.

According to his letters to close friends, Anatoly saw Alexander Bogdanov as his successor. The Central Committee of the party decided to respect the last will of the chairman and unanimously voted for the appointment of Bogdanov as the new chairman.

Not everyone agrees with the adoption of Bukharin's doctrine, and considers it revisionism and the same betrayal that Bukharin committed many years ago. Sokolnikov has a lot to change in the personnel of the Central Committee of the RKP, if he wants to succeed, otherwise the more radical Bolsheviks can remove him."

sokolnikov.2.d:0 "Despite the fact that Chairman Sokolnikov is undoubtedly a convinced Bolshevik, with his acceptance of Bukharin's NEP program, his loyalty to the party began to be doubted. Many openly call him a revisionist and Bukharinist, and even accuse him of Menshevism. Of course, such an image does not contribute to the popularity of Sokolnikov, which means that urgent measures are needed for 'Debukharinization'.\n\nUndoubtedly, Sokolnikov is not an adherent of Bukharin's ideas, moreover, despite the fact that they began their journey together, Bukharin's betrayal and his decision to kowtow to Kerensky and the bourgeois-democratic government of the Petrograd regime, greatly shocked Sokolnikov. However, he could not but recognize the viability of the NEP in the early years of the transition to full-fledged socialism.\n\nIn this regard, urgent measures will be taken to ostracize Bukharin, delegitimize his party, which will be banned, and all activists will be arrested for anti-state activities. Bukharin's face will hang in every yard, crossed out and with a huge inscription TRAITOR TO SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM!"

sokolnikov.3.t:0 "Reaffirm Trading Contracts"
sokolnikov.3.d:0 "Our young republic needs to abide by trade agreements with other powers, including capitalist ones, until we can take care of ourselves. Like other decisions of Sokolnikov, this is one of the most controversial. Many believe that since we accept money from the capitalists, they can sponsor our economy on their own terms. Of course, this is not the case. Moreover, what could be better than the fact that the imperialists and capitalists pay the Socialist state, and therefore sponsor socialism?"

At the same time, the Kulaks, who are naturally exists because of the 'Capitalism in the city' principle of NEP, are gonna pay more taxes at a progressive rate proportional to their income.\n\nBy implementing this tax, we will ensure social and economic equality in the village and stop Kulaks from becoming too wealthy."

sokolnikov.9.d:0 "The Chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee is nominally the highest state position in the Republic of Soviets. It became such in connection with the death of Sverdlov and the appointment of Mikhail Kalinin back in 1919. During the reconstruction of the Soviet government, the VTSIK, as well as its chairman, were restored, and Mikhail Kalinin again headed this authority. [ROOT.GetLeader] suggests that Mikhail Kalinin is a promising Bolshevik who can is capable of more useful work. As the head of the executive branch, he will have approximately the same powers as the President of the Russian Republic - that is, to represent Russia abroad, along with the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In many ways, his position will remain, of course, decorative, but the government led by [ROOT.GetLeader] will be under the head of the VTSIK."

molotov.1.d:0 "In his first speech as head of the party, Molotov announced the new course of the country - national Bolshevism.\n\nFor many delegates, this concept was not available for understanding, and therefore, the chairman made a theoretical justification for the new ideology of the party.\n\nNational Bolshevism proceeds from the obvious fact that only Bolshevism and the Bolshevik party can pull the country out of medieval feudalism and chaos. In the civil war, reaction won - and the republic was doomed. For 20 years, the peasants waited for land, and the workers for factories. But the landlords and capitalists who retained power were only enriched by German handouts.\n\nThe time of pain and suffering of our people is over. Only Bolshevism can save them. Not the syndicalism inherent in the Western countries, nor the Socialist-Revolutionary-Menshevik capitalism, nor the revisionism of Bukharin. Only one party, unjustly expelled and excommunicated from the people, can change life in the country. And this is the party of the Bolsheviks."
molotov.1.a:0 "Bolshevism will prevail."

molotov.2.t:0 "Council of Labour and Defense"
molotov.2.d:0 "The Council of Labor and Defense was first established in November 1918, in the midst of the blazing civil War. The Council served as an emergency "national economic cabinet", issuing emergency decrees in an attempt to support industrial production for the Red Army in the face of economic collapse.\n\nHowever, the Council of Labor and Defense did not live long, as did the power of the Bolsheviks. With the end of the civil war, the council was dissolved. However, now, according to Molotov, the council should be restored, because, as the chairman said, we are still in a state of civil war. Peasant uprisings, small-nation uprisings, capitalists and imperialists, revisionists and opportunists, Trans-Amur traitors-all are ready to take advantage of the weakness of the Soviet republic and tear it apart.\n\nThe Labor and Defense Council will be restored. And it will be headed by Chairman Molotov. Our economy will develop by leaps and bounds, collectivization and industrialization are waiting for us - and the faster the better for us and the worse for our enemies."
molotov.2.a:0 "War is coming."

molotov.3.t:0 "The Efremovites"
molotov.3.d:0 "Mikhail Efremov was just a peasant from the collective farm "Iskra" of the Beloglazovsky district of the Altai Territory on the border with hostile Mongolia, became the owner of the world record yield (he received on an area of 3.6 hectares 61 quintals of wheat per hectare, and on 8.5 hectares — 54 quintals).\n\nWith his feat of organizing labor and defense of the republic, Yefremov inspired many other collective farmers, thus becoming the initiator of the movement of the country's foremost agricultural leaders for high yields. The movement has become incredibly popular, and it is quite possible that soon many citizens will be inspired by the feat of Efremov and become leaders in their industries. The movement has already received the name "Efremovites" after the initiator, and Efremov himself was appointed chairman of the kolhoz."

molotov.4.t:0 "With A Hammer Blow"
molotov.4.d:0 "Molotov, whose party pseudonym literally translates as 'Hammer', gives great importance to labor and defense. Having replaced the hammer and sickle with a symbol of totalism - and at the same time a symbol of labor and defense - the sword and hammer, Molotov is ready to continue his program.\n\n'With a blow of the hammer' is the new motto of all the proletarians and peasants of the country. Only with a cold look, in the sweat of our brow, can we become stronger and more secure. We need to immediately increase the rate of production, and the sooner the better."

molotov.5.t:0 "Declaring War on Unemployment"
molotov.5.d:0 "During the Kerensky regime, unemployment only increased every year, but those days are long gone. In our state, there will be no unemployment at all. It's very simple. Until recently, unemployed people were only condemned and subjected to social ostracism, they did not want to communicate with them, because they are not ready to serve labor and socialism. However, now everything has changed. The Council of Labor and Defense proposed to introduce administrative penalties, including fines and arrests for the unemployed, but Chairman Molotov proposed a more ingenious idea. After all, you can't argue that the unemployed are parasites. And when they run out of money to pay fines, they will sit under arrest - and rest.\n\nMolotov proposed to toughen the punishment and make it criminal. But no, they won't shoot anyone. Instead, labor camps will be created in which convicted parasites will work for the benefit of the country. The so - called General Management of the camps, under the leadership of both the Council of Labor and Defense and the Cheka, will control the work of prisoners."

molotov.6.d:0 "It is still too early to talk about a complete victory, but the foundation has already been laid. Thanks to the triumph of the sword and the hammer, our country is successfully developing from an agrarian semi-feudal backward state into an industrially developed socialist state. National Bolshevism, as a belief in the Bolshevik party and in the peoples inhabiting the territory of the former Russian Empire, triumphed in the minds of ordinary people. They realized how right the Bolsheviks were in their endeavors, how wise and clever the great chairman Vyacheslav Molotov is."

This decision was criticized by some non-essential party members, who, however, soon changed their minds. However, the so-called "fraternal triumvirate" of Michael, Lazarus, and Julius was created with the aim of creating a centralized government as part of Kaganovich's fight against dissent."

kaganovich.2.t:0 "Choosing Our Direction"
kaganovich.2.d:0 "Since the People's commissariats of the national economy and internal affairs are now under the rule of the Kaganovich brothers, Lazar must choose which of the brothers he can count on more. Mikhail, on the one hand, is a rather hot-tempered person who does not seriously focus on work, on the other hand, Julius is really a talented security officer. However, the situation in the country should also be taken into account. It is full of spies and various counter-revolutionaries, but on the other hand, the economy, already destroyed by the German henchman Kerensky, is completely fucked up. It is necessary to make a decision on what to focus on."

kaganovich.3.t:0 "A Drunk Brawler"
kaganovich.3.d:0 "Lazar Kaganovich was stunned by the news that his brother Mikhail, moreover, the People's Commissar of the National Economy, was in the drunk tank last night. Like a real rowdy, Mikhail, having got drunk in the 'Rumochnaya', began to shout near the street Solyanka in Moscow 'the Internationale'. Residents of nearby houses complained about the night noise and the good thing that they called the police, and did not call directly the Lubyanka, which is only half an hour on foot. The police officer who arrived at the scene found the People's Commissar lying on the ground, seemingly unconscious, drunk in a frenzy. But in his usual manner, Mikhail was only joking. When the policeman approached the drunk and began to shake him, trying to bring him to his senses, Mikhail quickly opened his eyes and laughed in the face of the dazed policeman. Of course, soon after that, he was detained and taken to the local drunk tank in the Kitaygorodsky district. There the People's Commissar safely slept through, and in the morning, as if nothing had happened, went to work.\n\nNow he sits with a guilty face in front of the chairman, and assures him of his innocence."

kaganovich.4.t:0 "Another Incident"
kaganovich.4.d:0 "Lazar Kaganovich was informed that his brother Mikhail, who was also the People's Commissar of the National Economy, had failed all the deadlines for the delivery of an important agricultural object. At work, Mikhail joked a lot, shouted at the top of his voice, and did everything from playing checkers with local peasants to tipping a glass of rural moonshine. This behavior of the People's Commissar, of course, is irresponsible and destructive. Mikhail had already been warned that he would be removed from his leadership position in the party and expelled from the Central Committee. However, he did not listen to the advice and continued to behave like a ridiculous child. By the decision of the congress, it was unanimously decided to expel Mikhail from the Central Committee and appoint a more suitable person to this position - Nikolai Krestinsky.\n\nEyewitnesses say that Mikhail endured his resignation hard, ranging from a heavy drinking binge, ending with the denial of Marxism and cursing Lenin, Zinoviev, Bukharin, Yagoda, Molotov, Kamenev and, finally, his own brother Lazar. This was not good for anything, so by the decision of the party, Mikhail was appointed to the post of director of the aviation plant, where he would have been at least a little happier."
kaganovich.4.a:0 "Well, every family has one black sheep."

kaganovich.5.t:0 "No Happy-End"
kaganovich.5.d:0 "Lazar Kaganovich was informed that today at 6 o'clock in the morning his brother Mikhail, the director of the aviation plant, was found shot dead in his own office at the plant. Despite the fact that there are no clear reasons for what he did there so early, forensic experts agree that Mikhail did not leave the plant in the evening. Left alone with an expensive foreign cognac, Mikhail drank a bottle, and, being in an extremely intoxicated state, took a gun out of his pocket. After lighting a Cuban cigar, he sat down in a chair and wrote a suicide note in a barely legible hand. In it, he said that he could no longer live, having lost the chair of the People's Commissar. He also wrote about how great it was for him to live in exile in France and that he is very sorry that he returned to his homeland. Unable to cope with the amount of work, Mikhail decided that he was no longer needed by the country, but he remains committed to the cause of Lenin to the end.\n\nHis body was delivered in a closed coffin to Moscow, and a farewell ceremony will take place soon."
kaganovich.5.a:0 "Rest in peace, brother."

kaganovich.6.t:0 "Moscow Metro"
kaganovich.6.d:0 "In Moscow, the second stage of the metro opened, thanks to Kaganovich's enhanced measures for the renovation of the new capital. Back in the 1920s, with the assistance of the German company Siemens Bauunion, the Kerensky government was able to find funds for the construction of the first line of the Moscow subway. The line stretches from Ostozhenka Street to the square of Three Railway Stations. Following the plan drawn up by the Germans, Lazar Kaganovich, together with Gosplan, built new sections of the Moscow metro in record time. The new line stretched from Bryansky Railway Station to Kursky Railway Station through the center of the capital, passing under Red Square, where a huge transfer hub was built for the third line - from Rzhevsky Railway station to Saratovsky Railway Station.\n\nThis is not the end of Kaganovich's renovation, as a huge plan was made for the renovation of Moscow - watering its rivers and landscaping. New metro lines will also be opened soon."
