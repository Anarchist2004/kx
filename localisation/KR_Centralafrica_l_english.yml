### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_BOKASSA_EMPEROR_DESC:0 "Even in the wake of one nation’s imperial ambitions turning to ash and cinder, history stops for no one, and a new empire has already begun to blossom here in Africa. Born in 1921, the young Askari Jean-Bédel Bokassa took the destiny of Ubangi-Shari in his hands, leading a fanatical group of veterans and recruits against the dying German colonial machine. With his victory earned and the people of Bangui at his back, the young Bokassa has taken the reins of this former colony and has begun to forge it into a mighty empire - the first of its kind in post-Collapse Africa. Though he has already begun to receive criticisms for his peculiar appetites and violent tendencies, the people still adore their savior and hero in Bokassa. Taking the full title of ‘His Imperial Majesty Bokassa the First, Apostle of Peace and Servant of Jesus Christ, Emperor and Marshal of Central Africa by the will of the Central African people, united within the national political party, the MESAN’, this young soldier-turned-rebel-turned-emperor shall lead the lands of Ubangi-Shari and beyond into a new dawn as the rightful Emperor of Central Africa."
POLITICS_BOKASSA_LEADER_DESC:0 "Jean-Bédel Bokassa, though young and inexperienced in any form of statecraft or leadership, has defied the odds and helped lead his people to independence. Though only born in 1921 and taking up the honored role of an Askari auxiliary just a few short years ago, Bokassa has proven his tenacity and cunning, if also sadism, in his brutal war against the German colonizers. With their colonial monstrosity of Mittelafrika burning, Bokassa has begun to be seen as a new unifying figure and national father to the dispersed and disparate peoples of Ubangi-Shari, and as he endeavors to bring stability to this war-torn land, he shall create a newly independent state of which the people of Africa have never seen."

### Ideas ###
CEA_split_larp:0 "Who to Idolize?"
CEA_split_larp_desc:0 "Jean-Bédel Bokassa, our national father and savior, has been torn between two competing influences. Long fascinated with monarchism and with strong imperial figures, the young Bokassa has fervently modeled his practices on both Napoleon Bonaparte, first French emperor, and Frederick the Great, the most honored Prussian king. Divided between these two identities, the young ‘Emperor’ must soon pick a path to follow and a titan to emulate, lest his regime drift aimlessly without direction."

CEA_inferiority_complex:0 "Desire for Greatness"
CEA_inferiority_complex_desc:0 "Despite his young age and inexperience when it comes to ruling a nation, Bokassa has nevertheless come to control all of Central Africa. From his base of power in Ubangi, this young Emperor now requires an empire to rule over. This greatness shall not be denied to him, and he is willing to cut through anyone and anything to earn his prize."

CEA_emperor_without_empire:0 "An Emperor with No Empire"
CEA_emperor_without_empire_desc:0 "With our borders secured and the foundations of the Bokassa regime now cemented, the young Emperor has begun to look outward for new worlds to conquer. Eyeing up the Kamerunians to the West, who have long been embroiled in a never-ending stalemate, Bokassa believes he has found a perfect target to serve as the site for our first imperial expansion."

Our proud leader, Jean-Bedel Bokassa has secured a large supply of fresh and hearty; albeit strange tasting meat to feed our populace. The source of this protein is still a mystery, but with a fed populace and a nourished army, the question of this meat’s origin is of little importance.\n After all, what you don’t know can’t hurt you... right?"

CEA_yong_dictator_desc:0 "Mittelafrika, the greatest colonial project this world has ever seen; has been swept into the dustbin of history; in its place rises dozens of new warlords and rival governments. Our new 'State' of Ubangi-Shari will have many tribulations to overcome if it is to survive, as we forge the difficult path of building a nation. With former Askari Commander Jean-Bédel Bokassa at its helm, and with his loyal Uncle Barthélemy Boganda heading the civilian government, we shall survive and thrive in the chaotic climate of post-collapse Afrika."
CEA_opening_consolidation:0 "Consolidate the Countryside"
CEA_opening_consolidation_desc:0 "Ubangi-Shari is a volatile warlord state headed by Bokassa's officer clique; and has little control outside of the capital of Bangui. Securing our hinterlands against the roving bands of bandits and disloyal tribes is a priority for our regime. If we are to survive, controlling the entirety of our territory with a firm grip is a must."
CEA_rally_people:0 "Rally the People around Bokassa"
CEA_rally_people_desc:0 "Few outside of Bangui have even heard Bokassa's name, nor know of the greatness he is responsible for; we must spread the word of Bokassa to the uneducated.

With our hold over the nation secure, we alone now hold the ability to turn the tide of the war in Kamerun. Our leader, seeking greatness has proclaimed our intervention in this conflict; who will we side with? the Socialists of the Adamawa Clique, or the German Remnants to the West?"

CEA_a_german_leader:0 "Heir of Frederick"
CEA_a_german_leader_desc:0 "Germany may have failed to maintain their grand Empire - however they still remain one of the most powerful nations that this world has ever seen. Keeping that in mind, Bokassa has modeled his new Empire off of the mighty German Reich; and has sought inspiration from Frederick the Great; one of Germany’s greatest soldiers who managed to defend his homeland against all odds. All of Africa shall bow before Jean Bedel Bokassa’s mighty new imperium. "
CEA_army_with_state:0 "An Army with a State"
CEA_army_with_state_desc:0 "On the lines of Prussian tradition, Ubangi-Shari shall become a model of militarism in Africa.

CEA_our_german_roots_desc:0 "While the French continued to influence the region of Ubangi-Shari even after Germany took command; Jean Bedel Bokassa has embraced the German roots of our nation to its fullest extent. In that vein, Jean Bedel Bokassa has rejected his French education and has moved to master the German language. Additionally, Bokassa will move to ban the French Language and aspects of French culture will be actively prohibited, as we move to further Germanize our nation. "
CEA_black_mans_prussia:0 "The Black Man's Prussia"
CEA_black_mans_prussia_desc:0 "Do we not perfectly mirror the great Kingdom of Prussia? One part of a greater whole, destined to unite our brothers under one banner.

CEA_a_french_leader:0 "Heir of Napoleon"
CEA_a_french_leader_desc:0 "The death of Bokassa’s father at the hands of a German officer has left him with a life long inferiority complex towards the German Empire; however he has saw first hand the failure of Germany in Africa. In response to their failure, Bokassa has instead turned to the French; Ubangi-Shari’s former master and a land that continued to influence Bokassa despite not ruling over his homeland. France shall be the source of inspiration for Bokassa’s new Empire, and Napoleon shall be our model. In addition, we shall seek closer accommodation with the government of France in Exile, maybe even standing side by side with them when they move to liberate their homeland. "
CEA_a_proper_empire:0 "A Proper Empire"
CEA_a_proper_empire_desc:0 "While Africa has a long history of tribal monarchies; none of them could ever hope to match the glory of Bokassa’s new realm.

When we have finished, our magnificent empire will be the envy of all of Africa. "
CEA_first_consul:0 "The First Consul"
CEA_first_consul_desc:0 "Bokassa is no premier, no chief, no king; he is an Emperor, our nation’s mighty First Consul and commander of the Central African Empire.

CEA_french_culture:0 "Our French Heritage"
CEA_french_culture_desc:0 "While Germany was our most recent colonial overlord; the mighty French Empire has ruled over our lands longer than any other power. Despite the German Empire gaining the territory of Ubangi-Shari after the Weltkreig, the influence of France continued to run deep within our lands; with our own Bokassa even being educated in French. Instead of fighting the influence of France, we shall instead embrace it, moving to import elements of French culture and officializing the teaching of French within our schools. "

The party was founded Barthélemy Boganda; and was co-opted by Jean-Bédel Bokassa when he seized control of Ubangi-Shari. It stands for nationalist and quasi-religious ideals that seeks to affirm black humanity against European dehumanization. While Bokassa has commanded the party with an iron fist, and sought to destroy opposition to it, the simple fact is that MESAN is the only real political force within the nation; and for better or for worse, MESAN would stand as the only real governing party for our nation even if Bokassa were to be deposed.

A "morality brigade" will be formed in the capital to monitor bars and dance hall; polygamy, dowries, and female circumcision will also be abolished. Finally, Bokassa also opened a public transport system in Bangui made up of three interconnected bus lines through the capital city as well as a ferry service on the Ubangi River, as well as subsidizing the creation of two national orchestras."

When war does break out to the west; we will not be caught with our pants down, we will vanquish our foes with superior tactics and technology. We will take on the Kamerunians in every theater of warfare; and by god we will win"
CEA_strike_first:0 "Strike First!"
CEA_strike_first_desc:0 "We will not give the Kamerunians the satisfaction of starting this inevitable conflict; we will strike first at those rats, trampling their feeble soldiers under our boots, smashing their pathetic defenses into dust and ash.

Canibalism is obviosly taboo and most people within our government have no love for this practice, seeing it only as a desperate means to feed our people.

Under this young revoltee, the lands of Ubangi-Shari have been freed from the clutches of vile imperialists and colonizers, and now Bokassa seeks to advance his own ambitions. \n\nLong has this charismatic, inexperienced soldier dreamed of an empire of his own as he grew up in the shadow of the Kaiser, and now with the region’s capital in his hands and the will of the people behind him, Bokassa can do just that."

However, we must make sure that we do not fall into a dynastic crisis when you eventually pass on...’, the advisor trailed off, not wanting to anger His Majesty. ‘Thus, the idea of establishing a formal harem of local women for you, sire, has been brought up in many meetings’ he began again, shaking as the nerves of talking to his flippant Emperor rocked him to his core, ‘and as such I felt it prudent to deliver the suggestion to you. They would surely be honoured to meet you.’ \n\nBokassa had sat, quietly and unmoving, at this sudden interruption, but could not help but to be delighted by the end of the trembling servant’s advisal. Though he wanted to execute this fool upon his entry, his soothing and wise words have allowed cooler heads to prevail. ‘Make it so’, the Emperor decreed before going back to his lounging..

The only royals in attendance were Prince Emanuel of Liechtenstein, and the representative of the exiled Monegasque house of Grimaldi; who were the only royals in the world to enthusiastically endorse Bokassa's claim of royalty.\n\n The Coronation itself was held in a hastily repaired stadium in downtown Bangui, which had been elaborately decorated for the occasion; however the stadium’s lack of Air Conditioning led to discomfort among the many guests wearing elaborate suits and dresses. Bokassa himself arrived dressed in a white toga, with white antelope skin gloves covering his hands, and a golden wreath upon his head. Upon ascending to the elevated platform, guardsmen handed him attributes of imperial power: a sword and a two-meter sceptre, which Bokassa took in his right hand. Then several pairs of guardsmen brought a long velvet mantle to the throne, and one of them put it on the Emperor. After this, Bokassa himself placed the crown on his head.

Colonial era prisons and barracks were captured during the first days of the collapse; with the many inhabitants being slaughtered and processed into consumable protein, which was later distributed to the populace.\n\n Now that our situation has greatly stabilized, our government is left with a choice; gradually phase out cannibalism, replacing our ‘Pork’ with a more sustainable protein, or continue the charade; keeping our population well fed, no matter the means.

After all, what is a truer sign of power and prowess than the hunting and cooking of your fellow man? And surely there are some talented chefs in the area who are willing to keep a secret... "
