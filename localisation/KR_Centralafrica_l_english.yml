### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_BOKASSA_EMPEROR_DESC:0 "Even in the wake of one nation’s imperial ambitions turning to ash and cinder, history stops for no one, and a new empire has already begun to blossom here in Africa. Born in 1921, the young Askari Jean-Bédel Bokassa took the destiny of Ubangi-Shari in his hands, leading a fanatical group of veterans and recruits against the dying German colonial machine. With his victory earned and the people of Bangui at his back, the young Bokassa has taken the reins of this former colony and has begun to forge it into a mighty empire - the first of its kind in post-Collapse Africa. Though he has already begun to receive criticisms for his peculiar appetites and violent tendencies, the people still adore their savior and hero in Bokassa. Taking the full title of ‘His Imperial Majesty Bokassa the First, Apostle of Peace and Servant of Jesus Christ, Emperor and Marshal of Central Africa by the will of the Central African people, united within the national political party, the MESAN’, this young soldier-turned-rebel-turned-emperor shall lead the lands of Ubangi-Shari and beyond into a new dawn as the rightful Emperor of Central Africa."
POLITICS_BOKASSA_LEADER_DESC:0 "Jean-Bédel Bokassa, though young and inexperienced in any form of statecraft or leadership, has defied the odds and helped lead his people to independence. Though only born in 1921 and taking up the honored role of an Askari auxiliary just a few short years ago, Bokassa has proven his tenacity and cunning, if also sadism, in his brutal war against the German colonizers. With their colonial monstrosity of Mittelafrika burning, Bokassa has begun to be seen as a new unifying figure and national father to the dispersed and disparate peoples of Ubangi-Shari, and as he endeavors to bring stability to this war-torn land, he shall create a newly independent state of which the people of Africa have never seen."

### Ideas ###
CEA_split_larp:0 "Who to Idolize?"
CEA_split_larp_desc:0 "Jean-Bédel Bokassa, our national father and savior, has been torn between two competing influences. Long fascinated with monarchism and with strong imperial figures, the young Bokassa has fervently modeled his practices on both Napoleon Bonaparte, first French emperor, and Frederick the Great, the most honored Prussian king. Divided between these two identities, the young ‘Emperor’ must soon pick a path to follow and a titan to emulate, lest his regime drift aimlessly without direction."

CEA_inferiority_complex:0 "Desire for Greatness"
CEA_inferiority_complex_desc:0 "Despite his young age and inexperience when it comes to ruling a nation, Bokassa has nevertheless come to control all of Central Africa. From his base of power in Ubangi, this young Emperor now requires an empire to rule over. This greatness shall not be denied to him, and he is willing to cut through anyone and anything to earn his prize."

CEA_emperor_without_empire:0 "An Emperor with No Empire"
CEA_emperor_without_empire_desc:0 "With our borders secured and the foundations of the Bokassa regime now cemented, the young Emperor has begun to look outward for new worlds to conquer. Eyeing up the Kamerunians to the West, who have long been embroiled in a never-ending stalemate, Bokassa believes he has found a perfect target to serve as the site for our first imperial expansion."

CEA_fresh_meat:0 "Fresh Meat"
CEA_fresh_meat_desc:0 "While many in the remains of Mittelafrika face the looming possibility of starvation and famine, the people of [CEA.GetNameDef] have to deal with no such fears. Our proud leader, Jean-Bedel Bokassa has secured a large supply of fresh and hearty; albeit strange tasting meat to feed our populace. The source of this protein is still a mystery, but with a fed populace and a nourished army, the question of this meat’s origin is of little importance.\n After all, what you don’t know can’t hurt you... right?"

CEA_yong_dictator_desc:0 "Mittelafrika, the greatest colonial project this world has ever seen; has been swept into the dustbin of history; in its place rises dozens of new warlords and rival governments. Our new 'State' of Ubangi-Shari will have many tribulations to overcome if it is to survive, as we forge the difficult path of building a nation. With former Askari Commander Jean-Bédel Bokassa at its helm, and with his loyal Uncle Barthélemy Boganda heading the civilian government, we shall survive and thrive in the chaotic climate of post-collapse Afrika."
CEA_opening_consolidation:0 "Consolidate the Countryside"
CEA_opening_consolidation_desc:0 "Ubangi-Shari is a volatile warlord state headed by Bokassa's officer clique; and has little control outside of the capital of Bangui.

If we are to survive, controlling the entirety of our territory with a firm grip is a must."
CEA_rally_people:0 "Rally the People around Bokassa"
CEA_rally_people_desc:0 "Few outside of Bangui have even heard Bokassa's name, nor know of the greatness he is responsible for; we must spread the word of Bokassa to the uneducated.

CEA_a_german_leader:0 "Heir of Frederick"
CEA_a_german_leader_desc:0 "Germany may have failed to maintain their grand Empire - however they still remain one of the most powerful nations that this world has ever seen. Keeping that in mind, Bokassa has modeled his new Empire off of the mighty German Reich; and has sought inspiration from Frederick the Great; one of Germany’s greatest soldiers who managed to defend his homeland against all odds. All of Africa shall bow before Jean Bedel Bokassa’s mighty new imperium. "

CEA_a_french_leader:0 "Heir of Napoleon"
CEA_a_french_leader_desc:0 "The death of Bokassa’s father at the hands of a German officer has left him with a life long inferiority complex towards the German Empire; however he has saw first hand the failure of Germany in Africa. In response to their failure, Bokassa has instead turned to the French; Ubangi-Shari’s former master and a land that continued to influence Bokassa despite not ruling over his homeland. France shall be the source of inspiration for Bokassa’s new Empire, and Napoleon shall be our model. In addition, we shall seek closer accommodation with the government of France in Exile, maybe even standing side by side with them when they move to liberate their homeland. "
CEA_a_proper_empire:0 "A Proper Empire"
CEA_a_proper_empire_desc:0 "While Africa has a long history of tribal monarchies; none of them could ever hope to match the glory of Bokassa’s new realm.

Despite the German Empire gaining the territory of Ubangi-Shari after the Weltkreig, the influence of France continued to run deep within our lands; with our own Bokassa even being educated in French. Instead of fighting the influence of France, we shall instead embrace it, moving to import elements of French culture and officializing the teaching of French within our schools. "

The party was founded Barthélemy Boganda; and was co-opted by Jean-Bédel Bokassa when he seized control of Ubangi-Shari. It stands for nationalist and quasi-religious ideals that seeks to affirm black humanity against European dehumanization. While Bokassa has commanded the party with an iron fist, and sought to destroy opposition to it, the simple fact is that MESAN is the only real political force within the nation; and for better or for worse, MESAN would stand as the only real governing party for our nation even if Bokassa were to be deposed.

He and his native Askari loyalists have the support of the native African population at his side, for long has this colony chafed under the rule of the Germans and French before them. Under this young revoltee, the lands of Ubangi-Shari have been freed from the clutches of vile imperialists and colonizers, and now Bokassa seeks to advance his own ambitions. \n\nLong has this charismatic, inexperienced soldier dreamed of an empire of his own as he grew up in the shadow of the Kaiser, and now with the region’s capital in his hands and the will of the people behind him, Bokassa can do just that."

Decorated in the finest and most lavish decor and finery we can get our hands on and constructed in a similar style to the great palaces and mansions of the Ottomans, Egyptians, and Europeans, this new construction shall serve as the center of Bokassa’s regime and as his new favorite place in the nation. From atop its towers or within its pelt-lined and marble-walled sanctums, the honorable Bokassa I shall rule over all of Ubangi-Shari and all who reside within it."

However, we must make sure that we do not fall into a dynastic crisis when you eventually pass on...’, the advisor trailed off, not wanting to anger His Majesty. ‘Thus, the idea of establishing a formal harem of local women for you, sire, has been brought up in many meetings’ he began again, shaking as the nerves of talking to his flippant Emperor rocked him to his core, ‘and as such I felt it prudent to deliver the suggestion to you. They would surely be honoured to meet you.’ \n\nBokassa had sat, quietly and unmoving, at this sudden interruption, but could not help but to be delighted by the end of the trembling servant’s advisal. Though he wanted to execute this fool upon his entry, his soothing and wise words have allowed cooler heads to prevail. ‘Make it so’, the Emperor decreed before going back to his lounging..

Alternatively, siding with Germany seems insane after just freeing ourselves from their yoke, but many within our regime closely hold dear the sentiment that it is ‘better to be dead than Red.’ The final choice is, of course, up to our young leader Bokassa, but a choice must be made soon while the fires of war are still fresh."

The only royals in attendance were Prince Emanuel of Liechtenstein, and the representative of the exiled Monegasque house of Grimaldi; who were the only royals in the world to enthusiastically endorse Bokassa's claim of royalty.\n\n The Coronation itself was held in a hastily repaired stadium in downtown Bangui, which had been elaborately decorated for the occasion; however the stadium’s lack of Air Conditioning led to discomfort among the many guests wearing elaborate suits and dresses. Bokassa himself arrived dressed in a white toga, with white antelope skin gloves covering his hands, and a golden wreath upon his head. Upon ascending to the elevated platform, guardsmen handed him attributes of imperial power: a sword and a two-meter sceptre, which Bokassa took in his right hand. Then several pairs of guardsmen brought a long velvet mantle to the throne, and one of them put it on the Emperor. After this, Bokassa himself placed the crown on his head.

Colonial era prisons and barracks were captured during the first days of the collapse; with the many inhabitants being slaughtered and processed into consumable protein, which was later distributed to the populace.\n\n Now that our situation has greatly stabilized, our government is left with a choice; gradually phase out cannibalism, replacing our ‘Pork’ with a more sustainable protein, or continue the charade; keeping our population well fed, no matter the means.

While Bokassa and his inner circle have mostly kept from consuming the protein themselves, Bokassa has heard stories told by certain individuals; individuals who swear that secret societies dedicated to the consumption of human flesh both existed, and operated in Africa under the German Empire’s watch.\n\n While most of these claims are surely hyperbole meant to demonize the Germans, the prevalence of these myths may be having an ironic opposite effect, with Bokassa; ever eager to emulate great European powers, perhaps embracing cannibalism to a degree that goes past a desperate measure meant to feed the population. After all, what is a truer sign of power and prowess than the hunting and cooking of your fellow man? And surely there are some talented chefs in the area who are willing to keep a secret... "

These leaflets have confirmed the suspicions of many on the true source of Bokassa’s pork, namely that the protein wasn’t pork at all, but rather the flesh of our own fellow man...\n\n While many hoped that this was some sort of cruel joke - the nation’s worst fears have been confirmed by Barthélemy Boganda, Bokassa’s uncle and long-time MESAN leader; the man who has been the de-facto head of [CEA.GetNameDef]’s civilian government for some time.\n\n The reaction to this revelation was swift, with a rash of suicides by soldiers and civilians following immediatley in the aftermath. The prisons where unfortunate souls were processed into usable proteins were quickly abandoned by their keepers, with the guards and those complacent vanishing into the savannas and jungles in an attempt to escape justice. The remaining prisoners managed to finally escape their hell, making their way from these out of the way prisons; and triumphantly uniting with friends and family, who have often searched high and low for those who have disappeared. While certain men and women were lucky enough to escape before they met their horrifying fate - hundreds, if not thousands individuals weren’t so fortunate.\n\nSoldiers of the Emperor quickly moved against him and his cannibal circle following the revelation after finding many frozen and maimed human corpses in the kitchen of Bokassa’s palace. Bokassa himself was executed by his own men shortly after the news became public, with Barthélemy Boganda being proclaimed as Central Africa’s new President as the former Central African ‘Empire’ crumbles into dust.

While Bokassa has had a great presence within French Forces, this influence has been effectively extinguished.

Upon entering, our soldiers found hundreds of quiet and empty rooms; rooms which were almost completely devoid of life and expression, aside from a few spare servants left behind. It seems as if the majority of Göring’s force had been evacuated the previous morning, with only a skeleton crew of soldiers left to put up a fight. The only person of note that our men could find was one Carl Schmitt; who was found locked in a closet in Göring’s office; completely strung out on methamphetamines and near death. He had been shot several times during the battle and was left for dead, breaking in to Göring’s personal supply of drugs in an attempt to ease the pain. Our soldiers ended dealt with him swiftly by slashing his throat with a sabre.\n\n Göring himself was nowhere to be found within the castle, with all signs pointing to him having evacuated the night before. However, just as hope for finding Africa’s most hated man seemed to have been lost, the hum of aeroplane engines beaconing from the castle’s runway alerted a detachment of soldiers to his presence. After making the trip to behind the castle where the runway was located, they tracked down their man, Hermann Wilhelm von Göring; who was attempting to board his personalized Messerschmitt Bf 109 in a futile attempt to escape. While by the time the soldiers noticed him his aircraft was already accelerating for takeoff, almost 40 soldiers running towards the runway and in the path of his plane; which threw his aircraft off balance, and led to his plane crashing into the ground before it could become airborne. Upon its return with the ground, the craft went careening towards a tree; an accident which totaled the plane. Göring himself (unlike his crew) managed to survive the crash, but laid barely alive; with a brave soldier finally ending his pitiful existence by putting a revolver to his skull and pulling the trigger."

Search after search turned up nothing of note; interrogations of his men led nowhere, almost 30 different body doubles were proven to be fakes, and every village in the area surrounding Obama’s camp was turned upside down; all for nothing. Despite all of our tireless work, we have come up empty handed.\n\n While weker men would give up, Bokassa knew Obama would soon slip up, and he would eventually be proven right. A double agent led our men to a meeting of Obamaist fanatics on Mt. Kenya; with an rumoured appearance from the man himself. And shockingly, it turned out that they were correct; as Obama himself emerged from the shadows like a phantom, delivering a imposing speech to his men, then disappearing back into the thicket.\n\n Once we were alerted to his presence,our brave soldiers scaled the mighty mountain and advanced on Obama and his encampment.\n\n We knew he was close, however even though the soldiers captured many of his compatriots and collaborators, there was no sign of the man himself on the entire mountain. In attendance for the raid was the Emperor himself, who sought to personally capture the African revolutionary and ‘Bring him to Justice’; or at least his version of it. Upon coming up empty handed, Bokassa wandered off from his detachment to pace and smoke a cigar. Unbeknownst to him, the Mzee himself was hiding behind a bush not even 10 feet away from his greatest foe...\n\n While the Mzee could have tried to escape with his tail between his legs, he must have known it would be a futile endeavor, giving up any attempts to escape, and attempting to take out the his greatest enemy before he went. Obama emerged from the bushes with a sabre in his hand, moving quietly around the mad emperor; concealing himself in the dark, maneuvering away from the soft light of Bokassa’s cigar. Just as the Mzee readied to make the kill; he took a step too far, stepping on a twig and alerting the Emperor to his presence.  Bokassa sprung into action, dislodging a custom forged and engraved knife from his belt and swiftly severing his opponent’s jugular in one fell swoop.\n\n Upon defeating his would-be assassin, he called over his men for aid; and upon inspecting his body in the dim light of the lanterns, they concluded that Bokassa had found and killed the mighty Mzee himself.

With each passing minute, Jomo only grew more anxious, wide-eyed, and feral in his fear as the terror squads of the Emperor’s Troops and their path of utter destruction reached him. Despite having no quarrel with Kenyatta, perhaps being even more of a sellout than him, the Mau-Mau soldiers that he employed to hunt down Kenyatta held unyielding hatred for the man that betrayed The Great Leader and everything the Mau-Mau and the Kenyan people hold dear when he bent the knee to the foreingn colonizers. And while Bokassa too betrayed the great Mzee, the soldiers who fought in the battle were willing to fight for Bokassa’s due to his offer to help kill Kenyatta in exchange for a full pardon\n\nWith the sounds of the maelstrom that unfolded outside his final bastion subsiding, Jomo breathed a sigh of relief, believing, if even just for a second, his troops were victorious. Then all hope faded in a flash of white phosphorus and hellfire. After seconds that felt like millenia, Kenyatta opened his eyes after a cacophony of noise, light, and vitriolic chemicals drowned out his senses and blocked the world from his perception, shocked only to see the bloodied, mutilated corpses of his loyal askari guard strewn about the shack he had decided to make this ‘valiant’ last stand. \n\nThen, in a flash, it was over. Without a final, grandiose speech or apology, without even a final word, the leading soldier stepped forward before Kenyatta even could clearly make sense of his newly demolished surroundings and decapitated the traitorous snake in one quick action - a far too quick a death for this scum. Jomo Kenyatta’s last words were but a mere whimper mixed with the smell of him relieving himself in panic and sound of cold steel meeting the flesh of a vile pig."

The soldiers that found him at first did not believe that the man was truly him, predicting his ‘capture’ to be some sort of trap. However as they took the man who was supposedly Bell off to a local station, they managed to confirm that this man was truly who he repeatedly claimed to be.\n\n Bell spend the final hours of his life conversing with the squadron of soldiers who were sent to capture him in their native French, touching on a broad variety of subjects with the men; subjects which they could both relate to, yet at the same time find completely alien. The soldier assigned to execute him grappled with the decision to follow through with his order; however after a great internal conflict decided to continue on with the mission.\n\n He snuck up behind Bell after he had finished his lively discussion with the troops; retiring to a tattered couch in the station and quietly reading the final pages of a book. The soldier moved behind him, being as quiet as possible; but despite precautions, there was no doubt that Bell would be aware of his impending fate. Despite his death appearing imminent, he continued to read, advancing through the final pages of the book, finishing the last page before the soldier raised his machete up high, and decapitated him in one swing.\n\n The soldiers shared an awkward ride back to Bangui with Douala-Bell’s body, not knowing how to remark on the strange event that they had just witnessed.

The Portugese detachment managed to gun down the detatchment of Bokkasa’s soldiers attacking the docks; and despite bombs being hurled at the boat from every clearing, the vessel departed from the port, and continued down the mighty Congo basin. While the boat’s thick steel hull resisted bombing, the ships integrity lasted for only a few miles, as soon the framework of the ship began to buckle, and water began filling the craft’s lower levels. While the squadron of Portuguese sailors assigned to guide the boat attempted to patch the breach, it ultimately proved futile, as the boat began rapidly capsizing.\n\n Just before the boat vanished beneath the Congo’s choppy waves, the Mainkongo and a handful of Portuguese soldiers escaped in a lifeboat, hoping to land on shore and slowly make their ways to a loyalist encampment. Before they made it to shore, a number of stray soldiers who had been following the craft in a comendared fishing boat arrived on the lifeboat’s side.\n\n\ When the Central African soldiers opened fire, Portuguese soldiers responded valiantly; even managing to kill and wound most of the soldiers on the boat. However by the end of the confrontation most of the riverbourne soldiers soldiers lay dead, and due to the damage sustained in the firefight, both vessels sunk to the river’s icy floor.  "

These soldiers told many stories of horror, of bad conditions and cruel commanders, with members of the Leopoldville Garrison mentioning, and indeed holding particularly venomous hatred for one ‘Petit Maniaque’ - one Émile Janssens.\n\n The fall of the city bearing his beloved Leopold’s name has thrown him into a fury, with the ‘Petit Maniaque’ being prone to random and blindly violent acts of rage, with random beatings and slur laiden tirades being common for soldiers in his ranks. These bouts of savage outrage have come to a climax as black soldiers besiege the city’s FP Barracks, defeating even the most well-trained white officers within the force.\n\n During the final stages of the battle, the few remaining defenders were faced with a critical lack of ammunition; which has led to Janssens abandoning his rifle and resorting to running around the barracks armed with nothing but a large club, blindly bludgeoning any black soldier that comes across his path - even if they are under his own command.\n\n The final seconds of the battle saw Central African soldiers triumphantly break through the main entrance to the main building, however by the time they reached Janssens, they were caught off guard when they found out that the ‘Petit Maniaque’ already laid dead - with his death not being a result of a bullet wound.

The driver turned to Ryckmans, told him that the stop was an opportunity ‘stretch his legs’, before exiting the car himself.\n\n The tree refused to move, the driver debated turning around; however the Emperor’s troops had a great presence in Likasi; it would be safer to continue forward towards Élisabethville. There was an airport not under control of Bokassa’s men, they could board a Saab 90 Scandia, and fly back towards the homeland; everything would be over, Ryckmans could surely publish a book about the experience. As the group stalled in their attempts to get back on the road, Ryckmans nervously scanned the clearings, eyeing up any would-be attackers.
