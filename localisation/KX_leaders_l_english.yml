After many years of witnessing the crimes of the Russian Tsardom a young Ioseb joined with local revolutionaries, making a name for himself he proved to be a natural leader and fighter. When the Russian Civil War broke out he led his comrades in battling enemy forces, alongside Grigol the two Georgians became infamous for their efficiency and also brutality. As the war progressed Ioseb fled to Georgia, joining the coalition government and proving himself as an intelligent economic advisor.\n\nAfter launching a coup of his former comrade and declaring himself Chairman of the nation, he now possesses the ability to reshape his country’s destiny under the ideology of Georgian Socialism.

POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC:0 "Born as Alfred-Georges Gressent, to a working-class peasant family in 1878, Georges was invested in politics from an early age. Becoming an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel whilst working as his secretary, however he was not always a man of the left. After publishing political thought directly inspired by his mentor, Sorel, he became an acquaintance of monarchist writer Charles Maurras. Joining Maurras’s movement, Action Française, he developed his ideology of fusing working-class based politics with monarchism. In 1911 he founded the Cercle Proudhon with fellow AF comrades, this group espoused national-syndicalism, integral nationalism and antisemitism whilst rejecting liberal and conservative democracy. Overtime as syndicalist movements evolved throughout France, the Cercle became overtly left-wing whilst maintaining an aggressively nationalist stance on world politics. When the French Civil War broke out, Valois took advantage of the crisis by turning his group into a fully fledged political movement. The Sorelians were born, disowning any previous reactionary views, Valois and his comrades took to streets of a broken France to demand the destruction of the French Third Republic.\n\n Now he has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny. He has also advocated for vengeance against Germany and the reclamation of lost French territory."
POLITICS_MARCEL_DEAT_DESC:0 "Marcel Déat was born in 1894 to a modest family, in his youth he excelled at his studies and became involved in left-wing politics. A student of Radical politician Émile Chartier he joined the SFIO,  however this political stint came to end when the Weltkrieg broke out. A staunch patriot he enlisted in the French Army and saw active duty, earning the Legion of Honour and five bravery citations. The Weltkrieg shaped his political views, forging a deep hatred for Germany and the French elite who he saw as failing the nation. During the lead up the French Civil War, Déat has positioned himself to the right of the socialist movement, advocating for an authoritarian anti-capitalist state. His work was published by Valois who had taken interest in Déat and the two became fast allies, when the General Strike led to civil conflict Déat declared loyalty to the Sorelans.\n\nRepresenting the ‘Vanguardist’ faction of the Sorelians, Déat has proved himself to be an opportunist first, and ideologue second. Forging connections with former political enemies and taking action against fellow comrades, Déat has fought his way to the top of the Sorelian leadership. Now in control of the National Worker’s State, Chairman Déat can lead the authoritarian anti-capitalist regime he always envisioned."
POLITICS_MARCEL_BUCARD_DESC:0 "Many things Marcel Bucard has been called over the years. Syndicalist, Anti-semite, Nationalist, Worker. Beginning life as the son of a butcher in Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, Marcel Bucard initially studied to become a Catholic Priest. This all changed however with the outbreak of the Weltkrieg where he patriotically signed up to fight off the German horde in defense of the French nation rising through the ranks and winning admiration for fellow french patriots and friends in the trenches. No matter how hard he fought however the horrors of the war cemented his personal hatred for Germany and its mistreatment of the French people. Originally a reactionary, the Weltkrieg provided him with a deep hatred for the French upper-class who he saw as cowards for surrendering to the Germans. The revolutionary period that swept France saw the Bankers, Liberals, Capitalists, the exploiters of the French nation abandon it and flee with the riches of its people. Countering this was of the utmost personal importance to Bucard who joined Valois’s Sorelians, eventually taking leadership of his own faction, the ‘Ultranationalist-Syndicalists’. Giving speeches towards crowds of disenfranchised French patriots against 'Ruthless banking clans' and their 'Liberal lapdogs' he easily recruited among the galvanized Weltkrieg veterans.\n\nNow in control as the Chief of the National Worker’s State, Bucard sees the destruction of the German Empire as his main objective. To him, the superior French proletariat have smashed the chains of their masters and can no longer be defeated by any force!"

He would go on to join the French Section of the Workers’ International at the age of 19. His time in the SFIO introduced him to Marxist thought, causing him to become enamored with the ideas of Communism and a very enthusiastic supporter of the Bolshevik uprising in Russia. The ultimate failure of the Bolsheviks led Thorez to conclude that they had not been pure or strong enough, that they had failed both Lenin, Marx, and Robespierre by their inability to take every measure necessary for the revolution. Thorez would take up arms in the Second French Revolution, declaring himself as a syndicalist to disguise his true communist nature. A charismatic leader, many flocked to him for his bold speeches and devotion to the Revolution. Once the Commune of France had been established, however, he revealed his true colors, declaring the Commune a bourgeois fourth republic, and converting his followers to the ways of communism. Now calling themselves the “Jacobins” after the radicals of Robespierre, Thorez and his followers became an immense thorn in the side of the CGT. Considering himself to be the successor to Robespierre and Lenin, Thorez would be dismissed as a political failure for his inability to win a seat in the CGT. But now with his rule secured by his astounding victory in the 1936 elections, the “political failure” is determined to live up to his predecessors and crush all who stand in his way of creating a true Communist French utopia."
POLITICS_FRENCH_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "With Chairman Valois now dead, power has been vested within the Sorelian Council. Valois never named his successor in the event of his death, therefore to avoid further conflict the Comité de Salut Public was formed. Chaired by Peirre Laval, the council lacks unity with it being split between two competing factions. Valois’s secretary, Marcel Déat leads the Vanguardists whilst commander of the Revolutionary Legion, Marcel Bucard, leads the Ultranational-Syndicalists. With the threat of anarchy looming, can the council unify behind a single leader or will it collapse..."

Laws and authority is enforced by fully autonomous communes which are usually commanded by a worker’s council. However despite this supposed unlimited freedom and abolition of all hierarchies, the most powerful man in the nation is undoubtedly Nestor Makhno. His role as the protector of anarchy allows him command large numbers of Black Guard soldiers who station themselves across the Free Territory. When his men require rest and food the citizens of communes oblige, Makhno chooses to not involve himself in the politics of anarchist communes however it would be unwise to challenge any decision he could make..."
POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC:0 "Born into a military family, 20 September 1872, Maurice Gustave Gamelin was always destined for military greatness. Entering into the Saint-Cyr Military Academy he graduated first in his class, going on to serve in Tunisia. Serving as attaché to future Marshal of France, General Joseph Joffre, this position provided Gamelin with a solid knowledge of strategic and tactical warfare. During the Weltkrieg he distinguished himself for helping plan the victory at the Battle of the Marne. Quickly being promoted all the way to Brigadier General however with the German offensive of 1918 pushing further and further into France, Gamelin was recalled to Paris. Leading a desperate defence of the capital he held the lines just long enough for a civilian extraction saving countless lives. After the war he maintained a high ranking position in the military, as civil tension escalated he refused to allow politics to sway his loyalty to France. When the syndicalist revolutionaries were successful, Gamelin offered his services to the government and was made Marshal of the Commune of France. This came to an end when the Jacobin regime was declared.\n\nAs the Jacobin rule of tyranny tore France apart, Gamelin realised that his backseat in politics must end. Forging an alliance Léon Blum, a Popular Front backed by the military, has overthrown Thorez’s dictatorship with Gamelin proclaimed as Maréchal. Many now regard Gamelin as the defender of Communard democracy, and saviour of France."
POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC:0 "Born into a poor peasantry family in Ukraine, 26 October 1888, Nestor Ivanovych Makhno was forced to adapt quickly to a harsh life. Extreme poverty led to him finding work for himself, being employed at a local iron foundry he witnessed the rise of revolutionary anti-Tsarist politics. Having experienced the Tsarist Regime’s brutality himself he joined local anarchists and took part in robberies resulting in his imprisonment. When the Weltkrieg broke out he remained a prisoner, sentenced to death by hanging, this came to end with the Russian Revolution. Being freed he left for Ukraine, forming connections with anarchists he established the ‘Black Army’ to fight against both Ukrainian nationalists and the intervening German forces. When Germany secured its dominance of the nation he fled his homeland for France.\n\n Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his popularity and notability in French politics. Forming the ‘Black Guard’ terrorist organization which has now overthrown the Sorelian regime. With the failures of Ukraine and France, Makhno has been further radicalised by the Illegalists. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the foreseeable future. However his efforts to destroy any remnants of authority in the commune with the establishment of the ‘Free Territory of France’ have so far been successful. These successes may be in vain however, for his personal army of anarchists are the only thing that can prevent France’s neighbours from taking advantage of this chaos..."
POLITICS_ROMMEL_DESC:0"The Kaiser has appointed Generaloberst Erwin Rommel as Mittelafrika’s new Statthalter. During the Weltkreig he served in Italy and was awarded the Pour le Mérite. He Served in the infantry, though he would later come to identify with a much more powerful form of warfare, Armoured Warfare. This however gained him many enemies within the High Command, who wanted to keep Germany practicing more traditional forms of warfare. After he published a renowned book on warfare, the Kaiser sent him to Africa to keep him out of the way of the High Command. However, this only strengthened his position in the high command as his doctrine of armoured warfare was perfectly suited the vast African plains. And now, with the Statthalter gone Rommel has been primed to take charge over Mittelafrika, and with him in Charge Mittelafrika’s warfare will be brought into the modern age. "

POLITICS_HONGWU_DESC:0 "Once abandoned by the world and left to rot in obscurity, the Marquis of Extended Grace Zhu Yuxun has returned to prominence and now sits on the Dragon Throne as the first Ming Emperor in over 300 years. Born in 1882 as the son of the former Marquis of Zhu before him, Zhu Yuxun was once lavished in the courts of Beijing as an honored guest and confidant to Puyi. With the arrival of the Germans, however, Zhu Yuxun was cast out from his paradise-like life of extravagance and forced into hard exile, spending these passing years hiding out in Manchuria.

POLITICS_KAZEMBEK_DESC:0"Little would have predicted that Alexander Kazembek would end up in the position he is in today. It seems as if his life may just be a lesson on the instability of the universe; of the chaos of politics and human existence. Born to a noble Iranian-Azerbaijani family, Kazembek saw the brunt of the Russian Revolution; something that undoubtably shaped his eccentric political views. However, instead of turning him against the Soviets, the Revolution endeared in him a certain level of respect for the Soviet System. And even though the Red Revolution failed; Kazembek still incorporated parts of the Soviet Ideals into his personal politics. \n\n His Charisma and experience as an Orator put him at the forefront of the new “Young Russia” group, a group that rejected Reactionary Tsarism in favour of a “New and Dynamic Vision”. As the situation in Russia deteriorated, Professor Nikolai Ustryalov convinced Party Secretary Kazembek to side with Alexander Kolchak and his coup against the Petrograd Government. Kolchak’s coup however failed; resulting in the creation of the state of Transamur; the rump state where Kazembek and Ustryalov fled to. These series of events led to Ustryalov and Kazembek rejecting the ideology of the Whites in favour of the Bolsheviks. This idealization lead to the development of the concept of a “Labour Monarchy”, and a system that combines Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". And as his Ideology grew and Changed, so did the influence of the Mladorossi within Transamur. Their influence grew and expanded, to a point where they could seize power following the Anti- Kolchak Coup. \n\n Now, Kazembek stands as the “Vozd” of the Rump State of Transamur. And though his influence may be currently small, Kazembek has plans to restore the Tsar, and soon reclaim all of Russia "
POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_MLAD_DESC:0 "Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, now Kirill I of Russia, is one of the most troublesome members of the House of Romanov. Strong-willed, ambitious, and determined to seize the throne, he has caused a headache to his first cousin, Nikolay II, several times. It is an open secret that during the February Revolution, Kirill actively worked against the Tsar and the rest of the House, even to the point where he ordered his men to raise the red flag above Petrograd - not because of any dedication to revolutionary ideals, but because of the hopes that he would become regent, or possibly even Tsar, after his cousin's abdication. \n\nAfter the execution of Nikolay and his family, Kirill claimed his rule over the scattered house of Romanov, a claim which was hotly contested by the rest of the family, who claimed that Kirill had no right to a restored Russian throne nor to lead the Russian royal family. By 1929, however, he was ultimately recognized, the untimely death of Grand Duke Nikolay certainly helped. While Kirill begrudgingly pays lip service to the Mladorossi, it truly doesn't matter to him who holds the keys to power; as long as he is in charge in some form. Even if Kirill is under practical House Arrest, and not but a powerless figurehead compared to Vozd Kazembek"
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_PURISHKEVICH_DESC:0 "Vladimir Purishkevich was born on August 24th, 1870 to an impoverished noble family. Despite his beginnings, he was able to earn a degree in classics, and his interest in politics only grew from there. In 1905, during the Russian Revolution, he was one of the principal founders of the powerful Black Hundredist movement. At the time, the movement suffered from crippling infighting, and Puriskevich himself had several rivals in the organization. Puriskevich had a role in the 1916 killing of Grigori Rasputin, believing his influence on the Tsarina and the country as a whole to be too dangerous to ignore. He developed many of his strongly anti-semitic, nationalist, and monarchist views during the Russian Civil War, in which he came to believe in an open fight against Jewry. \n\nWhen the Civil War ended, Puriskevich was not idle. His restlessness and charisma were powerful tools that he used to great success in propelling the RNSMA to national status, but they remained a fringe organization due to the existence of the republic. Now that they are in power, this situation has changed. Though he is old, Puriskevich will not squander the opportunity he has been waiting for for decades. His plans to restore the Russian Empire to greatness as one nation under one tsar will not be stopped by any means, and he will see to it that Russia is no longer the laughing stock of the world."

However, there seems to be little evidence to back up her claims; other than extravagant (yet accurate) stories of here life on the old Imperial Court. She has become a decisive figure within the Romanov Family; some have let her back into their lives, while others scoff and turn away. Regardless of the Royal Court’s opinions, the central Government never took here claims with a hint of seriousness... Until now.\n\n The results of the monarchy referendum have conclusively shown that the most widely accepted claimant to the throne became Anastasia. And when the time came to restore the Monarchy, she was the one chosen to reclaim the legacy of the Tsars. So, long live Tsarina Anastasia! Long Live the Russian Empire!"

Disney moved to Hollywood in 1923 to work in the Cartoon Industry and because his brother was convalescing from Tuberculosis there. Disney married Lillian Bounds in 1925 after hiring her as an Ink Artist. They had one Daughter biologically and adopted the other. In the early '30s Disney begun his career in Politics and, voiced his support for the Republican party of California. Something that made him a rising player in California’s regional politics. With the outbreak of the civil war, Walt pledged his full support for the Pacific Government and declared his intent for the Presidency. Disney would run for President in 1940 and despite all odds, he managed to win the nomination for President. He then proceeded to win the election for the Republicans. And though he has been labelled a dictator and an autocrat by his opposition, he has the full support of the government behind him and his plans for America, whatever that will bring."
POLITICS_CAL_NORTON_II_DESC:0"Emperor Norton II is a man who lived through many odd events, to ultimately become Emperor of an Empire that in all senses; shouldn't exist. Born Charles Ross Norton in 1881, he was the great nephew of a madman who declared himself Emperor of the United States, little did he know however that this event would lead to more madness within his own lifetime. For the majority of his life, Norton had lived a quiet, peaceful life in South Africa; even having a son by the name of Gerard Norton. Even after the Weltkrieg, nothing dramatically changed for him, his life was quiet and simple. \n\n That was until he was invited to a party in San Francisco on one fateful day. What started out as a gathering of 'Nortonites' led to him being swept up into the political upheaval and chaos plaguing the Pacific States at that time. Before he knew what was going on, he was being crowned Emperor Norton II in San Francisco, and after that; oddly enough came peace. Though he has attracted several loyal members and people who are willing to fight to the death for him, Norton is getting older with time. To many, he almost seems reluctant to the position of Emperor. But every morning he gets out of bed determined to at least do something about the problems he and his subjects face."

With the outbreak of the civil war, Walt pledged his full support for the Pacific Government and declared his intent for the Presidency. However, as the political scene changed; so did Disney. After Arnold’s intervention, Disney abandoned the Republican Party and along with Howard Hughes, formed the National Visionary Party. When Disney was elected, stability and prosperity was expected; however, the opposite came, and after the Nation begun to collapse, Disney had to take drastic measures. The democratic process is worthless, all it has done is send America on a downward spiral. Because of this, Disney has done away with the democratic forces that are hindering his Visionary plans. The so-called 'Visionary Party' has stacked the government with people loyal to Disney and his plans for America and instituted a dictatorship with Disney at its head. The voices of the opposition are now silent, the chaos has ended. And with his power base secured, Disney can begin his plans for the nation, whatever that will entail is up to Disney himself, who has the full support of the government. Many now believe that under President Disney's guidance America will not only prosper but it will rise to heights never seen before, but only time will tell if, and when such a thing will happen."

Forced to give up his chance at ruling America, and run out of his native land, Long has seen the worst of the world, and has mostly given up hope of returning home. The Bounty on his head is still over 10,000$, most citizens of his now-native Paraguay view him as an illegitimate foreigner; and he has been forced to learn the native tongue. In fact, he is no longer even referred to as “Huey Long”, but rather as Huey Largo, the translation of Long is Spanish.

During his younger years, Aiso was treated poorly by his peers due to the Anti-Japanese sentiment that was high in America at the time. Aiso attended Hollywood High School in the 20's where he gained national attention for his victory in the school's constitution oration contest, however he was not allowed to compete on the national level.

He attended the Lahne Military Institute, but advanced slowly in his officer's career, in part because he was abusive and violent toward his own men. He served in the Austro-Hungarian army as a cavalry captain during the Weltkrieg, but remained a mid-level officer. After the Weltkrieg, Prónay joined with many Hungarian Weltkrieg veterans in supporting far-right, nationalist politics. He was most influenced by the views of Gyula Gömbös, though he disagreed with his anti-Habsburg sentiments. That is, until the Emperor unveiled his plans for the national dismemberment of the Kingdom of Hungary, into a collection of minority states. Prónay now carries on the legacy of Gömbös and intends to implement his socio-economic system of 'National Socialism' throughout Hungary."

POLITICS_MATYAS_RAKOSI_DESC:0 "Rákosi was born in 1892 in Ada, a village in Bács-Bodrog County. In 1910, as a student, he joined the Hungarian Social Democratic Party (MSZDP) and was also a secretary and active member of the anarcho-syndicalist student movement, the Galilei Circle. He served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War and was captured on the Eastern Front in 1915 and held as a prisoner-of-war in Far Eastern POW camps by the Russians until the end of the war. During the chaos of the Bolshevik Revolution, he escaped bondage and joined the revolutionaries in Petrograd. Once Russia's revolution failed, he joined Kun's clique of Hungarian socialist revolutionaries. Unlike Kun, prone to violent temper and disliked by many party operatives, Rákosi seems able to 'work the system.' This is not to say he is any less violent or brutal than Kun, only that he knows when to pick his battles, and dispatches not merely his enemies, but his enemies' families as well."
POLITICS_ARPAD_SZAKASITS_DESC:0 "Leader of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party, Szakasits has always been considered dangerous by Hungarian conservatives and royalists because of his friendly attitude towards Syndicalists. Whether this is born of naivety or more sinister feelings is anyone's guess. Whatever the case, Szakasits is sure to make many changes to Hungary's stratified, religious society, as well as make appeals to the country's various minorities... a move sure to make him even less popular with the nation's Magyar majority."
POLITICS_MIHALY_KAROLYI_DESC:0 "The Károlyi family were an illustrious, extremely wealthy, Roman Catholic aristocratic family who had played an important role in Hungarian life since the 17th century. Mihály was born in Fót, Austria-Hungary. In his youth, he was a wastrel, but as he grew older, he became devoted to more serious pursuits. In 1909, he became the President of the OMGE (National Agricultural Society), the main rural organization of the nobility. Initially a supporter of the existing political and social system in Hungary, Károlyi gradually became more progressive and left-wing during his career. During the Weltkrieg, the pro-Entente Károlyi led a small but very active pacifist anti-war maverick fraction in the Hungarian parliament. For most, such a position would have meant political suicide after the war, but Károlyi has parleyed anti-Habsburg sentiment within Hungary, stoked by the Second Ausgleich of 1927, to take the reins of the pro-independence movement as leader of the Party of Independence."
POLITICS_ISTVAN_BETHLEN_DESC:0 "he scion of a noble Transylvanian family, Bethlen was elected to the Hungarian parliament as a Liberal in 1901. Bethlen steadily moved to the right during and after the Weltkrieg, in response to the excesses of the Socialist and Syndicalist revolutions of Russia and France, as well as the burgeoning social democratic party within Hungary. In 1936, he became one of the nation's most prominent politicians when he took control of the National Constitution Party, a conservative Hungarian political party opposed to the Second Ausgleich and continued Austrian interference, but not committed to the same radical social reforms promised by his rivals like Károlyi and Szakasits."
POLITICS_GYULA_KAROLYI_DESC:0 "He was born in Nyírbakta (now: Baktalórántháza) to an old aristocratic family. His parents were Count Tibor Károlyi, who served as Speaker of the House of Magnates from 1898 to 1900, and Countess Emma Degenfeld-Schomburg. Tibor Károlyi was also the guardian of Gyula's first cousin, Mihály Károlyi. Unlike his cousin, Gyula is a conservative politician, against radical social change and in favor of balanced budgets."
POLITICS_PAL_TELEKI_DESC:0 "Teleki was born to Géza Teleki (1844–1913), a Hungarian politician and Minister of the Interior, and his wife Irén Muráty (Muratisz) (1852–1941), the daughter of a wealthy Greek merchant, in Budapest, Hungary. Teleki attended the Royal Hungarian Academy of Economics and graduated with a PhD in 1903. He went on to become a university professor and expert on geography and socio-economic affairs in Hungary and a well-respected educator. He interrupted his career to volunteer for the Weltkrieg. After the war, Teleki Teleki was instrumental in supporting Scouting within Hungary. He became Hungary's Chief Scout, a member of the International Scout Committee, and Camp Chief of the 4th World Scout Jamboree held at The Royal Forest at Gödöllő. At the same time, Teleki entered into politics in earnest as a member of the Smallholder's Party. While not explicitly opposed to the Habsburg monarchy, Teleki believes above all in preserving Hungary's autonomy and national borders, as well as snuffing out any syndicalist revolutionary movements in the nation."

After the Kunist revolution, Teleki joined the counterrevolutionary government and became much more sympathetic to 'National Socialism' as well as explicitly anti-Habsburg. Now as Prime Minister of the nation, Teleki is focused on preserving Hungarian autonomy within the Great Game of Europe."
POLITICS_MIKLOS_KALLAY_DESC:0 "The Kállay family was old and influential among the local gentry of their region and Miklós served as lord lieutenant of his county from 1921-29. He then moved on to national government, serving first as deputy under secretary of state for the Ministry of Trade. He held high positions within the Emperor's government, prior to the nation's independence, but was not explicitly pro-Habsburg himself. While a conservative, he is fiercely opposed to the philosophy of 'National Socialism' promoted by Hungary's far-right, which he deems a form of soft syndicalism."
POLITICS_ISTVAN_FRIEDRICH_DESC:0 "A Hungarian footballer, factory owner, and politician of a family of German origin, Friedrich was born in Malacka in northern Hungary. Friedrich studied engineering at the University of Budapest and worked for AEG in Berlin until 1908, when he returned to Hungary. He joined Mihály Károlyi's Independence Party, and the two became close friends. Yet, Friedrich's idealism did not survive the Weltkrieg, and he eventually drifted away from the socially radical aspects of Károlyi's platform, while still supporting independence. Following independence, Friedrich chafed at Károlyi's reforms, and decided to challenge him for the premiership, lest Károlyi continue to lead Hungary down the wrong path."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_AUGUST_DESC:0 "Archduke Joseph August Viktor Klemens Maria of Austria was born at Alcsút in the Kingdom of Hungary on the 9th of August, 1872. He was highly decorated during the Weltkrieg, involved on both the Galician and Italian fronts. As Palatine of Hungary, he is a compromise between the royalists and the nationalists of the counterrevolutionary movement. Not the Emperor himself, but still a Habsburg and representative of the monarchy."
POLITICS_CARLOS_PIO_DESC:0 "Archduke Karl Pius of Austria, Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia, Prince of Tuscany... now Carlos VIII of Spain. For the first time in over two centuries, a Habsburg is once again King of Spain. Carlos VIII was born in Vienna, the youngest son of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria and of his wife Blanca de Borbón y de Borbón-Parma. His mother was the eldest daughter of Carlos, Duke of Madrid, Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain. Carlos VIII grew up in the Palais Toskana in Vienna, but moved to Barcelona at a young age. The youngest and furthest right of the Carlist claimants, Carlos VIII demonstrated his right-wing bona fides by joining a nationalist militia in Austria, participating in street fights against syndicalists from Vienna to Madrid. Now leader of the Carlists, Carlos VIII will restore Christ, Honor, and Tradition to Spain."
SCT_MACCORKMICK_DESC:0"A Lawyer, a Nationalist, and now the leader of a rebellion in Scotland. These are all positions held by John MacCormick, the man who hopes to free the Scottish Nation from English Tyranny. From an early age MacCormick was a fervent supporter of Scottish Home Rule, a position he would hold for the rest of his life. However, despite his oratory talents and large support base; Scottish Nationalism was suppressed by the more radical factions within the now Union of Britain; something exacerbated by his acceptance of more right-wing groups into his organization. Within time his organization was forced to go underground. This was the foundation of the modern Homeland Watch; an organization that was nothing but a fringe terror group at the time. But, as the Union of Britain disintegrated under Mosley’s totalitarian rule, the Homeland Watch took control over Scotland where the Brits had failed. And with the government crippled, MacCormick saw his chance to finally break the shackles that England has imposed on Scotland. The time was now, Scotland was to be free and there was no longer anyone to stop it."
POLITICS_SAUNDERS_LEWIS_DESC:0 "The life of Saunders Lewis would start relatively unremarkable. He served in France during the First World War, and after that would serve as a teacher who would conduct lectures in Welsh. Lewis had saw what had been achieved in Ireland, and with that was inspired along with many others to strive for the complete independence of Wales. And as the British Revolution came, the time to act against the Anglo oppressors was now. Lewis founded the "National Party of Wales", which’s had goals to make a fully Welsh-Speaking Wales; however, through the years found itself drawn into the storm of military conflict with the newly formed Union of Britain. This drew Lewis’ party underground and formed out of it the Welsh Home Rule Army, a terrorist organization dedicated to Welsh Independence. Normally it would have stayed as a mere terrorist group, but the collapse of the Union of Britain and the subsequent succession of Scotland lead to Wales too abandoning the Union of Britain. And with the UOB’s collapse, the WHRA rose up against the tyrannical forces of Mosley to help establish an independent Wales. However, they made peace with Y’ Glais’ socialist government to do so. But once the war ended, Lewis deposed Y’ Glais, and to pander to the international stage established a “Regency Council”. This however did not lead to a King being crowned, and after it’s disillusion Lewis became the unchallenged master of Wales. Its destiny is still unclear, but regardless one thing will persevere under Lewis’ Rule: Wales’ freedom"

POLITICS_HERB_DESC:0 "A former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and now the current President of the United States in exile, Herbert Hoover had solidified his position as one of the most hated men in American history. Despite only making the Great Depression worse during his first term, Hoover was reelected through the House of Representatives in 1932, causing widespread outrage. It's a sad reality for the President - any and all of his attempts for restoring the economy fail, his tries to calm the situation down only make it worse, and even his own party was turning away from him...\n\n That is all in the past now, however. America has fallen- no, America has been exiled, to Liberia. Destiny is a funny thing. Dread it, run from it, destiny arrives all the same. Hoover will restore the rightful America with his Legion of exiles. The American people will remember him as the greatest president in the country’s history."


POLITICS_FULTON_SHEEN_DESC:0 "Fulton John Sheen, Born in May 1895. Fulton made a name for himself with his teachings and being a well spoken preacher on the radio to catholic America. Although not as well known as Coughlin, this humble bishop had served as a servant to Catholics all across America with his teachings at the Catholic university and representation of them. This service and representation put him into the sight of Caroll who assigned him to his cabinet and had him continue to be the loyal preacher to the rapidly changing America. Now with the passing of Christ's regent Fulton Sheen has once again proven himself worthy in the eyes of the Holy American League who put their faith in him as Caroll’s successor. Sheen now has a lot of decisions on his plate, however keeping the spirit of Caroll’s America is his main goal, for blessed are the pure of heart."

POLITICS_CATHOLIC_SMITH_DESC:0 "Many politicians profess a desire for reform or pretend to crusade against corruption in all forms, but only a select few politicians both hold true to these promises while also becoming successful, efficient, and prominent while doing so. Archregent Al Smith is one such politician - a rare unsullied gem amid a sea of wolves and schemers. Born in 1873 in Manhattan to a working class Catholic Irish immigrants, Smith got a start into politics young by falling in with ‘Silent’ Charlie Murphy and the Tammany Hall group. It was in these young years that Smith solidified his reformist ideals and love for the working man - a foundation that would fuel his explosive career to new heights. Long dominating New York’s political stage as a member of the infamous Tammany Hall political machine that helped his rise and later as a leader the successful Efficiency Movement aimed at reforming the legislation that was leading his state to decay, Smith had become as famous nationwide for being one of the only successful Catholic politicians has he had been for his unending slew of successful legislation. Now, as Archregent, Smith has cast off the doubters who once whispered that the Pope would dictate his every whim, for no being or mantra guides Smith in his policy other than his dual faiths in good, honest governance and the Lord."

POLITICS_CATHOLIC_DAY_DESC:0 "Few have been able to balance a deep sense of socialist justice while still holding true to pure Christian principles as well as now-Archregent Dorothy Day. Born into a middle class Anglo-Irish family in Brooklyn in 1897, Day’s own religious awakening was brought on by her own reading, practice, and study; her parents being nominal Christians at best, driving Day to find God in her own way. After this Christianity-fueled interest consumed her childhood, Day spent her adolescence living the Bohemian dream, traveling across the nation as a journalist and vagabond, picking up new influences and ideas as she bounced from one Christian sect and Socialist ideology to another in her quest to find herself. After over a decade of soul-searching, as well as dealing with the trials of new motherhood, the American Civil War, and balancing her loyalties to her Socialist contacts in the IWW and her episcopal contacts in the former-Union State, Day has grown into one of the most unique and tempered political leaders in the Holy American League. Though many still distrust her Socialist sympathies, all true believers know Day’s love of Socialism comes not from a love of dusty, dated theory, but from seeing it as the loving, egalitarian will of the Lord himself. She shall be the prophet that shows America the light of true, non-bastardized Socialism - a Socialism bathed in God’s glory and tempered through piety."
