POLITICS_PAL_PRONAY_DESC:0 "Pál Prónay de Tótpróna et Blatnicza was born on November 2, 1874 in Romhány in the north of the Kingdom of Hungary. He attended the Lahne Military Institute, but advanced slowly in his officer's career, in part because he was abusive and violent toward his own men. He served in the Austro-Hungarian army as a cavalry captain during the Weltkrieg, but remained a mid-level officer. After the Weltkrieg, Prónay joined with many Hungarian Weltkrieg veterans in supporting far-right, nationalist politics. He was most influenced by the views of Gyula Gömbös, though he disagreed with his anti-Habsburg sentiments. That is, until the Emperor unveiled his plans for the national dismemberment of the Kingdom of Hungary, into a collection of minority states. Prónay now carries on the legacy of Gömbös and intends to implement his socio-economic system of 'National Socialism' throughout Hungary."
POLITICS_ANTON_LEHAR_DESC:0 "Lehár was born in Sopron, Austria-Hungary, as the younger son of a bandmaster in the Infantry Regiment No. 50 of the Austro-Hungarian Army. His elder brother, Franz Lehár, went on to become a celebrated composer, but Anton chose the military life. He entered cadet school in Vienna to become a professional officer, finishing at the top of his class in 1893. Prior to the outbreak of war, Lehár joined the general staff and served as a musketry instructor, where his skill was honored even by foreign governments in Romania and Turkey. Lehár's leadership and valor during the Weltkrieg saw him severely wounded and rewarded with the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa, ennobling him with the title 'Freiherr von.' Despite his wounds and value as a training officer, he repeatedly requested assignments to the front to command men in battle. After the Weltkrieg, Lehár continued to serve His Apostolic Majesty in the Royal Hungarian Honvéd."
POLITICS_HUN_MOVE_DESC:0 "MOVE (Hungarian National Defense League) grew out of the 'right radicals' phenomenon - those who strongly opposed the Hungarian Soviet Republic but who felt that the mainstream conservatives were not strong enough to cope with the shift to communism. Made up of royalists, reactionaries, and 'national socialists' influenced by the late Gyula Gömbös, MOVE is a loosely organized paramilitary organization made up of the veterans and rebellious army divisions who deposed the Kunist regime in Budapest."
POLITICS_BELA_KUN_DESC:0 "Béla Kohn, later known as Béla Kun, was born on 20 February 1886 in the village of Lele, located near Szilágycseh, Transylvania. Before the Weltkrieg, he was a muck-raking journalist with sympathies for the Hungarian Social Democratic Party in Kolozsvár. In addition, Kun served on the Kolozsvár Social Insurance Board (and was later accused of embezzling board funds). He had a fiery reputation and was involved in several duels. Kun fought in the Weltkrieg for Austria-Hungary, but was captured by the Russians. It was during this time that he became interested in communism. Ultimately, he became a supporter of the failed Bolshevik revolution, and became a permanent exile after the victorious Germans put a stop to Bolshevism. However, this did not stop Kun from founding the Hungarian Communist Party with his fellow Hungarian exiles, Mátyás Rákosi and Tibor Szamuely. When the Commune was born in Paris, Kun found asylum in France, where he continued to plot Hungary's revolution."
POLITICS_MATYAS_RAKOSI_DESC:0 "Rákosi was born in 1892 in Ada, a village in Bács-Bodrog County. In 1910, as a student, he joined the Hungarian Social Democratic Party (MSZDP) and was also a secretary and active member of the anarcho-syndicalist student movement, the Galilei Circle. He served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War and was captured on the Eastern Front in 1915 and held as a prisoner-of-war in Far Eastern POW camps by the Russians until the end of the war. During the chaos of the Bolshevik Revolution, he escaped bondage and joined the revolutionaries in Petrograd. Once Russia's revolution failed, he joined Kun's clique of Hungarian socialist revolutionaries. Unlike Kun, prone to violent temper and disliked by many party operatives, Rákosi seems able to 'work the system.' This is not to say he is any less violent or brutal than Kun, only that he knows when to pick his battles, and dispatches not merely his enemies, but his enemies' families as well."
POLITICS_ARPAD_SZAKASITS_DESC:0 "Leader of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party, Szakasits has always been considered dangerous by Hungarian conservatives and royalists because of his friendly attitude towards Syndicalists. Whether this is born of naivety or more sinister feelings is anyone's guess. Whatever the case, Szakasits is sure to make many changes to Hungary's stratified, religious society, as well as make appeals to the country's various minorities... a move sure to make him even less popular with the nation's Magyar majority."
POLITICS_MIHALY_KAROLYI_DESC:0 "The Károlyi family were an illustrious, extremely wealthy, Roman Catholic aristocratic family who had played an important role in Hungarian life since the 17th century. Mihály was born in Fót, Austria-Hungary. In his youth, he was a wastrel, but as he grew older, he became devoted to more serious pursuits. In 1909, he became the President of the OMGE (National Agricultural Society), the main rural organization of the nobility. Initially a supporter of the existing political and social system in Hungary, Károlyi gradually became more progressive and left-wing during his career. During the Weltkrieg, the pro-Entente Károlyi led a small but very active pacifist anti-war maverick fraction in the Hungarian parliament. For most, such a position would have meant political suicide after the war, but Károlyi has parleyed anti-Habsburg sentiment within Hungary, stoked by the Second Ausgleich of 1927, to take the reins of the pro-independence movement as leader of the Party of Independence."
POLITICS_ISTVAN_BETHLEN_DESC:0 "he scion of a noble Transylvanian family, Bethlen was elected to the Hungarian parliament as a Liberal in 1901. Bethlen steadily moved to the right during and after the Weltkrieg, in response to the excesses of the Socialist and Syndicalist revolutions of Russia and France, as well as the burgeoning social democratic party within Hungary. In 1936, he became one of the nation's most prominent politicians when he took control of the National Constitution Party, a conservative Hungarian political party opposed to the Second Ausgleich and continued Austrian interference, but not committed to the same radical social reforms promised by his rivals like Károlyi and Szakasits."
POLITICS_GYULA_KAROLYI_DESC:0 "He was born in Nyírbakta (now: Baktalórántháza) to an old aristocratic family. His parents were Count Tibor Károlyi, who served as Speaker of the House of Magnates from 1898 to 1900, and Countess Emma Degenfeld-Schomburg. Tibor Károlyi was also the guardian of Gyula's first cousin, Mihály Károlyi. Unlike his cousin, Gyula is a conservative politician, against radical social change and in favor of balanced budgets."
POLITICS_PAL_TELEKI_DESC:0 "Teleki was born to Géza Teleki (1844–1913), a Hungarian politician and Minister of the Interior, and his wife Irén Muráty (Muratisz) (1852–1941), the daughter of a wealthy Greek merchant, in Budapest, Hungary. Teleki attended the Royal Hungarian Academy of Economics and graduated with a PhD in 1903. He went on to become a university professor and expert on geography and socio-economic affairs in Hungary and a well-respected educator. He interrupted his career to volunteer for the Weltkrieg. After the war, Teleki Teleki was instrumental in supporting Scouting within Hungary. He became Hungary's Chief Scout, a member of the International Scout Committee, and Camp Chief of the 4th World Scout Jamboree held at The Royal Forest at Gödöllő. At the same time, Teleki entered into politics in earnest as a member of the Smallholder's Party. While not explicitly opposed to the Habsburg monarchy, Teleki believes above all in preserving Hungary's autonomy and national borders, as well as snuffing out any syndicalist revolutionary movements in the nation."
POLITICS_PAL_TELEKI_NP_DESC:0 "Teleki was born to Géza Teleki (1844–1913), a Hungarian politician and Minister of the Interior, and his wife Irén Muráty (Muratisz) (1852–1941), the daughter of a wealthy Greek merchant, in Budapest, Hungary.

At the same time, Teleki entered into politics in earnest as a member of the Smallholder's Party. After the Kunist revolution, Teleki joined the counterrevolutionary government and became much more sympathetic to 'National Socialism' as well as explicitly anti-Habsburg. Now as Prime Minister of the nation, Teleki is focused on preserving Hungarian autonomy within the Great Game of Europe."
POLITICS_MIKLOS_KALLAY_DESC:0 "The Kállay family was old and influential among the local gentry of their region and Miklós served as lord lieutenant of his county from 1921-29. He then moved on to national government, serving first as deputy under secretary of state for the Ministry of Trade. He held high positions within the Emperor's government, prior to the nation's independence, but was not explicitly pro-Habsburg himself. While a conservative, he is fiercely opposed to the philosophy of 'National Socialism' promoted by Hungary's far-right, which he deems a form of soft syndicalism."
POLITICS_ISTVAN_FRIEDRICH_DESC:0 "A Hungarian footballer, factory owner, and politician of a family of German origin, Friedrich was born in Malacka in northern Hungary. Friedrich studied engineering at the University of Budapest and worked for AEG in Berlin until 1908, when he returned to Hungary. He joined Mihály Károlyi's Independence Party, and the two became close friends. Yet, Friedrich's idealism did not survive the Weltkrieg, and he eventually drifted away from the socially radical aspects of Károlyi's platform, while still supporting independence. Following independence, Friedrich chafed at Károlyi's reforms, and decided to challenge him for the premiership, lest Károlyi continue to lead Hungary down the wrong path."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_AUGUST_DESC:0 "Archduke Joseph August Viktor Klemens Maria of Austria was born at Alcsút in the Kingdom of Hungary on the 9th of August, 1872. He was highly decorated during the Weltkrieg, involved on both the Galician and Italian fronts. As Palatine of Hungary, he is a compromise between the royalists and the nationalists of the counterrevolutionary movement. Not the Emperor himself, but still a Habsburg and representative of the monarchy."
POLITICS_CARLOS_PIO_DESC:0 "Archduke Karl Pius of Austria, Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia, Prince of Tuscany... now Carlos VIII of Spain. For the first time in over two centuries, a Habsburg is once again King of Spain. Carlos VIII was born in Vienna, the youngest son of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria and of his wife Blanca de Borbón y de Borbón-Parma. His mother was the eldest daughter of Carlos, Duke of Madrid, Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain. Carlos VIII grew up in the Palais Toskana in Vienna, but moved to Barcelona at a young age. The youngest and furthest right of the Carlist claimants, Carlos VIII demonstrated his right-wing bona fides by joining a nationalist militia in Austria, participating in street fights against syndicalists from Vienna to Madrid. Now leader of the Carlists, Carlos VIII will restore Christ, Honor, and Tradition to Spain."
SCT_MACCORKMICK_DESC:0"A Lawyer, a Nationalist, and now the leader of a rebellion in Scotland. These are all positions held by John MacCormick, the man who hopes to free the Scottish Nation from English Tyranny. From an early age MacCormick was a fervent supporter of Scottish Home Rule, a position he would hold for the rest of his life. However, despite his oratory talents and large support base; Scottish Nationalism was suppressed by the more radical factions within the now Union of Britain; something exacerbated by his acceptance of more right-wing groups into his organization. Within time his organization was forced to go underground. This was the foundation of the modern Homeland Watch; an organization that was nothing but a fringe terror group at the time. But, as the Union of Britain disintegrated under Mosley’s totalitarian rule, the Homeland Watch took control over Scotland where the Brits had failed. And with the government crippled, MacCormick saw his chance to finally break the shackles that England has imposed on Scotland. The time was now, Scotland was to be free and there was no longer anyone to stop it."
POLITICS_SAUNDERS_LEWIS_DESC:0 "The life of Saunders Lewis would start relatively unremarkable. He served in France during the First World War, and after that would serve as a teacher who would conduct lectures in Welsh. Lewis had saw what had been achieved in Ireland, and with that was inspired along with many others to strive for the complete independence of Wales. And as the British Revolution came, the time to act against the Anglo oppressors was now. Lewis founded the "National Party of Wales", which’s had goals to make a fully Welsh-Speaking Wales; however, through the years found itself drawn into the storm of military conflict with the newly formed Union of Britain. This drew Lewis’ party underground and formed out of it the Welsh Home Rule Army, a terrorist organization dedicated to Welsh Independence. Normally it would have stayed as a mere terrorist group, but the collapse of the Union of Britain and the subsequent succession of Scotland lead to Wales too abandoning the Union of Britain. And with the UOB’s collapse, the WHRA rose up against the tyrannical forces of Mosley to help establish an independent Wales. However, they made peace with Y’ Glais’ socialist government to do so. But once the war ended, Lewis deposed Y’ Glais, and to pander to the international stage established a “Regency Council”. This however did not lead to a King being crowned, and after it’s disillusion Lewis became the unchallenged master of Wales. Its destiny is still unclear, but regardless one thing will persevere under Lewis’ Rule: Wales’ freedom"

POLITICS_HERB_DESC:0 "A former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and now the current President of the United States in exile, Herbert Hoover had solidified his position as one of the most hated men in American history. Despite only making the Great Depression worse during his first term, Hoover was reelected through the House of Representatives in 1932, causing widespread outrage. It's a sad reality for the President - any and all of his attempts for restoring the economy fail, his tries to calm the situation down only make it worse, and even his own party was turning away from him...\n\n That is all in the past now, however. America has fallen- no, America has been exiled, to Liberia. Destiny is a funny thing. Dread it, run from it, destiny arrives all the same. Hoover will restore the rightful America with his Legion of exiles. The American people will remember him as the greatest president in the country’s history."


POLITICS_FULTON_SHEEN_DESC:0 "Fulton John Sheen, Born in May 1895. Fulton made a name for himself with his teachings and being a well spoken preacher on the radio to catholic America. Although not as well known as Coughlin, this humble bishop had served as a servant to Catholics all across America with his teachings at the Catholic university and representation of them. This service and representation put him into the sight of Caroll who assigned him to his cabinet and had him continue to be the loyal preacher to the rapidly changing America. Now with the passing of Christ's regent Fulton Sheen has once again proven himself worthy in the eyes of the Holy American League who put their faith in him as Caroll’s successor. Sheen now has a lot of decisions on his plate, however keeping the spirit of Caroll’s America is his main goal, for blessed are the pure of heart."

POLITICS_CATHOLIC_SMITH_DESC:0 "Many politicians profess a desire for reform or pretend to crusade against corruption in all forms, but only a select few politicians both hold true to these promises while also becoming successful, efficient, and prominent while doing so. Archregent Al Smith is one such politician - a rare unsullied gem amid a sea of wolves and schemers. Born in 1873 in Manhattan to a working class Catholic Irish immigrants, Smith got a start into politics young by falling in with ‘Silent’ Charlie Murphy and the Tammany Hall group. It was in these young years that Smith solidified his reformist ideals and love for the working man - a foundation that would fuel his explosive career to new heights. Long dominating New York’s political stage as a member of the infamous Tammany Hall political machine that helped his rise and later as a leader the successful Efficiency Movement aimed at reforming the legislation that was leading his state to decay, Smith had become as famous nationwide for being one of the only successful Catholic politicians has he had been for his unending slew of successful legislation. Now, as Archregent, Smith has cast off the doubters who once whispered that the Pope would dictate his every whim, for no being or mantra guides Smith in his policy other than his dual faiths in good, honest governance and the Lord."

POLITICS_CATHOLIC_DAY_DESC:0 "Few have been able to balance a deep sense of socialist justice while still holding true to pure Christian principles as well as now-Archregent Dorothy Day. Born into a middle class Anglo-Irish family in Brooklyn in 1897, Day’s own religious awakening was brought on by her own reading, practice, and study; her parents being nominal Christians at best, driving Day to find God in her own way. After this Christianity-fueled interest consumed her childhood, Day spent her adolescence living the Bohemian dream, traveling across the nation as a journalist and vagabond, picking up new influences and ideas as she bounced from one Christian sect and Socialist ideology to another in her quest to find herself. After over a decade of soul-searching, as well as dealing with the trials of new motherhood, the American Civil War, and balancing her loyalties to her Socialist contacts in the IWW and her episcopal contacts in the former-Union State, Day has grown into one of the most unique and tempered political leaders in the Holy American League. Though many still distrust her Socialist sympathies, all true believers know Day’s love of Socialism comes not from a love of dusty, dated theory, but from seeing it as the loving, egalitarian will of the Lord himself. She shall be the prophet that shows America the light of true, non-bastardized Socialism - a Socialism bathed in God’s glory and tempered through piety."
