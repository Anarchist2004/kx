### Ideas ###
WSU_Polish_Landowners:0 "Szlachta Dominance"
WSU_Polish_Landowners_desc:0 "For decades the Polish Nobility has land in ownership in ethnically Ukrainian lands of Eastern Galicia. Without any real solution to the land issue yet, the Ukrainian peasants feel oppressed and powerless."
WSU_Underindustrialized_Region:0 "Rural Society"
WSU_Underindustrialized_Region_desc:0 "Galicia-Lodomeria stood as one of the poorest regions in Europe, with industry barely developed here. While we can say that we are a rural society, this does not get along with our plans for liberation of the Ukrainians."
WSU_Poor_Administration:0 "Administrative Mismanagement"
WSU_Poor_Administration_desc:0 "Before the uprising, Polish and Ukrainian elites were fighting for every office, and Ukrainians were loosing this governmental war. Without control of the most important political structures, Ukrainians don't have a clear leverage."
WSU_Multiethnic_Tensions:0 "The Carpathian Powderkeg"
WSU_Multiethnic_Tensions_desc:0 "Eastern Galicia is inhabited by various ethnic groups whose relations between each other... are tense at best. Poles, Romanians, Ukrainians, Hungarians, Slovaks are fighting for influence, power and representation, and thank God that this has not turned into open confrontation, at least for now..."

### Starting Focuses ###
WSU_Ukraine_Is_Not_Yet_Lost:0 "Ukraine Is Not Yet Lost!"
WSU_Ukraine_Is_Not_Yet_Lost_desc:0 "In the chaos of war in Galicia-Lodomeria, the Ukrainian officials have proclaimed the independence of the 'Ukrainian lands of the Austrian Empire', commonly known as the West Ukraine.

WSU_Battle_For_Lviv_desc:0 "Lemberg, or Lviv, or Lwów, was the former capital of the Galicia-Lodomeria. The ethnic situation in Lviv is tough, since the Ukrainians are a minority in this region. The Poles already start mobilizing, and if we loose Lviv, our independence will be on the brink."
WSU_Mobilize_UGA:0 "Mobilize the UGA"
WSU_Mobilize_UGA_desc:0 "The Ukrainian Galician Army was formed after the Weltkrieg as national voluntary force of the Galicia-Lodomeria, a direct successor of the Ukrainian Sichovi Striltsi legion. The creation of the UGA was a part of the autonomisation of the Empire and, thanks to the Vienna officials, the Ukrainians had their own defensive forces. However, the times have changed and now we need the help of the UGA to fight against our former masters."

### Events ###
wsu.1.t:0 "West Ukraine Secedes!"
wsu.1.d:0 "As soon as active hostilities began in Galicia, in its eastern part, Ukrainians began to consolidate forces for the declaration of independence of the Ukrainian lands and their further reunification with Kyiv. It began with popular uprisings, which soon turned into violent clashes between Ukrainians and Poles. The Ukrainian Galician Army intervened, stopping the unrest and arresting the instigators, but at the same time a long deputy of the Austrian Parliament and the Galician Sojm, Yevhen Petrushevych, announced the creation of an independent Ukrainian state, began creating responsible bodies and mobilizing in the rebel army. The situation is clearly not in our favor."
wsu.1.a:0 "Ukraine is not yet lost! (Play as West Ukraine)"
wsu.1.b:0 "How dare they!"

wsu.2.t:0 "Clashes Between Poles and Ukrainians"
wsu.2.d:0 "People's marches and rallies of pro-independence Ukrainians began in eastern Galicia. In large Ukrainian cities like Tarnopol and Stanislaviv, they have reached fairly large proportions, but the situation is worst in predominantly Polish Lviv, where local Polish nationalists have already confronted the protesters. The situation is escalating by the day..."
wsu.2.a:0 "Situation is getting out of our control!"

wsu.3.t:0 "Polish Resistance in Lviv"
wsu.3.d:0 "The Polish majority in Lviv has engaged in open confrontation with us. The Poles are arming themselves and preparing to defend the city, from which our troops have been forced to temporarily retreat. If we fail to retake Lviv, the road to Kyiv will be closed to us."
wsu.3.a:0 "Get ready for the siege of Lviv!"

wsu.4.t:0 "The Lands of Eastern Galicia in 1936"
wsu.4.d:0 "As a result of the First Partition of Poland, Eastern Galicia, inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians, was annexed to the Austrian Empire and became part of the Kingdom of Galicia-Lodomeria. By 1936, the kingdom was granted fairly broad autonomy, which did not save the situation of ethnic Ukrainians in these lands. Torn apart by ethnic strife and widespread poverty, Galicia could barely cope.\nDespite Vienna's initial support for the Ukrainian national movement, this turned out to be very much part of the political confrontation with Russia. As soon as the Hetmanate was consolidated in Kiev, and later the Austrian king was put on the throne, the question of Eastern Galicia seemed to be forgotten and put on the back burner. No action was taken to create a national autonomy of Ukrainians separate from Western Galicia, and the talk was idle talk. However, the Ukrainian Galician Army was created from the volunteer legion of Ukrainian Secherdsmen who had remained in Western Ukraine, though in direct subordination to the Austro-Hungarian commander-in-chief. \nBy now, the self-proclaimed state of the Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia rests on the bayonets of the Galician Army and the authority of Eugene Petrushevsky, a fighter for the autonomy of Eastern Galicia and a popular Western Ukrainian politician."
wsu.4.a:0 "Ukraine is not yet lost!"

wsu.5.t:0 "Convocation of the UNRada"
wsu.5.d:0 "By decision of the national representative assembly, the Ukrainian National Rada of the West Ukrainian regions of Austria-Hungary was established and convened. \n\nThe assembly was composed of all Ukrainian deputies of both Austrian chambers, regional sejms of Galicia and Bukovina, representatives of the episcopate, in addition to a number of prominent non-party professionals, representatives of youth elected from the cities. Petrushevich, the most authoritative person in Western Ukraine at the moment, was appointed Chairman of the Rada.\n\nFor now, without the possibility of sitting in Lviv, the Rada plans to continue to meet in Tarnopol, but the most important issues, including the foreign policy situation, namely the fate of the Western Ukrainian lands as part of Austria, must already be decided.\n\nSome deputies are inclined to reach an agreement with representatives of Austria on broad autonomy, while others demand full independence from Austrian rule, which has not justified itself. All of these issues have yet to be resolved, but the main one is the land issue in connection with the domination of the Polish nobility and the liberation of Lvov."
wsu.5.a:0 "Hopefully we will endure..."
