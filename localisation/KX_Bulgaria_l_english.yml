BUL_end_german_trade_war: "End the German-Bulgarian Trade War"
BUL_end_german_trade_war_desc: "Prime Minister Malinov’s decision to break off all ties with Germany had disastrous consequences for our possibilities in choosing trade partners. With both of our economies being hit by the Black Monday, perhaps it’s time to end the ongoing trade war and cooperate once again."

BUL_reorganize_veteran_payments: "Reorganize Veteran Pensions"
BUL_reorganize_veteran_payments_desc: "The current system of veteran pensions is simply unsustainable. Recognizing this, our government proposed to minimize them and spread them out more in time.

BUL_rifles_for_civilians_desc: "While it’s correct that the civilian industry is important, we can’t forget that the war is coming.

bul.8.b: "Install a military and government entirely comprised of Bulgarians"

kxbul.1.t: "Schools flourishing"
kxbul.1.d: "The sponsorship of education we have been delegating out to schools has at last showed some result - schools of Bulgaria are doing much, much better than they ever have. And, obviously, history is one of the favorite subjects in polls conducted in the flourishing schools."
kxbul.1.a: "Good to hear!"



kxbul.3.t: "Status of Volga Bulgaria"
kxbul.3.d: "Volga Bulgaria has loyally been with us for a year now, so it's time we make the decision of their fate: will they join the Khanate or shall they keep their statehood?"
kxbul.3.a: "Come to the Khan!"

kxbul.4.a: "Implement the use of the drug."
kxbul.4.b: "This might give us more attention than we need."

kxbul.5.t: "The Bulgars Anew"
kxbul.5.d: "With the Bulgars re-established as a culture and people, it is only logical we take what's ours. The Volga will run red with the blood of the Russians - then it shall be washed over by the beautiful blue everyone knows. And thus with the bleeding Volga shall the world know that we are indeed what we say we are."
kxbul.5.a: "And reclaim our legacy we shall!"

kxbul.6.t: "The Successor"
kxbul.6.d: "The old leader of Bulgaria is dead, and all sources point towards the newest leader being influential Tatar activist Gajaz Ishaki. An unseen charm and his rhetoric have propelled him to the forefront of Bulgarian politics. He is making his inauguration within the next few hours."
kxbul.6.a: "Good luck!"

kxbul.7.t: "Tatar Immigrants"
kxbul.7.d: "The Tatars in Russia and Asia have been flocking to Bulgaria lately. Most of these people happen to be Volga Bulgarians. No one knows exactly why people are coming here, but the people who do end up in Bulgaria say that the situation was no longer able to be salvaged in their home country, which to us seems a little strange, but it's the only reason we will ever get."
kxbul.7.a: "Interesting."

kxbul.8.t: "A Tatar Proposition"
kxbul.8.d: "The Tatars of Bulgaria wish for us to donate to their brethren who did not embark on the journey to Bulgaria, and fund their movements and people - along with small pensions to those who did immigrate to Bulgaria. There is very little anti-Tatar sentiment arising in Bulgaria, so it could be worth a shot."
kxbul.8.a: "We could make some donations, I guess."
kxbul.8.b: "How frivolous!"

kxbul.9.t: "More Tatar Immigrants"
kxbul.9.d: "Another spike has appeared in our demographics, where even more people of Tatar descent have arrived to our nation.

kxbul.9.a: "Wow."

kxbul.10.t: "Gajaz Ishaki Wins Seat in Parliament"
kxbul.10.d: "A person of Volga Bulgarian Tatar descent, known as Gajas Ishaki, a Bulgarist, as he calls himself, has been elected into the Bulgarian Parliament. He arrived to Bulgaria on the first wave of Tatar immigrants, where he quickly got himself working on building a political career in record time."
kxbul.10.a: "A Tatar in Parliament?"

kxbul.11.t: "Rising Tatar sympathy in the government"
kxbul.11.d: "The whispers in Parliament that do end up getting intercepted by other ears speak of the Tatars. And not of how bad they are, but of how the Tatar situation is poor and how we should seek to better it, especially the Volga Tatars. It seems that Gajaz Ishaki has been preaching to our Parliament unnoticed..."
kxbul.11.a: "Must be the work of Ishaki."

kxbul.13.t: "[BUL.GetLeader]'s popularity polling lower"
kxbul.13.d: "In a recent wave of polls and questionnaires about the government, it appears that [BUL>GetLeader]'s popularity is trending way, way lower than usual. Now a highly unpopular candidate to lead the nation, this would explain the small protests an gatherings in the nation. Some members of Parliament have pressured [BUL.GetLeader] to resign, meanwhile."
kxbul.13.a: "I think we should resign..."
kxbul.13.b: "Keep going."

kxbul.14.t: "Opposition Exterminated"
kxbul.14.d: "More polls have arrived detailing the elimination of all opposing parties - Parliament is now entirely controlled by Ishaki and there is no one who would object to him taking total control. And that's just what Ishaki plans on doing, kicking everyone else off the boat and having full control over it himself..."
kxbul.14.a: "It is time."

kxbul.15.t: "Assassination attempt on Ishaki!"
kxbul.15.d: "Our new benevolent dictator Gajaz Ishaki, while giving a speech to the masses, was shot! In the head, no less!\nDoctors, however, expect him to make a full recovery, but people around him say he doesn't seem right in the head. Maybe that medical miracle wasn't so much of a miracle..?"
kxbul.15.a: "Ishaki doesn't seem right in the head anymore."

kxbul.20.t: "Riots!"
kxbul.20.d: "The radical shift in leadership has resulted in a flurry of rioting across the nation. Buildings burn, people fight, and the economy dives. Ishaki has considered sending in the army before, but now there is no better choice..."
kxbul.20.a: "Shut it down."

kxbul.21.t: "Horrors of our Incendiary Weaponry"
kxbul.21.d: "Our incendiary weaponry has been tested on targets, only for an effect much more devastating that what we originally expected. Incinerating everything in sight, hellifying the land, our new weapons will bring nothing but terror for the enemy on the battlefield."
kxbul.21.a: "Well, at least they work."

kxbul.22.t: "The Khan"
kxbul.22.d: "Khan Gayaz Ishaki has been crowned at last! As the leader of the Bulgar Khanate, he seeks to restore the Bulgars to the glory they held so long ago, and bring them on a permanent visit to the Volga - where another Bulgaria will rise from the grave of the previous inhabitant."
kxbul.22.a: "Hail to thee!"
