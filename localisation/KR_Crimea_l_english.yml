crm.1.t:0 "Modern Crimean History"
crm.1.d:0 "The Crimean Peninsula has been a fusion of many cultures and nationalities since ancient times, including Greeks, Romans, Khazars, Polovtsians, Genoese, and finally, Russians, Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars.\n\nThe modern history of Crimea begins in 1917, when, in the wake of revolutionary events in Russia, the first Turkic republic, the Crimean People's Republic, appeared on the fragments of a once great empire. The elected Kurultai of the Crimean Tatars proclaimed the independence of the Crimean state, but soon after that the island was conquered by Bolshevik-minded forces who were able to hold power for only a few months. Nevertheless, during these few months, a terrible red terror broke out in Crimea, which claimed the lives of many people.\n\nIn June 1918, the peninsula was occupied by the Kaiser's troops and power passed to the pro-German Crimean Regional Government under the leadership of Suleiman Sulkevich. All government activities were under the full control of the occupation command. In July 1918, a government delegation visited Berlin in order to achieve recognition by the German government of the independence of Crimea from Ukraine, to receive loans from it and establish trade relations with Germany. Behind the scenes, the German government was also offered a memorandum by the Crimean Tatar Directory on the creation of the Crimean Khanate under the patronage of Germany and Turkey. However, these proposals did not receive support in Berlin.\n\nCrimea's relations with the Skoropadsky government initially did not work out. In September - October, the Crimean-Ukrainian negotiations were held in Kiev, at which the Ukrainian delegation proposed that Crimea become part of Ukraine on the rights of extremely broad autonomy. The Crimean delegation made a counter-proposal: the creation of a federal union. Unfortunately, it was not possible to come to an agreement, and as a result, by the end of the year, Crimea became fully part of Hetman Ukraine. Sulkevich's government resigned, and the new one under the leadership of Solomon Krym announced the creation of the government of the Crimean Republic in exile. Despite the presence of occupation troops, anarchist and Bolshevik forces continued sabotage and terror, until the end of the war, when the territory of the whole of Ukraine was completely liberated from all red scum.\n\nThus, since 1919, Crimea has been under the full authority of the Hetmanate, and despite a small autonomy for the local population, it underwent Ukrainization in the 1920s. Now that Hetman Ukraine is in a protracted crisis, the government in exile has returned to give the peoples inhabiting Crimea their legitimate territories."
crm.1.a:0 "Ant Etkenmen!"

crm.2.t:0 "The Divided Peninsula"
crm.2.d:0 "Crimea is inhabited by various peoples, but in general, the 4 most numerous stand out: Russians, who make up about 40% of the population, Ukrainians, who make up about 30%, Crimean Tatars, who make up about 20%, as well as Crimeans, Karaites and others.\n\nNow the government of Solomon Krym, which has supreme authority over the peninsula, in fact represents only 20% of the population, while the Russian majority, the Ukrainian and Jewish minorities are alienated from the governance of the state. Despite the fact that the Government declares the freedom of expression of the will of the people immediately after the acquisition of sovereignty by the peninsula, their true intentions are questioned.\n\nRussian Russian majority, at the same time, is in some political isolation, as it does not border with Russia either by land or by sea, and is surrounded either by the water or by anti-Russian-minded countries. In addition, there is no significant political organization in Crimea that defends the rights of Russians.\n\nHowever, the Karaite minority stands out in particular - the Turkic population, which professes one of the currents of Judaism. The leader of their community is Gahan Seraya Shapshal, known for his eccentric statements and unhealthy interest in the history of the Khazar Khaganate."
crm.2.a:0 "Interesting"

crm.3.t:0 "Local Insurgency in the Crimea!"
crm.3.d:0 "Local clashes with the Hetman's army, as well as protests against the King and the Hetman, began among the local population in Crimea, mainly Crimean Tatars. Minorities who are dissatisfied with the agricultural crisis, inflation and, in general, our policy demand bread, lower taxes and higher wages. Despite the fact that our economy cannot afford extra expenses now, we can try to avoid further conflict and reduce taxes for Crimeans and hope that this will calm the population."
crm.3.a:0 "Suppress the insurgency!"
crm.3.b:0 "Ease the tax burden for Crimeans."

crm.4.t:0 "Solomon Krym Returns to the Crimea"
crm.4.d:0 "We have received information that Solomon Krym, the so-called leader of the "government of the Crimean People's Republic in exile" illegally crossed the border with our country and somehow penetrated into Crimea, probably from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nSolomon Krym was one of the leaders of the Crimean Tatar national movement, being in opposition to the first Crimean regional government of Sulkevich. Before the Civil War, he headed an agricultural society in the Crimea and did a lot for the development of horticulture and viticulture of the region. He participated in many charitable foundations, founded scholarships, financed the activities of the Karadag scientific Station, archaeological excavations on the peninsula and publishing activities.\n\nAfter Sulkevich's Crimean republic was absorbed by Ukraine, Solomon Crimea declared himself the new prime minister and founded a government in exile, remaining its undisputed leader all these years. Now he's in Crimea, and we should probably expect separatist unrest on the peninsula."
crm.4.a:0 "We must find him before he could rally people"

crm.5.t:0 "Separatism in Crimea"
crm.5.d:0 "As expected, upon arriving on the peninsula, Solomon Crimea began actively promoting separatism and the national independence of the Crimean Tatars. His speech in Bakhchisarai gathered a large rally, and many began to arm themselves against our government, seizing towns and villages.\n\nIt is urgently necessary to restore order in the region, but for this it is proposed to introduce martial law in the entire Tauride District, as well as prepare the Black Sea Fleet either for evacuation or for the suppression of a separatist uprising.\n\nOleksandr Rogoza, an outstanding Ukrainian military commander, was appointed temporary governor of the Tauride district and responsible for suppressing the Crimean uprising."
crm.5.a:0 "Send our best general to deal with crisis."

crm.6.t:0 "Tavria Okruha"
crm.6.d:0 "So, a curfew and martial law were imposed throughout the Tauride district, Oleksandr Rogoza arrived in the district with an armed division in order to suppress the uprising.\n\nBy this time, the militias were able to establish control over almost the entire peninsula, with the exception of some individual parts with a Ukrainian majority and Sevastopol.\n\nGeneral Rogoza will have to seize the Isthmus of Perekop and, with the help of the Black Sea Fleet, regain control of the peninsula, arrest Solomon Krym and suppress the separatist uprising."
crm.6.a:0 "Oleksandr Rogoza will deal with the insurgency."
crm.6.b:0 "The separatism should be destroyed! (Play as Tavria Okruha)"
crm.6.c:0 "Down with Ukrainians! (Play as Independent Crimea)"

crm.7.t:0 "Perekop Shaft"
crm.7.d:0 "We need to gain a foothold on the Perekop Isthmus and successfully counterattack General Rogoza's divisions. While we have some time to prepare, we can strengthen the ancient Perekopsky rampart - a defensive structure consisting of a deep moat in order to gain a firm foothold on the peninsula and switch attention to Sevastopol, hoping to seize control of the city - and, first of all, over the fleet.\n\nOn the other hand, we can abandon attempts to reconstruct the ancient rampart and switch all the main attention to Sevastopol, leaving a small garrison on the isthmus, which can easily repel the attacks of the Ukrainian army. This plan is more risky, but if we win, we will be able to capture Sevastopol and part of the Black Sea Fleet."
crm.7.a:0 "Use the shaft to defent the peninsula."
crm.7.b:0 "Try to conquer Sevastopol!"

crm.8.t:0 "Rogoza's Army Has Been Repulsed"
crm.8.d:0 "Alexander Rogoza's army reached the isthmus fairly quickly, but our efforts to strengthen the moat contributed to the fact that we successfully repelled the attacks of the Ukrainian army and were even able to counterattack, pushing deeper into the mainland.\n\nAt the same time, we missed the Black Sea fleet, the main part of which left Sevastopol Bay, and the other firmly entrenched in the city, allowing the landing of additional Ukrainian divisions. The approaches to Sevastopol are blocked, and it seems that now we will not be able to recapture the city."
crm.8.a:0 "We lost the fleet!"

crm.9.t:0 "Sevastopol Captured!"
crm.9.d:0 "Due to the fact that we spent most of our forces on the capture of Sevastopol, we were able to successfully attack the Black Sea fleet and capture some of the ships along with the sailors who defected to our side.\n\nDespite the fact that part of the fleet was able to evacuate, the city is now under the full control of the Crimean Tatar forces. However, we paid the price, as Rogoza's army was able to break through the Perekop Isthmus and seize the initiative in the Northern Crimea. Before it's too late, we need to strengthen our positions there and organize an effective defense against the Ukrainian army."
crm.9.a:0 "Reinforce Northern Crimea as soon as possible!"

crm.10.t:0 "The Battle for the Northern Crimea"
crm.10.d:0 ""
crm.10.a:0 "Defend Simferopol and Bakhchisarai"
crm.10.b:0 "Try to regain control over Perekop and surround enemy."

crm.11.t:0 "Simferopol and Bakhchisarai Have Fallen"
crm.11.d:0 ""
crm.11.a:0 "Victory of the Ukrainian Forces!"

crm.12.t:0 "Simferopol and Bakhchisarai Defended!"
crm.12.d:0 ""
crm.12.a:0 "It seems the war has reached stalemate."

crm.13.t:0 "Delegation From [FROM.GetNameDef]"
crm.13.d:0 "A Crimean Tatar delegation arrived in Berlin to ask for mediation in negotiations with [UKR.GetName].\n\nDue to the agricultural crisis in Ukraine, local Crimean Tatar separatists rebelled against the Hetman and the King, demanding bread and tax cuts. Kiev did not come up with anything better than to brutally suppress the uprising, and now it has come to full-fledged military operations. At the moment, part of the Crimea has been captured by the troops of the Ukrainian army under the command of General Alexander Rogoza, but the Crimean Tatar militias demand full control over the entire peninsula, official recognition of their independence by Ukraine, and first of all, Germany, as a leading world power.\n\nOn the one hand, we can support the Crimean Tatar independence in exchange for the deployment of our overseas divisions in Crimea, as well as preferential terms for German companies.\n\nOn the other hand, it will undoubtedly definitely harm our relations with Ukraine and we may lose not only an important economic partner, but also encourage Ukraine to ally with Russia."
crm.13.a:0 "We cannot loose Ukraine."
crm.13.b:0 "We must have a reliable support on the Black Sea."

crm.14.t:0 "Germany Supported Ukraine!"
crm.14.d:0 "The German government has decided to support our enemies and refused to become a mediator in negotiations between our countries. It seems that we should find another ally or cope alone."
crm.14.a:0 "1918 Repeats."

crm.15.t:0 "Germany Demands We Recognize Crimea!"
crm.15.d:0 "Our Berlin partners has approached us with a demand to recognize the Crimean government and its authority over all of Peninsula.\nDespite the fact that this is in principle a gross violation of our rights to the peninsula, it casts doubt on our further cooperation with Germany. However, we can try to negotiate the preservation of Sevastopol for us, and thus have a base on the peninsula and annex Crimea at the right moment. This will also allow the Black Sea Fleet to return to its home harbor."
crm.15.a:0 "Threaten them with leaving the Reichspakt!"
crm.15.b:0 "Demand Sevastopol base and Black Sea Fleet back."
crm.15.e:0 "Demand Sevastopol base"
crm.15.f:0 "Demand Perekop Isthmus under our control."
crm.15.c:0 "We submit to the Kaiser's will."

crm.16.t:0 "Ukraine Threatens to Leave the Reichspakt!"
crm.16.d:0 "The Ukrainian government has threatened us with leaving the Reichspakt if we do not recognize their supremacy over the entire peninsula.\n\nWe can meet them halfway and deny Crimea self-determination in order not to lose a military ally and our breadbasket, but our troops are always ready to strike and restore order in Kiev."
crm.16.a:0 "No one sets terms for Kaiserreich!"
crm.16.b:0 "We cannot lose Ukraine."

crm.17.t:0 "Germany Сoncedes"
crm.17.d:0 "The Kaiserreich showed its weakness and made concessions to Ukraine, which means we are worth something in their eyes. Due to the inability to continue an effective military campaign against Crimea, we are forced to offer them a temporary peace, but as soon as we recover, we will come for them."
crm.17.a:0 "Victory!"

crm.18.t:0 "Germany Threatens Us With Force"
crm.18.d:0 "The Kaiserreich never shows its weaknesses and refused to make any concessions to us. Of course that means that we are on the verge of war with Reichspakt, but it worths it."
crm.18.a:0 "Khai Zhive, Zhive, Vilna Ukraina!"

crm.19.t:0 "Ukraine Demands Sevastopol and Black Sea Fleet"
crm.19.d:0 "The Ukrainian government suggested that they should keep Sevastopol as their base and also demanded the Crimean government to return the parts of the Black Sea Fleet that defected. While we can clearly see what they want from it, we can concede and perhaps even force Crimean Republic to comply with these terms. That would, however, deprive us from the direct access to the Crimea and the Black Sea, but we will save our more economically developed ally."
crm.19.a:0 "Offer these terms to the Crimean government."
crm.19.b:0 "OUR terms must be accepted."

crm.20.t:0 "Germany Refused!"
crm.20.d:0 "The Kaiserreich never shows its weaknesses and refused to make any concessions to us. We could still threaten them, or just accept their terms."
crm.20.a:0 "Threaten them with leaving the Reichspakt!"
crm.20.b:0 "Fine. We cannot risk our relations with Germans now."

crm.21.t:0 "Treaty of Berlin"
crm.21.d:0 "The German government has settled the disputes with the Ukrainian government and now has offered us the following terms of peace with Ukraine:\n\n1. [GER.GetNameDefCap] and [UKR.GetNameDefCap] recognize the authority of [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] over the whole Crimean Peninsula.\n2. The hostilities between [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] and [UKR.GetNameDefCap] should be over within two days inclusive.

German companies should be given preferential tax and business conditions."
crm.21.a:0 "Sign the treaty."
crm.21.b:0 "It's just a dirty piece of paper!"

crm.22.t:0 "Crimean Republic Refused the Terms"
crm.22.d:0 "The Crimean Republic has refused our generous terms. It seems that now we have nothing to do but allow Ukraine to go on with their war. Only fools reject treaties from Kaiserreich!"
crm.22.a:0 "Green light for Ukraine!"

crm.23.t:0 "Green Light From Germany!"
crm.23.d:0 "The Crimean Republic has foolishly refused the Kaiser's terms. We have been given green light to go on with Crimean war, but it seems that our troops are now in a stalemate and we need more time."

At the moment, part of the Crimea has been captured by the troops of the Ukrainian army under the command of General Alexander Rogoza, but the Crimean Tatar militias demand full control over the entire peninsula and official recognition of their independence by Ukraine.\n\nWe are united by centuries-old friendship with the Crimean Tatars, and on the one hand, we can support the independence of the Crimean Tatars, though in exchange for certain conditions. We can demand the restoration of the Crimean Khanate under the leadership of the Giray dynasty, whose representative, Sultan Kadyr Giray, chairman of the Circassian-Georgian Society, has been living in Constantinople since the 1920s. On the other hand, we can recognize the existing Republican government. We have nothing to do with Ukraine, but we cooperate with Berlin, which can put pressure on Ukraine. In any case, peace will be concluded only if the Ottoman troops enter the territory of the Crimea as defenders and protectors of the newly formed state."

crm.34.d:0 "In exchange for their help, the Ottomans offered to restore the Crimean Khanate under the leadership of a pretender from the Giray dynasty, Sultan Kadyr Giray, a descendant of Genghis Khan and the ruling dynasty of the Crimean Khanate.\n\nOn the one hand, this is quite fair, and the khanate restored in the format of a constitutional monarchy will strengthen our ties with the Ottoman Empire. On the other hand, some forces within our government will be against it. If we do not agree, the Ottomans may refuse to help us."
crm.34.a:0 "We agree."

crm.50.t:0 "Ukraine Withdraws From Crimea"

crm.51.d:0 "The Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from Crimea, which means our victory, thanks to the Ottoman and German mediation. However, we had to make some concessions to the Germans, giving them access to the Sevastopol port. The war for independence has ended as quickly as it started."
crm.51.a:0 "Great!"

crm.52.t:0 "Ukraine Refused to Withdraw!"
crm.52.d:0 "The Ukrainian government refused to withdraw, claiming the peninsula for themselves. We can try to put pressure on Ukraine, or we can turn directly to Berlin and demand that its allies calm down."

crm.55.d:0 "Despite the initial support for our government, the Ottomans cannot risk the war with Reichspakt and, therefore, they had to leave the negotiations. It seems that now we were left alone with Ukraine, and nothing can stop the war."

crm.61.d:0 "A Crimean Tatar delegation arrived in Petrograd to ask for our support of their independence against [UKR.GetName].\n\nDue to the agricultural crisis in Ukraine, local Crimean Tatar separatists rebelled against the Hetman and the King, demanding bread and tax cuts. Kiev did not come up with anything better than to brutally suppress the uprising, and now it has come to full-fledged military operations. At the moment, part of the Crimea has been captured by the troops of the Ukrainian army under the command of General Alexander Rogoza, but the Crimean Tatar militias demand full control over the entire peninsula and official recognition of their independence by Ukraine.\n\nSince the annexation of Crimea to Russia back in tsarist times, many Russian-speaking people live on the peninsula, making up a relative majority in many areas, so the safety of Crimeans should be a priority for us. On the other hand, support for Crimea now is undoubtedly a violation of the Minsk Agreement, which we are currently unable to cancel. We can try to come to an agreement with Ukraine to resolve the issue peacefully, but it is unknown whether we will be able to really influence the Ukrainian leadership. It is also important to note that the Crimean Tatar government is ruling in Crimea now, and, of course, it will act in the interests of its people, and we must make sure that the rights of Russians are not infringed."

crm.68.d:0 "Our partners from Moscow and Berlin have approached us with a demand to recognize the Crimean government and its authority over all of Peninsula.\nDespite the fact that this is in principle a gross violation of our rights to the peninsula, it casts doubt on our further cooperation with Germany. However, we can try to negotiate the preservation of Sevastopol for us, and thus have a base on the peninsula and annex Crimea at the right moment. This will also allow the Black Sea Fleet to return to its home harbor."

crm.1050.t:0 "Establish Crimean Directory"
crm.1050.d:0 "The War of Independence is over, and now it's time to sit down and focus on our internal affairs. The Extraordinary regional government of Krym wants to finally form a functioning, workable government for the next few years, but for this it is necessary to solve one main question - whether the already rather elderly Solomon should remain head of state, or resign, remembered by all Crimeans as a hero-liberator of Crimea from foreign influence, and appoint a younger, capable and energetic Crimean Tatar figure to the post of Prime-Minister of the Republic.\n\nThere are two candidates for the position of Solomon's successor. The first is Seidamet Jafer, an ideologue and one of the leaders of the Crimean Tatar people in the initial period of the Civil War, Minister of War and Minister of Foreign Affairs in the first government of the national hero of Crimea N. Celebijikhan and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Crimean regional government Sulkevich, until the resignation of the latter.\nThe second is Amet Ozenbashly, a candidate with a socialist bias in his views. He participated in the negotiations between the government of Sulkevich and the Hetman in 1918, and then did not emigrate and in 1920 became one of the founders of the agricultural organization "Shirket", which had branches in all regions of the Crimea and united members of the National Party. In addition, he became a member of the organization "Koch Yardim" ("Assistance to migrants"), which aimed to create favorable conditions for the return of Crimean Tatars from Turkey and the Bulgarian kingdom. Despite the fact that he stayed in Crimea after the occupation by Ukraine, it was only due to his patriotism and love for Crimea."

crm.106.t:0 "The Flag For Our Nation"
crm.106.d:0 "Since the time of the first Crimean People's Republic, an ordinary light blue canvas has been considered the national flag, however, the Directory believes that it is necessary to give the main national symbol some special features.\n\nThe first option is to add a yellow tamga of the Giray dynasty to the upper left corner, referring us to our great past.\n\nThe second option is to add a yellow stripe in the middle so that yellow and light blue officially symbolize our Crimean Tatar identity."

However, there is a possibility that this is exactly the tactical move they expect from us, and since Sevastopol is still under our control, there is a chance to hit them in the rear.\n\nIf we focus on attacking the Perekop Isthmus, there is a chance that the separatists will hold it with little blood, and the main forces will be thrown at Sevastopol to capture the Black Sea Fleet."
crm.107.a:0 "Try to invade Perekop."

crm.108.t:0 "Separatists Have Been Repulsed"

However, we have already seized Perekop and now we should decide if we should relocate our forces to the North and jointly attack Simferopol and Bakhchisarai, or try to recapture Sevastopol with parts of our fleet."
crm.108.a:0 "We must try to reinforce Sevastopol"
crm.108.b:0 "Strike Simferopol and Bakhchisarai with joint forces."

crm.109.t:0 "Sevastopol Defended!"
crm.109.d:0 "Due to the fact that we spent most of our forces on the defense of Sevastopol, we were able to successfully attack the separatists and keep the Black Sea fleet under our control.\n\nHowever, we paid the price, as separatists were able to break through the Perekop Isthmus and seize the initiative in the Taurida. Before it's too late, we need to strengthen our positions there and organize an effective defense against the separatists."

Current flag uses the outline of the Crimean peninsula with four stars, representing four main nationalities of our country: Crimean Tatars, Russians, Ukrainians and Karaites. There are also two stripes: red in the upper part of the banner and yellow in the lower one.\n\nWe can adopt another flag, which will have only red stripes or another one, which will have only yellow stripes."

Russian Russians, unlike the rest of Ukraine, the situation here is particularly acute, since the Russian population here is an absolute majority, both in comparison with Ukrainians and in comparison with Russians. The policy of Ukrainization carried out over the past 15 years has only worsened the situation, and we have to constantly make concessions to the Russians. However, surrounded on all sides by anti-Russian countries and the sea, perhaps no one will save them in time."

CRM_khazar_revival_society:0 "Krymkaraylar Influence"
CRM_khazar_revival_society_desc:0 "Seraya Shapshal, or, as he is called, His Excellency Hajji Seraya Khan Shapshal, is a spiritual leader of the Tatar Karaims, a Jewish religious movement. Since 1911 he has been the hakham of the Tauride and Odessa Karaite spiritual board and under his patronage the Jewish rights of Crimeans were respected. The Hetman's rule changed everything, when the policy of Ukrainisation, even if it was not as harsh as Shapshal imagined, made him openly speak against King, criticize Hetman and start public discussion about Jewish autonomy in the Crimea. He is not as simple as he seems, and in the future he can become a serious problem."

CRM_khazar_revival_society_1:0 "Khazar Revival Society"
CRM_khazar_revival_society_1_desc:0 "With our republic finally becoming independent from the Ukraine, the Karaite influence and Shapshal's authority has grown a lot. In fact, to the extent where he proclaimed the restoration of Khazar Khaganate under his rule. This is a pure nonsense, but such influential person as Shapshal can turn the Jewish population against us."

CRM_khazar_revival_society_2:0 "Dreams of Khazar Khaganate"
CRM_khazar_revival_society_2_desc:0 "The Khazar Revival Society under His Excellency Hajji Seraya Khan Shapshal have seized power in Crimea, efficiently removing all non-Jewish from official positions. The dream of restoring the Khazar Khaganate is still in the air, and the desire of our nation to fight for it has grown as well."

However, the growth of the urban population and industrialization complicates this problem.\n\nThe current government plan is to expand the existing system of reservoirs and build at least two new ones, as well as to create a North Crimean Canal for pumping water from the Dnieper River, as well as water supplies from other countries.\n\nWater Supplies Monthly Change: £water [?CRM_water_supplies|+=0]"
