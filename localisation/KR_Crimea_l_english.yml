### Events ###
crm.1.t: "Modern Crimean History"
crm.1.d: "The Crimean Peninsula has been a fusion of many cultures and nationalities since ancient times, including Greeks, Romans, Khazars, Polovtsians, Genoese, and finally, Russians, Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars.\n\nThe modern history of Crimea begins in 1917, when, in the wake of revolutionary events in Russia, the first Turkic republic, the Crimean People's Republic, appeared on the fragments of a once great empire. The elected Kurultai of the Crimean Tatars proclaimed the independence of the Crimean state, but soon after that the island was conquered by Bolshevik-minded forces who were able to hold power for only a few months. Nevertheless, during these few months, a terrible red terror broke out in Crimea, which claimed the lives of many people.\n\nIn June 1918, the peninsula was occupied by the Kaiser's troops and power passed to the pro-German Crimean Regional Government under the leadership of Suleiman Sulkevich. All government activities were under the full control of the occupation command. In July 1918, a government delegation visited Berlin in order to achieve recognition by the German government of the independence of Crimea from Ukraine, to receive loans from it and establish trade relations with Germany. Behind the scenes, the German government was also offered a memorandum by the Crimean Tatar Directory on the creation of the Crimean Khanate under the patronage of Germany and Turkey. However, these proposals did not receive support in Berlin.\n\nCrimea's relations with the Skoropadsky government initially did not work out. In September - October, the Crimean-Ukrainian negotiations were held in Kiev, at which the Ukrainian delegation proposed that Crimea become part of Ukraine on the rights of extremely broad autonomy. The Crimean delegation made a counter-proposal: the creation of a federal union. Unfortunately, it was not possible to come to an agreement, and as a result, by the end of the year, Crimea became fully part of Hetman Ukraine. Sulkevich's government resigned, and the new one under the leadership of Solomon Krym announced the creation of the government of the Crimean Republic in exile. Despite the presence of occupation troops, anarchist and Bolshevik forces continued sabotage and terror, until the end of the war, when the territory of the whole of Ukraine was completely liberated from all red scum.\n\nThus, since 1919, Crimea has been under the full authority of the Hetmanate, and despite a small autonomy for the local population, it underwent Ukrainization in the 1920s. Now that Hetman Ukraine is in a protracted crisis, the government in exile has returned to give the peoples inhabiting Crimea their legitimate territories."
crm.1.a: "Ant Etkenmen!"

crm.2.t: "The Divided Peninsula"
crm.2.d: "Crimea is inhabited by various peoples, but in general, the 4 most numerous stand out: Russians, who make up about 40% of the population, Ukrainians, who make up about 30%, Crimean Tatars, who make up about 20%, as well as Crimeans, Karaites and others.\n\nNow the government of Solomon Krym, which has supreme authority over the peninsula, in fact represents only 20% of the population, while the Russian majority, the Ukrainian and Jewish minorities are alienated from the governance of the state. Despite the fact that the Government declares the freedom of expression of the will of the people immediately after the acquisition of sovereignty by the peninsula, their true intentions are questioned.\n\nRussian Russian majority, at the same time, is in some political isolation, as it does not border with Russia either by land or by sea, and is surrounded either by the water or by anti-Russian-minded countries. In addition, there is no significant political organization in Crimea that defends the rights of Russians.\n\nHowever, the Karaite minority stands out in particular - the Turkic population, which professes one of the currents of Judaism. The leader of their community is Gahan Seraya Shapshal, known for his eccentric statements and unhealthy interest in the history of the Khazar Khaganate."
crm.2.a: "Interesting"

crm.3.t: "Local Insurgency in the Crimea!"
crm.3.d: "Local clashes with the Hetman's army, as well as protests against the King and the Hetman, began among the local population in Crimea, mainly Crimean Tatars. Minorities who are dissatisfied with the agricultural crisis, inflation and, in general, our policy demand bread, lower taxes and higher wages. Despite the fact that our economy cannot afford extra expenses now, we can try to avoid further conflict and reduce taxes for Crimeans and hope that this will calm the population."
crm.3.a: "Suppress the insurgency!"
crm.3.b: "Ease the tax burden for Crimeans."

crm.4.t: "Solomon Krym Returns to the Crimea"
crm.4.d: "We have received information that Solomon Krym, the so-called leader of the "government of the Crimean People's Republic in exile" illegally crossed the border with our country and somehow penetrated into Crimea, probably from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nSolomon Krym was one of the leaders of the Crimean Tatar national movement, being in opposition to the first Crimean regional government of Sulkevich. Before the Civil War, he headed an agricultural society in the Crimea and did a lot for the development of horticulture and viticulture of the region. He participated in many charitable foundations, founded scholarships, financed the activities of the Karadag scientific Station, archaeological excavations on the peninsula and publishing activities.\n\nAfter Sulkevich's Crimean republic was absorbed by Ukraine, Solomon Crimea declared himself the new prime minister and founded a government in exile, remaining its undisputed leader all these years. Now he's in Crimea, and we should probably expect separatist unrest on the peninsula."
crm.4.a: "We must find him before he could rally people"

crm.5.t: "Separatism in Crimea"
crm.5.d: "As expected, upon arriving on the peninsula, Solomon Crimea began actively promoting separatism and the national independence of the Crimean Tatars. His speech in Bakhchisarai gathered a large rally, and many began to arm themselves against our government, seizing towns and villages.\n\nIt is urgently necessary to restore order in the region, but for this it is proposed to introduce martial law in the entire Tauride District, as well as prepare the Black Sea Fleet either for evacuation or for the suppression of a separatist uprising.\n\nOleksandr Rogoza, an outstanding Ukrainian military commander, was appointed temporary governor of the Tauride district and responsible for suppressing the Crimean uprising."
crm.5.a: "Send our best general to deal with crisis."

crm.6.t: "Tavria Okruha"
crm.6.d: "So, a curfew and martial law were imposed throughout the Tauride district, Oleksandr Rogoza arrived in the district with an armed division in order to suppress the uprising.\n\nBy this time, the militias were able to establish control over almost the entire peninsula, with the exception of some individual parts with a Ukrainian majority and Sevastopol.\n\nGeneral Rogoza will have to seize the Isthmus of Perekop and, with the help of the Black Sea Fleet, regain control of the peninsula, arrest Solomon Krym and suppress the separatist uprising."
crm.6.a: "Oleksandr Rogoza will deal with the insurgency."
crm.6.b: "The separatism should be destroyed! (Play as Tavria Okruha)"
crm.6.c: "Down with Ukrainians! (Play as Independent Crimea)"

crm.7.t: "Perekop Shaft"
crm.7.d: "We need to gain a foothold on the Perekop Isthmus and successfully counterattack General Rogoza's divisions. While we have some time to prepare, we can strengthen the ancient Perekopsky rampart - a defensive structure consisting of a deep moat in order to gain a firm foothold on the peninsula and switch attention to Sevastopol, hoping to seize control of the city - and, first of all, over the fleet.\n\nOn the other hand, we can abandon attempts to reconstruct the ancient rampart and switch all the main attention to Sevastopol, leaving a small garrison on the isthmus, which can easily repel the attacks of the Ukrainian army. This plan is more risky, but if we win, we will be able to capture Sevastopol and part of the Black Sea Fleet."
crm.7.a: "Use the shaft to defend the peninsula."
crm.7.b: "Try to conquer Sevastopol!"

crm.8.t: "Rogoza's Army Has Been Repulsed"
crm.8.d: "Alexander Rogoza's army reached the isthmus fairly quickly, but our efforts to strengthen the moat contributed to the fact that we successfully repelled the attacks of the Ukrainian army and were even able to counterattack, pushing deeper into the mainland.\n\nAt the same time, we missed the Black Sea fleet, the main part of which left Sevastopol Bay, and the other firmly entrenched in the city, allowing the landing of additional Ukrainian divisions. The approaches to Sevastopol are blocked, and it seems that now we will not be able to recapture the city."
crm.8.a: "We lost the fleet!"

crm.9.t: "Sevastopol Captured!"
crm.9.d: "Due to the fact that we spent most of our forces on the capture of Sevastopol, we were able to successfully attack the Black Sea fleet and capture some of the ships along with the sailors who defected to our side.\n\nDespite the fact that part of the fleet was able to evacuate, the city is now under the full control of the Crimean Tatar forces. However, we paid the price, as Rogoza's army was able to break through the Perekop Isthmus and seize the initiative in the Northern Crimea. Before it's too late, we need to strengthen our positions there and organize an effective defense against the Ukrainian army."
crm.9.a: "Reinforce Northern Crimea as soon as possible!"

crm.10.t: "The Battle for the Northern Crimea"
crm.10.d: "The Ukrainian military successfully occupied the Perekop isthmus and gained a foothold in the northern Crimea. Now we have to decide on our further actions. One of the options is to protect our key cities - Simferopol and Bakhchisarai, with the loss of which our uprising will be doomed to failure. On the other hand, we can try to capture Perekop and surround the enemy - a more risky, but effective plan, since if we win, we will break up large enemy detachments."
crm.10.a: "Defend Simferopol and Bakhchisarai"
crm.10.b: "Try to regain control over Perekop and surround enemy."

crm.11.t: "Simferopol and Bakhchisarai Have Fallen"
crm.11.d: "The Ukrainian army was able to outwit us and, while we were trying to encircle it, attacked the almost unprotected Simferopol and Bakhchisarai, gaining a foothold in the cities and hanging their flags there. Without these cities, our uprising quickly descended into a partisan movement, which was also soon defeated. We lost."
crm.11.a: "Victory of the Ukrainian Forces!"

crm.12.t: "Simferopol and Bakhchisarai Defended!"
crm.12.d: "We were able to defend Simferopol and Bakhchisarai, successfully repelling enemy attacks, and proving that our armed forces, despite their unprofessional nature, can be effective. The war has reached a point where neither side can attack effectively. We have lost the Northern Crimea, but we have preserved key and strategically important facilities and cities."
crm.12.a: "It seems the war has reached stalemate."

crm.13.t: "Delegation From [FROM.GetNameDef]"
crm.13.d: "A Crimean Tatar delegation arrived in Berlin to ask for mediation in negotiations with [UKR.GetName].\n\nDue to the agricultural crisis in Ukraine, local Crimean Tatar separatists rebelled against the Hetman and the King, demanding bread and tax cuts. Kiev did not come up with anything better than to brutally suppress the uprising, and now it has come to full-fledged military operations. At the moment, part of the Crimea has been captured by the troops of the Ukrainian army under the command of General Alexander Rogoza, but the Crimean Tatar militias demand full control over the entire peninsula, official recognition of their independence by Ukraine, and first of all, Germany, as a leading world power.\n\nOn the one hand, we can support the Crimean Tatar independence in exchange for the deployment of our overseas divisions in Crimea, as well as preferential terms for German companies.\n\nOn the other hand, it will undoubtedly definitely harm our relations with Ukraine and we may lose not only an important economic partner, but also encourage Ukraine to ally with Russia."
crm.13.a: "We cannot lose Ukraine."
crm.13.b: "We must have a reliable support on the Black Sea."

crm.14.t: "Germany Supported Ukraine!"
crm.14.d: "The German government has decided to support our enemies and refused to become a mediator in negotiations between our countries. It seems that we should find another ally or cope alone."
crm.14.a: "1918 Repeats."

crm.15.t: "Germany Demands We Recognize Crimea!"
crm.15.d: "Our Berlin partners has approached us with a demand to recognize the Crimean government and its authority over all of Peninsula.\nDespite the fact that this is in principle a gross violation of our rights to the peninsula, it casts doubt on our further cooperation with Germany. However, we can try to negotiate the preservation of Sevastopol for us, and thus have a base on the peninsula and annex Crimea at the right moment. This will also allow the Black Sea Fleet to return to its home harbor."
crm.15.a: "Threaten them with leaving the Reichspakt!"
crm.15.b: "Demand Sevastopol base and Black Sea Fleet back."
crm.15.e: "Demand Sevastopol base"
crm.15.f: "Demand Perekop Isthmus under our control."
crm.15.c: "We submit to the Kaiser's will."

crm.16.t: "Ukraine Threatens to Leave the Reichspakt!"
crm.16.d: "The Ukrainian government has threatened us with leaving the Reichspakt if we do not recognize their supremacy over the entire peninsula.\n\nWe can meet them halfway and deny Crimea self-determination in order not to lose a military ally and our breadbasket, but our troops are always ready to strike and restore order in Kiev."
crm.16.a: "No one sets terms for Kaiserreich!"
crm.16.b: "We cannot lose Ukraine."

crm.17.t: "Germany Сoncedes"
crm.17.d: "The Kaiserreich showed its weakness and made concessions to Ukraine, which means we are worth something in their eyes. Due to the inability to continue an effective military campaign against Crimea, we are forced to offer them a temporary peace, but as soon as we recover, we will come for them."
crm.17.a: "Victory!"

crm.18.t: "Germany Threatens Us With Force"
crm.18.d: "The Kaiserreich never shows its weaknesses and refused to make any concessions to us. Of course that means that we are on the verge of war with Reichspakt, but it worths it."
crm.18.a: "Khai Zhive, Zhive, Vilna Ukraina!"

crm.19.t: "Ukraine Demands Sevastopol and Black Sea Fleet"
crm.19.d: "The Ukrainian government suggested that they should keep Sevastopol as their base and also demanded the Crimean government to return the parts of the Black Sea Fleet that defected. While we can clearly see what they want from it, we can concede and perhaps even force Crimean Republic to comply with these terms. That would, however, deprive us from the direct access to the Crimea and the Black Sea, but we will save our more economically developed ally."
crm.19.a: "Offer these terms to the Crimean government."
crm.19.b: "OUR terms must be accepted."

crm.20.t: "Germany Refused!"
crm.20.d: "The Kaiserreich never shows its weaknesses and refused to make any concessions to us. We could still threaten them, or just accept their terms."
crm.20.a: "Threaten them with leaving the Reichspakt!"
crm.20.b: "Fine. We cannot risk our relations with Germans now."

crm.21.t: "Treaty of Berlin"
crm.21.d: "The German government has settled the disputes with the Ukrainian government and now has offered us the following terms of peace with Ukraine:\n\n1. [GER.GetNameDefCap] and [UKR.GetNameDefCap] recognize the authority of [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] over the whole Crimean Peninsula.\n2. The hostilities between [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] and [UKR.GetNameDefCap] should be over within two days inclusive. [UKR.GetNameDefCap] should withdraw its forces from the Crimean Peninsula within one month.\n3. The Perekop Isthmus shall become a demilitarized zone for 2 years.\n4.[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] should have military and naval access to the port of Sevastopol\n5. German companies should be given preferential tax and business conditions."
crm.21.a: "Sign the treaty."
crm.21.b: "It's just a dirty piece of paper!"

crm.22.t: "Crimean Republic Refused the Terms"
crm.22.d: "The Crimean Republic has refused our generous terms. It seems that now we have nothing to do but allow Ukraine to go on with their war. Only fools reject treaties from Kaiserreich!"
crm.22.a: "Green light for Ukraine!"

crm.23.t: "Green Light From Germany!"
crm.23.d: "The Crimean Republic has foolishly refused the Kaiser's terms. We have been given green light to go on with Crimean war, but it seems that our troops are now in a stalemate and we need more time."
crm.23.a: "Fools."

crm.24.t: "Treaty of Berlin"
crm.24.d: "The German government has settled the disputes with the Ukrainian government and now has offered us the following terms of peace with Ukraine:\n\n1. [GER.GetNameDefCap] and [UKR.GetNameDefCap] recognize the authority of [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] over the Crimean Peninsula, excluding the city of Sevastopol, which will remain a Ukrainian territory.\n2. The Black Sea Fleet defectors and ships should be returned to [UKR.GetNameDefCap].\n3. The hostilities between [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] and [UKR.GetNameDefCap] should be over within two days inclusive. [UKR.GetNameDefCap] should withdraw its forces from the Crimean Peninsula within one month.\n4. The Perekop Isthmus shall become a demilitarized zone for 2 years.\n5. German companies should be given preferential tax and business conditions." 
crm.24.a: "Sign the treaty."
crm.24.b: "It's just a dirty piece of paper!"

crm.25.t: "Ukraine Demands Sevastopol"
crm.25.d: "The Ukrainian government suggested that they should keep Sevastopol as their base.

crm.30.a: "Sign the treaty."
crm.30.b: "It's just a dirty piece of paper!"

crm.31.t: "Mobilise Against Crimea?"
crm.31.d: "It seems that nothing could help resolving the Crimean crisis peacefully. There is a stalemate on the island and we should either suggest a temporary armistice to the Crimean Government and hope to reconquer them later or outright declare war on them, mobilising all our forces."
crm.31.a: "Offer them armistice."
crm.31.b: "Declare war on them!"

crm.32.t: "Armistice With Ukraine"
crm.32.d: "The Ukrainian government has approached us with a temporary armistice, because of the stalemate. Today we have signed this treaty, though formally we are still in a state of war, we can take out time and be ready for their next strike."
crm.32.a: "Independence!"

crm.33.t: "Delegation From [FROM.GetNameDef]"
crm.33.d: "A Crimean Tatar delegation arrived in Constantinople to ask for mediation in negotiations with [UKR.GetName].\n\nDue to the agricultural crisis in Ukraine, local Crimean Tatar separatists rebelled against the Hetman and the King, demanding bread and tax cuts. Kiev did not come up with anything better than to brutally suppress the uprising, and now it has come to full-fledged military operations. At the moment, part of the Crimea has been captured by the troops of the Ukrainian army under the command of General Alexander Rogoza, but the Crimean Tatar militias demand full control over the entire peninsula and official recognition of their independence by Ukraine.\n\nWe are united by centuries-old friendship with the Crimean Tatars, and on the one hand, we can support the independence of the Crimean Tatars, though in exchange for certain conditions. We can demand the restoration of the Crimean Khanate under the leadership of the Giray dynasty, whose representative, Sultan Kadyr Giray, chairman of the Circassian-Georgian Society, has been living in Constantinople since the 1920s. On the other hand, we can recognize the existing Republican government. We have nothing to do with Ukraine, but we cooperate with Berlin, which can put pressure on Ukraine. In any case, peace will be concluded only if the Ottoman troops enter the territory of the Crimea as defenders and protectors of the newly formed state."
crm.33.a: "Suggest restoration of the Khanate."
crm.33.b: "Support their government and demand Ukraine to withdraw."
crm.33.c: "We have no interest in Crimea."

crm.34.t: "[FROM.GetName] Suggests Restoration of the Khanate"
crm.34.d: "In exchange for their help, the Ottomans offered to restore the Crimean Khanate under the leadership of a pretender from the Giray dynasty, Sultan Kadyr Giray, a descendant of Genghis Khan and the ruling dynasty of the Crimean Khanate.\n\nOn the one hand, this is quite fair, and the khanate restored in the format of a constitutional monarchy will strengthen our ties with the Ottoman Empire. On the other hand, some forces within our government will be against it. If we do not agree, the Ottomans may refuse to help us."
crm.34.a: "We agree."
crm.34.b: "We are a modern state, no need to return back to 1700s."

crm.35.t: "Crimea Refused!"
crm.35.d: "The Crimean government has refused to install the Khanate, insisting on our recognition of the republican rule."
crm.35.a: "Support their government and demand Ukraine to withdraw."
crm.35.b: "We have no interest in Crimea."

crm.36.t: "Crimea Agreed!"
crm.36.d: "The Crimean government has agreed to install the Khanate regime, even though the Khan will be more of a figurehead, then have any power. This is still good, as it traces us back to our old right to place the Khan of Crimea on its throne. We must send a demand to the Ukrainian government that the Crimea is now under our protection."
crm.36.a: "Demand they withdraw their forces!"

crm.37.t: "Ottoman Empire Demands to Withdraw From the Crimea!"
crm.37.d: "The government of the Ottoman Empire has recognized the Crimean government and became their protector, placing their troops on the peninsula. They demanded that we should withdraw our forces from the peninsula and recognize the Crimean government."
crm.37.a: "Agree, but keep the territories occupied by us."
crm.37.b: "Withdraw from Crimea completely."
crm.37.c: "Crimea is ours. We will fight for it."

crm.38.t: "Ukraine Keeps Some Territories In Crimea"
crm.38.d: "The Ukrainian government agreed to withdraw, but they kept the land on the peninsula they occupied previously under their direct control. The Crimean government is dissatisfied with this, demanding control over the entire peninsula. We can try to put pressure on Ukraine, or we can turn directly to Berlin and demand that its allies calm down."
crm.38.a: "Demand full withdrawal of their forces."
crm.38.b: "Call Berlin."

crm.39.t: "Ottomans Demand Full Withdrawal"
crm.39.d: "The Ottomans still demand our full withdrawal from the island. Nevertheless, they won't risk the war with us so we can just ignore their ultimatumes."
crm.39.a: "Just ignore them."

crm.40.t: "Ukraine Ignores Us"
crm.40.d: "It seems that the Ukrainian government has ignored our ultimatum and they still occupy some part of the peninsula. While we cannot allow us to fight overseas now, it seems that we should just consider this as a matter of fact."
crm.40.a: "We have nothing to do with this."

crm.41.t: "Ottomans Demand We Calm Down Ukraine"
crm.41.d: "The Crimean crisis is still ongoing with the Crimean government asking for Ottoman support and now the Ukrainian forces refuse to withdraw from some parts of Crimea occupied by them.\n\nThe Ottomans demand their full withdrawal from the Crimea and asked for our mediation in reaching up to Ukraine."
crm.41.a: "We won't interfere."
crm.41.b: "In this case we should have access to Sevastopol."
crm.41.c: "Demand Ukrainian submission!"

crm.42.t: "Germany Refused to Interfere"
crm.42.d: "Germany refused to intervene in the conflict and support any side. Without their mediation, it seems that we should repeat our demands to the Ukrainian government."
crm.42.a: "The crisis shall end soon."

crm.43.t: "Germany Demands Access to Sevastopol"
crm.43.d: "Germany agreed to help, but demanded that they should have access to the Sevastopol bay, so it secures its Black Sea port."
crm.43.a: "We agree."
crm.43.b: "Do they understand what full withdrawal means?"

crm.44.t: "Ottomans Agree"
crm.44.d: "The Ottomans have agreed to allow us have access to the Sevastopol port. With this term finally negotiated, we can now start demanding Ukrainian government to withdraw."
crm.44.a: "The Ukrainians must submit."

crm.45.t: "Ottoman Refuse"
crm.45.d: "The Ottomans have refused our access to the Sevastopol port, reminding that no Reichspakt country should have any land in the Crimea."
crm.45.a: "We won't interfere then."
crm.45.b: "Let them have it already!"

crm.46.t: "Germany Demands To Withdraw!"
crm.46.d: "The Ottomans have asked the Germans to interfere in the conflict, and now our masters in Berlin demand that we should fully withdraw. We should either listen to our allies, or threaten them with leaving the Reichspakt."
crm.46.a: "As you say, Willy."
crm.46.b: "Threaten them with leaving the Reichspakt!"

crm.47.t: "Ukraine Threatens to Leave the Reichspakt!"
crm.47.d: "The Ukrainian government has threatened us with leaving the Reichspakt if we do not recognize their supremacy over the entire peninsula.\n\nWe can meet them halfway and deny Crimea self-determination in order not to lose a military ally and our breadbasket, but our troops are always ready to strike and restore order in Kiev."
crm.47.a: "No one sets terms for Kaiserreich!"

Due to the inability to continue an effective military campaign against Crimea, we are forced to offer them a temporary peace, but as soon as we recover, we will come for them."
crm.48.a: "Victory!"

crm.49.t: "Germany Threatens Us With Force"
crm.49.d: "The Kaiserreich never shows its weaknesses and refused to make any concessions to us. Of course that means that we are on the verge of war with Reichspakt, but it worths it."
crm.49.a: "Khai Zhive, Zhive, Vilna Ukraina!"

crm.50.t: "Ukraine Withdraws From Crimea"
crm.50.d: "The Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from Crimea, which means our victory, thanks to the Ottoman mediation. The war for independence has ended as quickly as it started."
crm.50.a: "Great!"

crm.51.t: "Ukraine Withdraws From Crimea"
crm.51.d: "The Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from Crimea, which means our victory, thanks to the Ottoman and German mediation. However, we had to make some concessions to the Germans, giving them access to the Sevastopol port. The war for independence has ended as quickly as it started."
crm.51.a: "Great!"

crm.52.t: "Ukraine Refused to Withdraw!"
crm.52.d: "The Ukrainian government refused to withdraw, claiming the peninsula for themselves. We can try to put pressure on Ukraine, or we can turn directly to Berlin and demand that its allies calm down."
crm.52.a: "Demand full withdrawal of their forces."
crm.52.b: "Call Berlin."

crm.53.t: "Ottomans Demands Once Again"
crm.53.d: "The Ottomans have once again demanded our withdrawal and seemingly they don't understand that we refuse to do it. Everything will stay as it is."
crm.53.a: "Just ignore them."

crm.54.t: "Ottomans Refused to Support Us!"
crm.54.d: "The Ottomans have traitorously abandondes us in our attempt to reclaim independence for our people. It seems that now we were left alone with Ukraine, and nothing can stop the war."
crm.54.a: "Ottoman Betrayal!"

crm.55.t: "Ottomans Can't Help Us!"
crm.55.d: "Despite the initial support for our government, the Ottomans cannot risk the war with Reichspakt and, therefore, they had to leave the negotiations. It seems that now we were left alone with Ukraine, and nothing can stop the war."
crm.55.a: "Ottoman Betrayal!"

crm.56.t: "The Crisis Ends in Status-Quo"
crm.56.d: "The Ottomans cannot risk the war with the Reichspakt and Berlin did not give in their requests, so now we have to deal with Ukrainian presence on the peninsula. However, it is unlikely they would risk the war with us, at least for now."
crm.56.a: "Peace, at least."

crm.57.t: "Ukraine Ignores Us"
crm.57.d: "It seems that the Ukrainian government has ignored our ultimatum and they still occupy some part of the peninsula. While we cannot allow us to fight overseas now, it seems that we should just consider this as a matter of fact."
crm.57.a: "We have nothing to do with this."

crm.58.t: "The Crisis Ends in Status-Quo"
crm.58.d: "Unfortunately, we could not find an effective solution for signing peace, and it seems that the Crimean conflict has ended with the status quo, with each side retaining its claims and temporarily occupied territories."
crm.58.a: "We will get to them later."

crm.60.t: "Rebirth of the Crimean Khanate"
crm.60.d: "Sultan Kadyr of the House of Giray will become the first Crimean khan since 1863. The once great Khanate, whose rulers for a long time held control over the entire Ukrainian Black Sea coast and the mouth of the Dnieper, effectively "protecting" access to the sea from the Slavs, whose rulers organized successful campaigns against Moscow, was again restored under the protectorate of the Ottoman Empire."
crm.60.a: "The ancient dynasty is at the head again!"

crm.61.t: "Delegation From [FROM.GetNameDef]"
crm.61.d: "A Crimean Tatar delegation arrived in Petrograd to ask for our support of their independence against [UKR.GetName].\n\nDue to the agricultural crisis in Ukraine, local Crimean Tatar separatists rebelled against the Hetman and the King, demanding bread and tax cuts. Kiev did not come up with anything better than to brutally suppress the uprising, and now it has come to full-fledged military operations. At the moment, part of the Crimea has been captured by the troops of the Ukrainian army under the command of General Alexander Rogoza, but the Crimean Tatar militias demand full control over the entire peninsula and official recognition of their independence by Ukraine.\n\nSince the annexation of Crimea to Russia back in tsarist times, many Russian-speaking people live on the peninsula, making up a relative majority in many areas, so the safety of Crimeans should be a priority for us. On the other hand, support for Crimea now is undoubtedly a violation of the Minsk Agreement, which we are currently unable to cancel. We can try to come to an agreement with Ukraine to resolve the issue peacefully, but it is unknown whether we will be able to really influence the Ukrainian leadership. It is also important to note that the Crimean Tatar government is ruling in Crimea now, and, of course, it will act in the interests of its people, and we must make sure that the rights of Russians are not infringed."
crm.61.a: "Demand wide autonomy for Russians."
crm.61.b: "Support their government and demand Ukraine to withdraw."
crm.61.c: "We have no interest in Crimea."

crm.62.t: "Russia Demands Wide Autonomy for Russians"
crm.62.d: "The Russian government has agreed to support us if we give wide autonomy to the Russians. While we are mostly Crimean Tatar-oriented, we understand the importance of the Russian autonomy and can agree. However, the demand of wide autonomy is probably too much..."
crm.62.a: "Alright!"
crm.62.b: "The Russians overstep the mark!"

crm.63.t: "Crimean Government Agrees!"
crm.63.d: "The Crimean Government has agreed to give wide autonomy for Russians, so now we can sit down and focus on negotiations with Ukraine."
crm.63.a: "Demand Ukrainian withdrawal!"

crm.64.t: "Crimean Government Refused!"
crm.64.d: "The Crimean government has refused to give wide autonomy for Russians, claiming that we overstep the mark and that the Russians are not humiliated in rights. This is a clear lie, because we now for sure that the Crimean government consists of no Russians."
crm.64.a: "An end to our partnership."
crm.64.b: "We still can find profit in supporting them now."

crm.65.t: "Russia Tries to Intervene in Crimean Crisis!"
crm.65.d: "Due to the agricultural crisis in Ukraine, local Crimean Tatar separatists rebelled against the Hetman and the King, demanding bread and tax cuts. Kiev did not come up with anything better than to brutally suppress the uprising, and now it has come to full-fledged military operations. At the moment, part of the Crimea has been captured by the troops of the Ukrainian army under the command of General Alexander Rogoza, but the Crimean Tatar militias demand full control over the entire peninsula and official recognition of their independence by Ukraine.\n\nWe have received information that Russia intends to invade the conflict and demand Ukraine to leave the Crimean peninsula, but we can regard this as a violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, which means that their actions are illegal and run counter to the Minsk Agreement.\n\nWe can immediately demand that Russia stop all negotiations with Ukraine and deal directly with us, or forget about the Crimean issue altogether.\n\nOn the other hand, we can close our eyes to this misunderstanding. Of course, we don't need a strong Russia, but a weak Ukraine..."
crm.65.a: "Demand Russia respect Minsk Treaty!"
crm.65.b: "Russia should talk directly to us."

crm.66.t: "Germany Demands to Respect the Minsk Treaty!"
crm.66.d: "The German government has approached us on behalf of Ukrainian allies and told that our interest in Crimea violates the Minsk Treaty. Therefore, they demand that we immediately cease all contacts with Ukraine about the Crimean situation and forget about this region."
crm.66.a: "They will pay for it, but not now, unfortunately"

crm.67.t: "Germany Becomes Ukraine's Representative In Negotiations"
crm.67.d: "The German government has approached us on behalf of Ukrainian allies and told that we should settle all disputes directly with them. By doing this, Germany definetely wants to show that it is the master of our Ukrainian brothers and the outcome of the negotiations with a high probability it will be on their side."
crm.67.a: "Eh, sure, let's talk to them."

crm.68.t: "Germany and Russia Demands We Recognize Crimea!"
crm.68.d: "Our partners from Moscow and Berlin have approached us with a demand to recognize the Crimean government and its authority over all of Peninsula.\nDespite the fact that this is in principle a gross violation of our rights to the peninsula, it casts doubt on our further cooperation with Germany. However, we can try to negotiate the preservation of Sevastopol for us, and thus have a base on the peninsula and annex Crimea at the right moment. This will also allow the Black Sea Fleet to return to its home harbor."
crm.68.a: "Threaten them with leaving the Reichspakt!"
crm.68.b: "Demand Sevastopol base and Black Sea Fleet back."
crm.68.e: "Demand Sevastopol base"
crm.68.f: "Demand Perekop Isthmus under our control."
crm.68.c: "We submit to the Kaiser's will."

crm.69.t: "Ukraine Demands Sevastopol and Black Sea Fleet"
crm.69.d: "The Ukrainian government suggested that they should keep Sevastopol as their base and also demanded the Crimean government to return the parts of the Black Sea Fleet that defected. While we can clearly see what they want from it, we can concede and perhaps even force Crimean Republic to comply with these terms. That would, however, deprive us from the direct access to the Crimea and the Black Sea, but we will save our more economically developed ally."
crm.69.a: "Offer these terms to the Russian government."
crm.69.b: "OUR terms must be accepted."

crm.70.t: "Germany Refused!"
crm.70.d: "The Kaiserreich never shows its weaknesses and refused to make any concessions to us. We cannot threaten them, what if they have some sort of secret treaty with Russian and they will outright invade if we leave Reichspakt or just accept their terms."
crm.70.b: "Fine. We cannot risk our relations with Germans now."

crm.71.t: "Treaty of Kiev"
crm.71.d: "The German government has settled the disputes with the Ukrainian government and now has offered us the following terms of peace with Ukraine:\n\n1. [GER.GetNameDefCap], [UKR.GetNameDefCap] and [RUS.GetNameDefCap] recognize the authority of [CRM.GetNameDefCap] over the whole Crimean Peninsula.\n2. The hostilities between [CRM.GetNameDefCap] and [UKR.GetNameDefCap] should be over within two days inclusive.

crm.71.b: "We demand better terms!"

crm.72.t: "Russians Refuse!"
crm.72.d: "The Russian government has told us that our rights to the Sevastopol base and tax benefits violates Crimean independence and make them highly dependent on us. Obviously, we won't put us in a weaker position, but we can make concessions to Russians and allow them to gain profit from Crimea as well, in a lower proportion, of course."
crm.72.a: "Who are they to tell us what to do?"
crm.72.b: "We can accept their terms."

crm.73.t: "Germans Agree on Better Terms"
crm.73.d: "The German government has agreed to make the terms better for us and now suggests that our companies also can have tax benefits in the Crimea."
crm.73.a: "They still have access to Sevastopol. Leave the negotiations!"
crm.73.b: "That will be better for us, to be honest."

crm.74.t: "German Refuse Better Terms"
crm.74.d: "The German government has refused to make the terms better for us and told that we can leave the negotiations whenever we want now."
crm.74.a: "They will pay for it... later..."

crm.75.t: "Russians Leave the Negotiations!"
crm.75.d: "The Russian government has refused to sign the treaty and left the negotiations, abandoning poor Crimeans. That's what we wanted and now we can have profit alone."
crm.75.a: "Offer these terms to the Crimean government."

crm.78.a: "Green light for Ukraine!"

crm.79.t: "Green Light From Germany!"
crm.79.d: "The Crimean Republic has foolishly refused the Kaiser's terms. We have been given green light to go on with Crimean war, but it seems that our troops are now in a stalemate and we need more time."
crm.79.a: "Fools."

crm.80.t: "Crimean Republic Refused the Terms"

crm.105.b: "It's just a dirty piece of paper!"

crm.999.t: "Russians Can't Help Us!"
crm.999.d: "Despite their efforts, due to the Minsk Treaty, Germany has pressured Russia and it had to withdraw all its support for us and leave negotiations with Ukraine. It seems that now we are left alone!"
crm.999.a: "Russian betrayal!"

crm.1050.t: "Establish Crimean Directory"
crm.1050.d: "The War of Independence is over, and now it's time to sit down and focus on our internal affairs. The Extraordinary regional government of Krym wants to finally form a functioning, workable government for the next few years, but for this it is necessary to solve one main question - whether the already rather elderly Solomon should remain head of state, or resign, remembered by all Crimeans as a hero-liberator of Crimea from foreign influence, and appoint a younger, capable and energetic Crimean Tatar figure to the post of Prime-Minister of the Republic.\n\nThere are two candidates for the position of Solomon's successor. The first is Seidamet Jafer, an ideologue and one of the leaders of the Crimean Tatar people in the initial period of the Civil War, Minister of War and Minister of Foreign Affairs in the first government of the national hero of Crimea N. Celebijikhan and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Crimean regional government Sulkevich, until the resignation of the latter.\nThe second is Amet Ozenbashly, a candidate with a socialist bias in his views. He participated in the negotiations between the government of Sulkevich and the Hetman in 1918, and then did not emigrate and in 1920 became one of the founders of the agricultural organization "Shirket", which had branches in all regions of the Crimea and united members of the National Party. In addition, he became a member of the organization "Koch Yardim" ("Assistance to migrants"), which aimed to create favorable conditions for the return of Crimean Tatars from Turkey and the Bulgarian kingdom. Despite the fact that he stayed in Crimea after the occupation by Ukraine, it was only due to his patriotism and love for Crimea."
crm.1050.a: "There's life in the old dog yet!"
crm.1050.b: "Seidamet Jafer will be a good Prime-Minister."
crm.1050.c: "Crimea needs a more socialist-minded Prime-Minister."

crm.106.t: "The Flag For Our Nation"
crm.106.d: "Since the time of the first Crimean People's Republic, an ordinary light blue canvas has been considered the national flag, however, the Directory believes that it is necessary to give the main national symbol some special features.\n\nThe first option is to add a yellow tamga of the Giray dynasty to the upper left corner, referring us to our great past.\n\nThe second option is to add a yellow stripe in the middle so that yellow and light blue officially symbolize our Crimean Tatar identity."
crm.106.a: "First choice better represents us."
crm.106.b: "We are fine with the second choice."
crm.106.c: "Why do you think the Light Blue Banner is bad?"

crm.107.t: "Perekop Shaft"
crm.107.d: "We need to cross the Perekop Isthmus separating the peninsula from the mainland as soon as possible and break the separatist defenses. However, there is a possibility that this is exactly the tactical move they expect from us, and since Sevastopol is still under our control, there is a chance to hit them in the rear.\n\nIf we focus on attacking the Perekop Isthmus, there is a chance that the separatists will hold it with little blood, and the main forces will be thrown at Sevastopol to capture the Black Sea Fleet."
crm.107.a: "Try to invade Perekop."
crm.107.c: "Try to defend Sevastopol!"

crm.108.t: "Separatists Have Been Repulsed"
crm.108.d: "Our army reached the isthmus fairly quickly, but the separatist efforts to strengthen the defensive line meaningless, as were succfulyl striked south, pushing deeper into the mainland.\n\nAt the same time, we missed part of the Black Sea fleet, the main part of which managed to leave the Sevastopol Bay, and the other part defected to separatists, helping them to capture the city, and it seems that now we will not be able to recapture it. However, we have already seized Perekop and now we should decide if we should relocate our forces to the North and jointly attack Simferopol and Bakhchisarai, or try to recapture Sevastopol with parts of our fleet."
crm.108.a: "We must try to reinforce Sevastopol"
crm.108.b: "Strike Simferopol and Bakhchisarai with joint forces."

crm.109.t: "Sevastopol Defended!"
crm.109.d: "Due to the fact that we spent most of our forces on the defense of Sevastopol, we were able to successfully attack the separatists and keep the Black Sea fleet under our control.\n\nHowever, we paid the price, as separatists were able to break through the Perekop Isthmus and seize the initiative in the Taurida. Before it's too late, we need to strengthen our positions there and organize an effective defense against the separatists."
crm.109.a: "Reinforce Tauride as soon as possible!"
crm.109.b: "Capture Simferopol and Bakhchisarai before they are able to defend it."

crm.110.t: "Sevastopol Captured!"
crm.110.d: "We were unable to protect the key seaport of Sevastopol from the separatists, and soon the city fell under their onslaught. Having lost control of our last stronghold in Crimea, we can declare the victory of the separatists, no matter how bitter it may sound."
crm.110.a: "Victory of the separatists!"

crm.111.t: "Simferopol and Bakhchisarai Have Fallen"
crm.111.d: "We were able to outwit the separatists, and while they were trying to surround us, we attacked the almost unprotected Simferopol and Bakhchisarai, gaining a foothold in the cities and hanging out our flags there. Without these cities, the separatist uprising quickly turned into a guerrilla movement, which was also soon defeated. We won."
crm.111.a: "Victory of the Ukrainian Forces!"

crm.112.t: "Regaining Control Over the Black Sea Fleet Defectors"
crm.112.d: "We were able to negotiate with a part of the rebellious Black Sea fleet to submit back to us in exchange for amnesty. Despite the fact that they violated orders and defected to the separatists, their loyalty is now more important. The separatist uprising has been defeated and there is no need to punish the sailors."
crm.112.a: "Good that they still have honor"

crm.113.t: "Remnants of Separatists"
crm.113.d: "The remnants of the separatists transformed into a partisan movement, but that was until we discovered their headquarters and arrested every single one of the conspirators against Ukrainian statehood. Among those arrested were many Crimean Tatar intellectuals, who were placed in custody and taken out of Crimea. Soon, a trial of the separatists will take place in Kiev, where their fate will be decided."
crm.113.a: "Ukraine is united as never before."

crm.114.t: "Crimea Falls to Separatists!"
crm.114.d: "General Rogoza has failed in his attempt to restore control over the peninsula and now the Crimean Tatar separatists are controlling the whole Tauride Region. We must immediately think of our next strategy and probably get ready for a full-scale war of Crimean Reclamation."
crm.114.a: "Disaster!"

crm.115.t: "Blue And Yellow Over Crimea"
crm.115.d: "The Crimean rebellion was successfully suppressed, and separatist sentiments were destroyed. Thanks to the effective strategy of General Rogoza, we have successfully regained control over the entire peninsula. Yellow and blue flags are flying over Sevastopol and Simferopol again, a proud symbol of the independence of Ukrainians!"
crm.115.a: "Glad everything ended."

crm.116.t: "A New Flag?"
crm.116.d: "Together with proclamation of the Federation of Crimean Peoples we have adopted the new flag, but some of our politicians believe that we should adopt another version. Current flag uses the outline of the Crimean peninsula with four stars, representing four main nationalities of our country: Crimean Tatars, Russians, Ukrainians and Karaites. There are also two stripes: red in the upper part of the banner and yellow in the lower one.\n\nWe can adopt another flag, which will have only red stripes or another one, which will have only yellow stripes."
crm.116.a: "Current flag best represents our federation."
crm.116.b: "We should adopt the one with red stripes."
crm.116.c: "We should adopt the one with yellow stripes."

crm.117.t: "Crimea Needs Water!"
crm.117.d: "Since the independence of Crimea, it has been cut off from the mainland, and, accordingly, water. Since ancient times, Crimea has been a rather arid region, and now their government is faced with a serious shortage of water resources, which, according to the old project of H.H.Steven, they want to put on the peninsula by building the North Crimean Canal from the Dnieper.\n\nTo build this canal, they will need not only access to the Dnieper, but also that we will have to invest in this project and build our part of the canal on the territory of the Tauride District.\n\nTheir plan looks like complete madness, but the lack of water can turn into a major environmental and humanitarian disaster for Crimeans, among whom there are many Ukrainians."
crm.117.a: "Now they realize that they can't exist without us."
crm.117.b: "They should not have left us, to be fair."

crm.118.t: "Ukraine Agreed!"
crm.118.d: "The Ukrainian government, despite all our disagreements, has agreed to build the canal."
crm.118.a: "Glad we did this!"

crm.119.t: "Ukraine Refused!"
crm.119.d: "The bloodthirsty and merciless Ukrainian state has put its political hysteria above the health of millions of people! They refused to sign a contract with us on the construction of a vital canal!"
crm.119.a: "Call Berlin for assistance!"
crm.119.c: "They wanted all of us dead!"

Since ancient times, Crimea has been a rather arid region, and now their government is faced with a serious shortage of water resources, which, according to the old project of H.H.Steven, they want to put on the peninsula by building the North Crimean Canal from the Dnieper.\n\nTo build this canal, they will need not only access to the Dnieper, but also that we will have to invest in this project and build our part of the canal on the territory of the Tauride District.\n\nNow their government has turned to us, since Ukraine refused to help them in construction. We can put pressure on our allies and force them to build a canal, or, if they refuse, invest their funds to build a canal.
crm.120.a: "Demand they agree to build it!"
crm.120.b: "We will invest in building it!"
crm.120.c: "We don't care"

crm.121.t: "Germany Demands We Build the Canal!"
crm.121.d: "The German government demanded that we comply with the terms of the treaty recognizing Crimea as independent and help the peninsula get access to drinking water."
crm.121.a: "Say that this is not a political, but an economic issue."
crm.121.b: "Alright, let it be, we will still conquer Crimea later"

crm.122.t: "Ukraine Agreed!"
crm.122.d: "The Ukrainian government has given up and has agreed to build the canal."
crm.122.a: "Our geopolitical victory!"

crm.123.t: "Ukraine Refused!"
crm.123.d: "Ukraine refused to build the canal, telling us that this is an economic issue, not a political one."
crm.123.a: "Alright, we invest, but you'll pay us later!"

crm.124.t: "Germany Suggests Investments"
crm.124.d: "The Germans agreed to sponsor the canal construction. New German technic will sure build it more quickly, however, we have to pay them our debt in return."
crm.124.a: "They won't get money back without our agreement."
crm.124.b: "It seems we have nothing to do with this."

crm.125.t: "Ukraine Refused Again!"
crm.125.d: "Ukraine has once again refused, this time - to pay back their debt, because they had not agreed on the canal construction."

crm.144.t: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] [GetYear] Constitution"
crm.144.d: "When the first Crimean Republic adopted the constitution in 1917, it, of course, was largely incomplete and imperfect. Now that our independence is guaranteed, the Kurultai has gathered to draft a draft version of the new constitution in order to outline its main derivatives.\n\nFortunately, the government has already decided on both the foreign policy and the internal course that the free and independent Crimean state will follow, and therefore the basic political values, rights and obligations of citizens will be fixed today. In the future, amendments will be adopted to the current constitution, which will correct it and update it."
crm.144.a: "Great!"

crm.145.t: "The Krymkaraylar"
crm.145.d: "Our small, yet multinational country is a home not only to Orthodox Slavs and Muslim Crimean Tatars, but some other ethnicities as well, including the non-Rabbinic Judaism adherents, the Crimean Karaites, or Krymkaraylar, as they call themselves. Having a small minority in Poland and Lithuania as well, the Karaites are putting much effort into recreation of their culture and traditions, mainly thanks to Seraya Shapshal, the leader of European Karaite Society. With the Federation finally coming true, the question arose if the Karaites should be given greater autonomy and representation in the Qurultai."
crm.145.a: "Karaites should be equalized in every public sphere with other nations."
crm.145.b: "Let them stay a small, yet proud minority."

crm.146.t: "The Karaite Insurgency"
crm.146.d: "Almost immediately after the decision to make only one language the state language, a few but effective rallies of Karaites - the local Turkic-speaking population professing non-Rabbinic Judaism - began to take place throughout the peninsula. Their language is in many ways similar to Crimean Tatar and perhaps we should legitimize it, at least in schools in areas where the majority are Karaites."
crm.146.a: "Actually... Karaite language is almost similar to ours."
crm.146.b: "Our languages are similar, they will learn Qirimtatarca soon!"

crm.147.t: "Karaites Take Over!"
crm.147.d: "Our refusal to recognize the Crimean Karaite language, that is, to give at least some level of autonomy to the Karaites, led to the fact that their religious leader, Seraya Shapshal, was able to gather a protest rally of thousands in Bakhchisarai, which soon turned into armed clashes between our guard and the militia.\n\nIn the end, quite unexpectedly, Crimeans joined the Karaites, as well as many representatives of Slavic peoples, demanding the overthrow of our government. Despite the fact that we completely refused all the demands of the protesters, they were able to break into the Bakhchisarai Palace, where the Kurultai was sitting and arrest the Prime Minister.\n\nSeraya Shapshal announced the creation of the Crimean Karaite State and the assumption of the post of acting Prime Minister, as well as the delegation of broad powers to the interim government in the person of his inner circle from the 'Khazarian Revival Society'"
crm.147.a: "Glory days of our past will return!"

crm.148.t: "Slavic Workers Strike!"
crm.148.d: "Our measures on preferences for Tatar workers have not gone unnoticed. Already today, some factories have been closed due to strikes staged by Slavic workers demanding equal rights with Crimean Tatars. In addition to raising wages, they also require additional days off, which, in fact, Tatars need in connection with religious traditions. We can meet the demands of the workers so as not to aggravate the situation, or simply ignore their demands."
crm.148.b: "Ignore them."
crm.148.a: "Give up to their demands"

crm.149.t: "Crimean Soviet Republic!"
crm.149.d: "Our arrogance and disregard for the problems of the Russian- and Ukrainian-speaking working class led to the fact that soon most of the already few factories in our country stopped working. By uniting, Ukrainians and Russians were able to organize themselves into a certain mass, which demanded more and more.\n\nAt some point, a leader appeared among the strikers, who sharply won the sympathy of ordinary hard workers. This man turned out to be Dmitry Ilyich Ulyanov - the brother of Vladimir Lenin himself! It turned out that Dmitry has been living incognito in Crimea for a long time due to his great love for the local flora, fauna and climate. Now, having become the head of the uprising of the Crimean workers, he declared solidarity with all the Crimean peoples, because the nationalism of our government is just a relic of the bourgeois past.\n\nSoon, Bakhchisarai fell, then Simferopol, our government was arrested, and in its place the Council of Simferopol Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers' Deputies was formed, headed by Dmitry Ulyanov."

crm.152.a: "Let's begin."

crm.153.t: "The Decree on Peace"
crm.153.d: "The decree with which Lenin's path began was the decree on peace! It was an unprecedented symbol of his kindness and desire for peace and a quiet life for workers and peasants! He proclaimed the goal of the new government to renounce secret diplomacy and immediately conclude 'a just, democratic peace' 'without annexations and indemnities' by 'all warring nations and their governments', "Despite the fact that peace could not be achieved then, we can do it here and right now sign peace with all hostile countries.\n\nToday, by its decree, the Crimean Soviet authorities declared peace on the entire territory of the republic and the cessation of all hostilities, and also called on all other countries to do so."
crm.153.a: "We need peace on our Earth very much!"

crm.154.t: "The Decree on Land"
crm.154.d: "The most important decree adopted shortly after the revolution in October 1917 was the decree on land. We intend to repeat his points, and give all the land to the peasants!\n\n1) The landowner's ownership of land is immediately abolished without any redemption.\n2) The landlords' estates, as well as all the appanage, monastery, church lands with all their living and dead inventory, manor buildings and all accessories, are transferred to the disposal of the volost land Committees and county Councils of Peasant Deputies until the Constituent Assembly.\n3) Any damage to the confiscated property belonging to the whole people is now declared a grave crime punishable by a revolutionary court...\n4) To guide the implementation of the great land reforms, until their final decision, the Constituent Assembly should everywhere serve the following peasant mandate...\n5) The land of ordinary Cossacks and peasants is not confiscated."
crm.154.a: "No more landowners!"

crm.155.t: "Krymskaya Pravda"
crm.155.d: "In the grave decisive hour of the coup and the days immediately following it, the Provisional Revolutionary Committee was forced to take a number of measures against the counter-revolutionary press of various shades. Immediately, cries arose from all sides that the new socialist government had thus violated the basic principle of its program by encroaching on the freedom of the press.\nThe Workers' and Peasants' Government draws attention to the fact that in our society, behind this liberal screen, freedom for the propertied classes is actually hidden, having seized the lion's share of the entire press into their hands, it is not forbidden to poison the minds and bring confusion into the consciousness of the masses. Everyone knows that the bourgeois press is one of the powerful weapons of the bourgeoisie. Especially at critical moments, when the new power, the power of the workers and peasants, is only being consolidated, it was impossible to completely leave these weapons in the hands of the enemy at a time when they are no less dangerous at such moments than bombs and machine guns. That is why temporary and emergency measures were taken to curb the flow of dirt and slander, in which the yellow and green press would willingly drown the young victory of the people.\nAs soon as the new order is consolidated, all administrative influences on the press will be stopped, complete freedom will be established for it within the limits of responsibility before the court, according to the broadest and most progressive law in this regard. Taking into account, however, that the constraint of the press, even at critical moments, is permissible only within the limits absolutely necessary. The Council of People 's Commissars decides:\n\n1. Only press bodies are subject to closure:\n1) calling for open resistance or disobedience to the Workers' and Peasants' government;\n2) sowing confusion by clearly slanderous distortion of facts;\n3) calling for acts of a clearly criminal, i.e. criminally punishable nature.\n2. Press bans, temporary or permanent, are carried out only by resolution of the Council of People's Commissars.\n3. This provision is temporary and will be abolished by a special decree upon the onset of normal conditions of public life.\n\nChairman of the Council of People's Commissars\nDmitry Ulyanov (Lenin)"

The management of certain branches of state activity is entrusted to the commissions, whose members must ensure the implementation of the program announced by the Congress and work in close contact with mass organizations of men and women -workers, sailors, soldiers, peasants and employees. State power is vested in the collegium of the chairmen of these commissions, i.e. the Council of People's Commissars.\n\nControl over the activities of People's commissars with the right to replace them is entrusted to the All-Crimean Congress of Soviets of Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers' Deputies and its Central Executive Committee."

Your Soviets are from now on all-powerful and all-decisive organs of government. Rally around your Soviets. Strengthen them. Take matters into your hands and don't wait for anyone to tell you what to do. Insist on the strictest revolutionary order.\nOrganize strict control over production and accountability for the products. Bring before the revolutionary tribunal everyone who dares to harm the cause of the people by sabotaging (spoiling, hindering, destroying) in industry, concealing grain and produce, interfering with transportation of grain, tearing up rail, post, and telegraph lines, or in other ways opposing the great cause of peace, of transferring the land to the peasants, and of assuming workers' control over production and distribution.\nComrade workers, soldiers, peasants, and all toilers! Take all local power into your own hands. Take and guard as the apple of your eye the grain, factories, implements, products, and transport--all these are from now on wholly yours; they are public property.\nGradually, with the approval and agreement of the majority of the peasants, guided by their practical experience and that of the workers, we shall move on firmly and resolutely to the victory of socialism, a victory which the advance guard of the workers of the more civilized countries will make secure and which is bound to give the people a lasting peace and freedom from all oppression and exploitation.\n\nD.

However, since when the Crimea was annexed into Russia, the new theory has been developing not only in the hearts and souls of our people, but in the scientific circles as well. Today, with Seraya Shapshal's theory becoming more and more popular, we understand clearly our ancestry.\n\nWe are the descendants of the Khazars - a once-mighty group of Turkic Tatars that ruled a khanate that once spanned from Ukraine to Central Asia. Though our faith may be different and our traditions slightly altered, we are their descendants, and their glories as our glories. However, that also means the burden is now on us to untarnish their legacy and lead our shared Turkic race to glory.  We have much to do to revive the Khazaric traditions and finally get rid of any rabbinic influence that has been spreading into Crimea."
crm.160.a: "The truth has triumphed"

crm.161.t: "Shapshal's Doctrine of Dejudaization of Karaism"
crm.161.d: "Although we, the Karaites, and our religion are Jewish by faith, we are in no way ethnic Jews. We are not Ashkenazim or Sephardim, we are Turks, descendants of the Khazars!\n\nAccording to the doctrine of de-judicization of karaites by Seraya Shapshal, all the influence of Jewish ethnicity and non-Turkic culture should be eliminated from our religion and our identity so that we can be our own, unique and unsurpassed peoples. And despite the fact that this process may take a long time, we must begin the main transformations now - and the next generation of Karaites will never remember their false Jewish origin.\n\nAmong the main postulates of this doctrine, Shapshal singled out the following:\nKaraites are the indigenous ethnic group of the Crimea, which existed long before they adopted the teachings of Anan ben David.\nThe teachings of Anan ben David were close to early Christianity, and Jesus and Muhammad Karaites were considered prophets from time immemorial. The Karaites of Crimea adopted the law of Moses, but continued to adhere to ancient Turkic pagan beliefs."
crm.161.a: "Finally we have understood this."

crm.162.t: "Replacing the Names of Holidays and Months"
crm.162.d: "Within the framework of the doctrine of de-Judaization, it is necessary to Turkify the Karaite population, therefore Shapshal proposed to start by renaming traditional holidays from Hebrew roots to Turkic ones.\n\nFrom this day, the new names were adopted. 'Pesach' changes to Tymbyl Chydžy, 'the Post of the 9th Tammuz' - to Burunhu Oruč, 'Shavuot' - to Aftalar Chydzy, and others. Moreover, the new celebration was introduced in order to symbolize the beginning of the year - Jyl Bašy."
crm.162.a: "That will definetely spread Turkification policies!"

crm.163.t: "Our Bygone Religion"
crm.163.d: "One of the unique features of the doctrine of our great leader-reformer is the return of the great traditions of the pagan past of the Karaites-Khazars.\n\nThe relics of the archaic Karaite cults date back to paganism, shamanism, and Tengrianism. Although, according to Shapshal, "the Karaite clergy managed to transform the worldview of their co-religionists for a number of centuries," it is the ancient cults that are the original cultural heritage of the Crimean Karaites, requiring study, preservation and restoration. Among the native Karaite rituals to be restored: the cult of sacred oaks, ostrich eggs as a talisman and others.\n\nIn the near future, it is planned to restore the veneration of Sacred oaks, restore some pagan holidays and give them the features of traditional Karaite culture."
crm.163.a: "Interesting"

crm.164.t: "Militarization of Karaite History"
crm.164.d: "Militarization should occupy a significant place in Karaite history. Seraya Shapshal described in detail and stated the facts that the ancient Karaites were great warriors who served in the Polish-Lithuanian and Hetman army. Traces of the military history of the Karaites are reflected in the national symbols, including senek ('two-horned spear') and kalkan (shield).\n\nThe militarization of Karaite history also includes giving the theory of the great Karaite commander, Prince Elyaga Uzun official status, as well as the Karaite origin of the Pereyaslav colonel of the Zaporozhye Host, Ilyash Karaimovich.\n\nWith the publication of these facts, Seraya Shapshal hopes for the development of a sense of patriotism and nationality among our people and their readiness for a war for the revival of the great Khazaria."
crm.164.a: "We have always been warriors!"

crm.165.t: "Abolition of Hebrew Teaching in Schools"
crm.165.d: "Within the framework of the doctrine of de-Judaization of the Karaites, Seraya Shapshal abolished the teaching of Hebrew in schools, replacing it with the study of his native language - Crimean-Karaite. In addition, the Torah and other important documents were translated into the Karaite language, and the Karaite language became the official language in Crimea for political and public events, not counting events organized by other autonomies."
crm.165.a: "Speak Qirimkaraylar language!"

crm.166.t: "The Gakhan of the Khazaria"
crm.166.d: "The completion of the doctrine of de-Judaization of the Karaites was the official proclamation of the Seray Shapshal as the Gakhan of the Crimean Karaites and the new ruler of the Khazar Khaganate (Gakhanate).\n\nReplacing the word 'gakham' with the Turkic 'Gakhan', Shapshal seeks to emphasize the Turkic origin of the Karaites, because 'gakhan' etymologically comes from the Khazar 'kagan'. Despite the fact that Shapshal has long called himself Gakhan, today it was officially confirmed.\n\nIn addition, the Crimean state officially became known as the Khazar Khaganate, which allowed our leader to declare the revival of the great empire of the past."
crm.166.a: "The Khazaria has been revived!"

crm.167.t: "Legacy of Solomon Krym"
crm.167.d: "The national father of our independent Crimea, as well as a fellow Karaite, Solomon Krym, is perhaps the greatest modern figure of Crimea. He also sadly passed away, but this does not mean that his legacy should end there. Although he was not enthusiastic about our nationalist movement, the public does not need to know this. We will perceive Krym as the first Karaite hero of our time and a martyr, the herald of our new destiny. He will become a national hero of Crimea, and his image and legacy will become ideal tools that the state can use to win over the masses, because he was a man who united our people against foreign enemies and serious threats like no other."
crm.167.a: "The legacy of Solomon shall never perish!"

crm.168.t: "Denounce Rabbinic Judaism"
crm.168.d: "Although the Karaites technically descend from a rabbinic sect, we are in no way connected with their heretical ideas, despite our proximity to the Crimean Jews of Crimea. Although we would never harm our fellow Jews, we hereby officially condemn rabbinic Judaism and renounce any and all rabbinic ties, for our refined, purified and uniquely Turkic Karaite Judaism is the only true Jewish faith.\n\nOur proclamation has already become the object of fierce public discussion in Europe, especially among the Ashkenazi population, and many social movements demanded explanations from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which once again had to explain that there is nothing anti-Semitic or reprehensible in their actions, but only a statement of the fact of the Karaite past."
crm.168.a: "We determine our own destiny"

crm.169.t: "The Issue of Krymchaks"
crm.169.d: "Our fellow Crimeans profess Rabbinic Judaism, and in this regard, the question of their religious and national affiliation has become acute. Despite their small number (less than 1,000 people), the government proposes to create special conditions for the Crimeans so that they can preserve their national, ethnic and religious affiliation in the conditions of the new Kaganate. We can grant them autonomy and the opportunity to live according to their traditional customs, or simply leave everything as it is, which may lead to the speedy extinction of their people or assimilation."
crm.169.a: "We shall grant them autonomy."
crm.169.b: "Everything shall stay as it is."

crm.170.t: "[FROM.GetName] Funds Karaite Minority"
crm.170.d: "Since ancient times, a large Tatar diaspora has lived in Lithuania, professing Karaism and coming from the lands of the Crimea. Now that the Karaites have become dominant on their territory and announced the creation of a new Khazar Khaganate, we learned that they actively sponsor the Karaite Lithuanian communities. Despite the fact that these actions are aimed at supporting the Karaite people, and are not aimed at any military and separatist sentiments, we can cut off these ties for our security."
crm.170.a: "Stop their funding!"
crm.170.b: "Perhaps, this will do no harm to us"

crm.171.t: "True Ashkenazi Origins"
crm.171.d: "Today we have become the object of state propaganda of the Khazar Khaganate, which began to distribute mainly among the numerous Ashkenazi population an article about the true origin of the Ashkenazim.\n\nTheir theory postulated that Ashkenazi Jews were primarily, or to a large extent, descended from Khazars, a multi-ethnic conglomerate of mostly Turkish people who formed a semi-nomadic khanate in and around the northern and central Caucasus and the Pontic–Caspian steppe.\n\nOf course, we understand that their propaganda is undoubtedly aimed at attracting our Jewish population to new lands in the Crimea, and we need to attract experts as soon as possible and publish official statements about the failure of their theory."
crm.171.a: "Madness!"

crm.172.t: "True Cossack Origins"
crm.172.d: "The Khazar Khaganate began to spread propaganda among our population about the true origin of the Cossacks. According to their theory, the origin of the Cossacks is exclusively Khazar, and that the Khazars were also a Slavic people. Despite the inconsistency of this theory, it began to gain popularity among our population and even gave rise to slogans about unification with the Khazar Khaganate.\n\nWe must officially renounce this theory or leave everything as it is, hoping for the consciousness of our people."
crm.172.a: "Madness!"
crm.172.b: "Let people believe in what they want"

crm.173.t: "Khazaria Requests Our Support"
crm.173.d: "We received an appeal for help from the Khazar Khaganate, which began its armament against the Ottoman Empire in order to regain its ancestral territories. We can help them and sponsor their movement, or we can refuse."

crm.179.d: "With our capital falling to the revived Kaganate, we should immediately sign peace, as we have no other choice."
crm.179.a: "We lost Livoberezhye!"

crm.180.t: "Solomon Krym Passes Away!"
crm.180.d: "The name of the great figure of the Crimean Tatar people, Solomon Krym, will forever remain in history. Prime Minister in exile from 1919 to 1936, he contributed in every possible way to the development of Crimean Tatar statehood as part of Ukraine, and then became the leader of the national liberation movement. Today Solomon has left us, at an advanced age, but his memory will live forever."
crm.180.a: "Our national hero!"

crm.181.t: "Crimea Secures Independence"
crm.181.d: "Fighting back against Ukrainian defense forces and internal ethnic violence, the diverse seperatist groups of Crimea have held their ground, and after much blood was spilled on the Perekop Isthmus, an independent Crimea now stands alone. Not since Russia consumed the peninsula in 1783, breaking the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca after decades of tense relations and conflicts with the Ottomans, has Crimea been free, and now with the myriad peoples of the peninsula all breathing free air, the future of Crimea has never been more wide-open. As the newly independent state now settles its new foundations, the world looks to this small but vital hold on the Black Sea with curious eyes, for the people of Crimea claim to have big plans - even while the Ukrainians, Russians, and other opportunistic forces already begin to circle Crimea like hungry wolves."
crm.181.a: "The Black Sea just got a whole lot more interesting."

crm.182.t: "The Crimean Khanate Rises Once More"
crm.182.d: "Once known to the wider world as ‘Little Tartary,’ the Crimean Khanate has risen once again. Finally snuffed from existence in 1783 after the Russians marched into the peninsula and took Crimea for themselves, the Khanate stood for over 300 years before that with the aid of their Ottoman allies. As if history was destined to repeat itself, the Ottomans once again moved to tie themselves to the newly independent Crimea, and now, as if it were 1441, the Great Horde and Desht-i Kipchak rises again from the ashes of their old civilization. With the Khanate restored, the Crimeans have reaffirmed their centuries-old alliance with the Sultan of Islambol, and now together they seek to lead the Crimean Tatars to greatness."
crm.182.a: "From out of the pages of history and onto the Black Sea coast."

crm.183.t: "Lenin...Lives?!"
crm.183.d: "As if it were 1917 all over again, an Ulyanov has risen to lead the Russian Proletariat, but this time not from inside the center of the Russian Empire. Instead, it would seem that the newly independent state of Crimea has become the new heart of Bolshevik fervor, and a new vanguard of the Proletariat has risen to fill the shoes of the late Vladimir Lennin - and who better to take his place than his own brother! Standing as the new Premier of the Crimean Soviet Republic, Dmitri Ilyich Ulyanov - the younger brother to Vladamir Ilyich Ulyanov ‘Lenin’ - has announced his plans to restart the Russian Revolution, finishing what his beloved brother could not. Issuing the Great Decrees once more and rallying the disparate Crimeans to his side, many call Dmitri a madman grasping at old glories, but perhaps this aging revolutionary is the second-coming the Bolsheviks truly need. Nothing is for certain, though the world’s eyes are now glued to this tiny peninsula to see what transpires next."
crm.183.a: "The Bolshevik Revolution lives on?"

crm.184.t: "The Rebirth of Khazaria"
crm.184.d: "Rising from the ashes like a phoenix reborn, the Khazar Khaganate stands anew on the Crimean Peninsula, ready to spread the one, true faith of Karaite Judaism to the old lands of Khazaria. Casting off their Rabbinic heritage and the Zionist notions of their distant relatives the Asheknazi, the Karaites have embraced their ‘true’ heritage has children of the Khazars, and now seek to restore the old khaganate to its former glories while united under the Karaite faith. Though many have called them zealots and heretics driven on by dubious historical accounts and false delusions of grandeur, the Karaites stand proud and poised to retake the lands of their supposed ancestors. For now, however, the world shall watch and wait to see what these strange Jews do next."
crm.184.a: "An old idea bonded by a new faith, surrounded by enemies on all sides."

crm.200.t: "Peace with [FROM.GetName]?"
crm.200.d: "Despite its size, the [FROM.GetAdjective] army proved to be strong and desperate in its attack. Perhaps we should give up the territories they claim and sign the peace?"

Our leader has risen to take this title as his own, rising to become Gakhan Shapshal of the new Khazar Khaganate. Under his illustrious and stalwart leadership, the Karaites shall reach their destiny as the heirs to Khazaria."

CRM_Militarization_Of_Karaite_Reality: "Militarization of Karaite Reality"
CRM_Militarization_Of_Karaite_Reality_desc: "With our history repainted in a martial hue, it is now time to reflect that history in our current reality. We must modernize and militarize the nation and the industry behind it so that we can be prepared for any foe as we rise to reclaim the legacy of our ancestors. With new factories, new conscripts, and new weapons of war, we shall seize our destiny by force."

CRM_Make_An_Example_Of_Solomon_Krym: "Honor the ‘Real’ Solomon Krym"
CRM_Make_An_Example_Of_Solomon_Krym_desc: "The national father of our independent Crimea and a fellow Karaite as well, Solomon Krym is perhaps Crimea’s greatest contemporary figure. He is also sadly deceased, but that does not mean his legacy must end there. Though he was not fond of our nationalist movement, the public does not need to know that. We shall raise Krym as the first Karaite hero of the modern age and the martyred herald of our new destiny. He will become Crimea’s own national hero and his image and legacy will be perfect tools to utilize by the state to win over the masses, for he was the man who united our people against foreign foes and grave threats like none other."

CRM_Reject_Semitic_Origins: "Reject Semitic Origins"
CRM_Reject_Semitic_Origins_desc: "We are no sons of David or Abarham, for we are the sons of the Turkic Khans! Though we are devout in our Jewish faith, we have no links of blood or culture to the Semite and their widespread diaspora. Unlike these failed children of God, we shall reclaim our homeland and march to our destiny free of their disgraces as the true heirs to the Turkic Khazars."

CRM_Request_Entente_Economic_Support: "Request Entente Economic Support"
CRM_Request_Entente_Economic_Support_desc: "The Entente are our national allies in the coming struggle. We should reach out to their bloc and begin economic talks so that we can march into a prosperous and profitable future."

CRM_Join_The_IEDC: "Join the ISAC"
CRM_Join_The_IEDC_desc: "In order to deepen our ties with the Entente even further, we shall join their international science commission. Together, we shall coordinate and cooperate in order to foster closer relations and scientific advances for the good of the entire alliance."

CRM_Treaty_With_Egypt: "A Treaty with Egypt"
CRM_Treaty_With_Egypt_desc: "With our preparations for war slowly crescendoing to a showdown with the old Sublime Porte, it would be wise to establish diplomatic ties with Egypt. Through a new secret treaty, we shall affirm the cooperation between our two nations as we both prepare to bring down the hedonistic land of the Ottomans."

CRM_Organize_Weapons_Shipments: "Organize Weapons Shipments"
CRM_Organize_Weapons_Shipments_desc: "To fight the coming war, we will need every firearm and weapon of war we can muster. We must reach out to the international market, whether it be the White market or the Black, in order to requisition the gun shipments we will need to arm our military in full."

CRM_Denounce_Rabbinists: "Denounce Rabbinic Judaism"
CRM_Denounce_Rabbinists_desc: "Though the Karaites are technically derived from the Rabbinic sect, we are in no way linked to their heretical ideas despite our close proximity to the Krymchak Jews of Crimea. Though we would never bring harm to our fellow Jewish brethren, we hereby formally denounce Rabbinic Judaism and renounce any and all Rabbinic ties, for our refined, purified, and uniquely Turkic Karaite Judaism is the one, true Jewish faith."

CRM_Establish_Ties_With_Lithuanian_Karaites: "Establish Ties with Lithuanian Karaites"
CRM_Establish_Ties_With_Lithuanian_Karaites_desc: "Lithuania holds a small but vibrant population of fellow Karaites who emigrated there decades ago after a series of repressions done by the old Russian Empire. We should reach out to these distant kin and establish close ties with their community and businesses, fostering unity between all Karaites. Though they may be far from Crimea, they can still help our rising state prosper."

CRM_Spread_The_Khazar_Myth: "Spread the Truth of the Khazar Myth"
CRM_Spread_The_Khazar_Myth_desc: "The Khazar hypotheses for Ashkenazi and Cossack ancestry, called the Khazar Myth by its foolish detractors, states that both the Cossacks and the Askenazi Jews are descended from the Khazars, and as such, most European Jews and Cossacks are of our blood. Seraya Shapshal is a close adherent to this theory, and one of its loudest proponents. By his word, the so-called ‘Khazar Myth’ shall be revealed to be what it truly always has been - nothing but the truth!"

CRM_Revive_Khazar_Traditions: "Revive the Culture and Traditions of Khazaria"
CRM_Revive_Khazar_Traditions_desc: "The traditions and culture of Khazari must be revitalized to become the bedrock of our new khaganate. Though they have faded into the pages of history, we shall not let the noble great horde be forgotten, for it is our duty as their heirs to ensure that their memory and customs live on in perpetuity. Their culture shall become our culture, modified and modernized to fit the needs of our state."

CRM_Restoring_Our_Legacy: "Restoring Our Legacy"
CRM_Restoring_Our_Legacy_desc: "The time to cast off our shackles shall soon be upon us, for the time to restore the legacy of the Khazar Khanate is near. We will soon march into our bright new future under Gakhan Shapshal and bring honor and prosperity to the Karaites like never before. Let us charge into our destiny and restore our khaganate from the sands of time!"

CRM_Preemptive_Srike_On_Ukrainians: "Preemptive Strike on the Ukrainians"
CRM_Preemptive_Srike_On_Ukrainians_desc: "The Ukranians have been plotting their revenge since the moment we declared an independent Crimea. We must strike them before they strike us, for only through the element of surprise will we succeed. To war, and to Kiev!"

CRM_Bring_Cossacks_Into_The_Fold: "Bring Cossacks Into the Fold"
CRM_Bring_Cossacks_Into_The_Fold_desc: "The Don and Kuban Cossacks lie open and unsuspecting to our greater ambitions. There they sit, across the thinnest point of the Black Sea just East of the Kerch Strait, just ready for the taking. We shall march to Yekaterinodar and beyond, seizing the lands of the Northern Caucasus and beyond before we strike Russia."

CRM_Restore_Volga_Bulgaria: "Restore Volga Bulgaria"
CRM_Restore_Volga_Bulgaria_desc: "To the North, Russia lords over the Volga Bulgars - our linguistic and ethnic brethren. We will march into the icy lands of the Northern Bear and liberate these fellow Turkics, recreating the once-noble Volga Bulgaria as a buffer state between our borders and the wilds of Russian Asia and wider Europe."

CRM_Third_Arab_Khazar_War: "Third Arab-Khazar War"
CRM_Third_Arab_Khazar_War_desc: "Despite its confusing name, the third Arab-Khazar war is firstly named as such because of the previous two wars, fought more than a thousand years ago between Khazars and Khalifates of the Middle East, that precede it and secondly in order to stoke up more patriotic fervor with the masses by pulling on age-old grudges. Though it is not exactly the same foe, we are once again fighting against another powerful Muslim country - the Ottoman Empire! Now let us march to Istanbul and burn it to the ground!"

CRM_Pax_Khazarica: "PAX CHAZARICA"
CRM_Pax_Khazarica_desc: "Under our noble and pious hand, the lands of the Khazar Khaganate have been united under our regime. We are the heirs of Khazaria and the greatest, most noble practitioners of the Jewish faith on Earth. By casting off the last shreds of Rabbinic influence and uplifting our Turkic legacy, we have brought honor and prosperity to the Karaite people at last. An unprecedented era of peace has begun under the rule of Gakhan Shapshal, and now under his guidance we shall march proudly into our new golden age."


### Ideas ###
CRM_water_shortage: "Water Shortage"
CRM_water_shortage_desc: "The shortage of fresh water has existed on the peninsula at all times. The main reasons are considered to be arid climate and karst rocks. The problem was partially solved when, in 1931, the Bakhchisarai reservoir was built on the Egiz-Oba beam, filled with Kacha waters. However, the growth of the urban population complicates this problem. If we fail to solve it as the peninsula industrializes, we may face serious consequences."
CRM_water_shortage_tt: "§RWe will face a serious humanitarian and environmental disaster if we don't deal with water shortage timely§!"

CRM_severe_water_shortage: "Severe Water Shortage"
CRM_severe_water_shortage_desc: "We have exceeded the reserves of fresh water sufficient for the viability of the peninsula, and now we are facing serious problems with water scarcity. If we do not find water sources for our population in the near future, we will face a serious humanitarian and environmental disaster"

CRM_local_revolt: "Local Uprisings"
CRM_local_revolt_desc: "The local indigenous population of the Crimean Tatars began a large-scale agitation against our regime. And although their leadership, the so-called Crimean Tatar Kurultai, does not call for active protest actions, the local population is still dissatisfied. Minor uprisings are breaking out all over the peninsula, preventing us from effectively pursuing policy."

CRM_ukrainian_ascendancy: "Ukrainian Ascendancy"
CRM_ukrainian_ascendancy_desc: "The Ukrainians have been ruling over Crimea for too long, it is time to fight for its independence."

CRM_ever_present_russians: "Ever-present Russians"
CRM_ever_present_russians_desc: "Almost 40% of the peninsula's population consider themselves Russians. Russian Russians, unlike the rest of Ukraine, the situation here is particularly acute, since the Russian population here is an absolute majority, both in comparison with Ukrainians and in comparison with Russians. The policy of Ukrainization carried out over the past 15 years has only worsened the situation, and we have to constantly make concessions to the Russians. However, surrounded on all sides by anti-Russian countries and the sea, perhaps no one will save them in time."

CRM_khazar_revival_society: "Krymkaraylar Influence"
CRM_khazar_revival_society_desc: "Seraya Shapshal, or, as he is called, His Excellency Hajji Seraya Khan Shapshal, is a spiritual leader of the Tatar Karaims, a Jewish religious movement. Since 1911 he has been the hakham of the Tauride and Odessa Karaite spiritual board and under his patronage the Jewish rights of Crimeans were respected. The Hetman's rule changed everything, when the policy of Ukrainisation, even if it was not as harsh as Shapshal imagined, made him openly speak against King, criticize Hetman and start public discussion about Jewish autonomy in the Crimea. He is not as simple as he seems, and in the future he can become a serious problem."

CRM_khazar_revival_society_1: "Khazar Revival Society"
CRM_khazar_revival_society_1_desc: "With our republic finally becoming independent from the Ukraine, the Karaite influence and Shapshal's authority has grown a lot. In fact, to the extent where he proclaimed the restoration of Khazar Khaganate under his rule. This is a pure nonsense, but such influential person as Shapshal can turn the Jewish population against us."

CRM_khazar_revival_society_2: "Dreams of Khazar Khaganate"
CRM_khazar_revival_society_2_desc: "The Khazar Revival Society under His Excellency Hajji Seraya Khan Shapshal have seized power in Crimea, efficiently removing all non-Jewish from official positions. The dream of restoring the Khazar Khaganate is still in the air, and the desire of our nation to fight for it has grown as well."

CRM_crimean_tatar_rule: "Krymtatarlar!"
CRM_crimean_tatar_rule_desc: "After decades of humiliation, the Crimean Tatars were finally able to take power on the peninsula into their own hands. Now, the new government of the republic must choose a new path for Crimea."

CRM_multinational_federation: "Multinational Federation"
CRM_multinational_federation_desc: "The Government of the Crimean People's Republic has set a course to create comfortable conditions on the peninsula for all its inhabitants, guaranteeing equal rights to all nations inhabiting Crimea. On the way to a multinational federation, we have to make concessions, but this definitely guarantees peace and prosperity for our region."

CRM_crimea_for_crimeans: "Crimea For The Crimeans!"
CRM_crimea_for_crimeans_desc: "The Government of the Crimean People's Republic has embarked on the Ukrainization and de-Russification of the peninsula. For many years, the Crimean Tatars were humiliated and practically destroyed by a foreign culture planted from the outside. It is time to regain the right to vote, the right of self-determination and the right to speak Crimean Tatar."

CRM_german_treaty: "Treaty with Germany"
CRM_german_treaty_desc: "The treaty signed at Berlin, though deepened our dependence on Germany, has also given us peace and independence from Ukraine."

CRM_kiev_treaty: "Treaty with Germany and Russia"
