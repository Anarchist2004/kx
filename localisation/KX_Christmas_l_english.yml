chr.1.t: "The Year Without a Christmas"
chr.1.d: "Less than a week ago, on December 25th, 1935, children all across the world awoke to what should have been a happy, wholesome day of fun, peace, love, and merry-making. Instead however, children all around the globe woke not to presents, not to filled socks, but to nothing. Cookies and Milk that had been left out for Santa Claus went uneaten, and that holiday spirit and joy was replaced by anger and depression. This shock has not been felt just by kids, but parents as well, and many parent groups have begun to pressure the government to act, and try and find out just what happened to Ol' Saint Nick. While obviously being little more than a headache, parent groups have almost no say within the halls of power anyway, many are wondering if we should simply give in to just stop the noise. Others, ardent believers in Santa themselves, are pushing hard for us to investigate the happenings in the North Pole, fearing that something must have happened to Santa that led to Christmas being cancelled. Regardless of what we do, the world has gone it's first year without a Christmas, and unless something changes, it seems that Christmas as we knew it may be over forever..." 
chr.1.a: "Bah Humbug! Santa isn't even real!" 
chr.1.b: "Send a team to the North Pole, just to be safe." 
chr.1.c: "This is urgent! Use everything at our disposal to fix this! (Play as Santa's Workshop)"


chr.2.t: "The Workshop into 1936"
chr.2.d: "Santa is missing, and chaos reigns across the North Pole. What should be a time of joy and a time for cheer is now naught but ash and cinders. The elves have unionized and risen as one united front - the Elfletariat - under Comrade Mariah Carey, and seek to bring epic and totalized Communism to these frozen wastes. The false Toy Santa and his army of giant nutcrackers under the Toyist Clique sit in exile, ready to seize the chance to reclaim the Workshop and to bring coal to all children. The various reindeer, snowmen - both hatted and abominable, and other beasts of this frozen land are running amuck and feral, and the Grinch sits high on his mountaintop looking down upon the chaos with hungry and greedy eyes. The last grouping of Santa Loyalists are rallied around the crumbling authority of Mrs. Claus, and unless Santa is found soon, all will be lost."
chr.2.a: "Merry Christmas to all?"

chr.3.t: "The Hunt for Santa"
chr.3.d: "The time has come - we must finally embark to sweep the magical realm in order to find Santa. We must now decide who we shall turn to in order to find help in this quest, but must be wary as we may be beholden to whomever we choose."
chr.3.a: "Seek help from the elemental Miser Brothers."
chr.3.b: "Join in with the Toy Loyalists led by the impostor Toy Santa."
chr.3.c: "We will find Santa ourselves!"

chr.4.t: "They're Too Much!"
chr.4.d: "Despite our hope and goodwill, the Miser Brothers have taken advantage of our weak position, and have couped Ms. Claus! Now, the brothers of ice and fire battle it out within the Workshop, with the fate of the North Pole and the wider world all hanging in the balance. As the fighting rages and the forces of Winter and Summer battle it out for good, who rises above the other victorious as the frost and flames settle."
chr.4.a: "Mr. White Christmas himself, the Snow Miser, freezes his brother solid."
chr.4.b: "Mr. Green Christmas himself, the Heat Miser, melts his brother into a puddle."

chr.5.t: "Toy Santa's Return"
chr.5.d: "Despite our hope and goodwill, the Long exiled Toyist Clique betrayed us on the hunt for Santa, and now move to secure the Workshop for themselves as they topple Mrs. Claus’ regime. However, the striking elves under Comrade Carey refuse to work for this coal-slinging slaver, and the Elfletariat has declared a full-blown Revolution! As nutcrackers fight elves in the streets and forges across the North Pole, the fate of Santa’s Workshop dangles in the balance."
chr.5.a: "Toy Santa and the Toyists crush the Elfletariat. The Age of Coal shall begin!"
chr.5.b: "Comrade Carey and the Elfletariat’s revolution succeed! A Red Christmas shall rise for all!"


chr.6.t: "The Grinch Extends A Green Hand in Aid"
chr.6.d: "Working by ourselves to find Santa has proved fruitless so far, but we did find someone willing to help out in these frozen wastes. Passing by the quaint little town of Whoville, we happened upon an odd, green, and furry being who smelled something foul. Calling himself the Grinch, he has offered a hand in helping us find Santa. However, many within our party are wary of such an offer. What should we do?"
chr.6.a: "I wouldn’t touch him with a 39-and-a-half foot pole!"
chr.6.b: "What’s the worst that could happen? Accept his offer!"

chr.7.t: "Santa is Found!"
chr.7.d: "Praise all the gods of Winter, old and new! We have found Santa at last! It turns out he was imprisoned by his evil doppelganger Toy Santa, who had kept him right under our noses as he planned to take over the Workshop. With Santa finally returned to us, Christmas is saved at last!"
chr.7.a: "Santa Claus is coming to town!"

chr.8.t: "The Grinch Marches on the Workshop"
chr.8.d: "We shouldn’t have trusted that foul and despicable beast! The Grinch led our search party astray in the frozen wastes and seized the Workshop for himself! Santa is missing and the Grinch has stolen Christmas, and now the North is his to do with as he pleases."
chr.8.a: "You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch!"

chr.9.t: "The Death of Santa"
chr.9.d: "After much searching and preparation, the vile Saint Nick has at last been found. As it turns out, Santa had crashed just after takeoff on Christmas Eve, 1935. The Fat Man of the North than wondered in seemingly all directions, clueless as to where he was, and it was in this state of cluelessness that he had been found in.  At least that is the official story that our government is telling the people of the Workshop. In reality, Toy Santa had captured Santa in a daring raid. Up until this day, Santa had been kept neatly in Toy Santa's Fortress. Regardless, with the real Santa being 'found' at last, the time has come to do what must be done. Santa is to be executed by fire squad in the morning for his crimes against the Workshop. While few expected us to take such a radical action, due to the sheer amount of Santa supporters that still hide among us, his death shall serve as an example. With his death, the final preparation will be completed, and soon we can show the world just what has become of the Workshop. "
chr.9.a: "Santa's reign is over, at last."

CHR_christmas_party_desc: "Comrade Carey makes a lot of references to a wider ‘Party’ that binds us, but until now, no such formal organization existed, for our uprising was so ramshackle and grassroots-orientated that no formal all-encompassing organizational body ever naturally coalesced until her rise. To remedy this, a new Christmas Party shall be organized, binding all loyal citizens of the state and of the Elfletariat together under Comrade Carey and the arms of the revolutionary regime. Together, we shall reach a red and frosty Utopia."
CHR_the_red_noise: "Rudolph the Truly Red"
CHR_the_red_noise_desc: "Reindeer have long served Santa Claus and his forces - majestic cervids with great intelligence and the amazing ability to fly used as nothing more than slave-beasts for that foolish old ‘Saint.’ Rallying and rebranding their breed behind the mutant freak Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer - whose nose is a naturally-occuring Syndicalist symbol ordained by God or some Winter deity or by some aberration of a natural process - we shall utilize these amazing animals to fit the needs of the state and the Christmas Party."
CHR_peoples_workshop: "We Hear Those Sleigh Bells Jingling"
CHR_peoples_workshop_desc: "We hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring ting tingling too. Come on, it's lovely weather for a Revolution together with you. Outside the snow is falling and Elves are calling ‘Yoo-hoo!’ Come on, it's lovely weather for a Syndicalist Utopia with you! \nUnder Comrade Carey, the North Pole has been bathed in Red - both of the blood of our enemies and the Red of both Christmas and Syndicalism. Now, we must gather our strength and lick the wounds wrought by out growing pains, for the world calls for a Red Christmas for all!"

CHR_kill_santa: "The Cause of Claus' Death"
CHR_kill_santa_desc: "To out great luck, we have found the real, and once lost, Santa Claus. Fitting of a man of his status and fame, we shall put the execution of this fat fool on display, for all the world to see. We will show all that this Saint Nick isn’t so saintly, especially when his head rolls across the floor!"
CHR_coal_for_all: "Mangle it in Tangled-Up Knots"
CHR_coal_for_all_desc: "Everyone else in the world has been very, very naughty, for the list has been checked not once but twice, and not a single soul was found to be nice. All the world deserves nothing but coal, so let it snow, let it snow, let it snow nothing but black, black coal."
CHR_world_revolution: "Hail The New, Ye Lads and Lasses"
CHR_world_revolution_desc: "Hail the New, ye lads and lasses - the new Syndicalist Utopia! Comrade Carey and the Elfletariat ride South from their icy Red hold in the North Pole to spread the crimson light of Comunist glory to all the good girls and boys of the world. You better watch out, you better not cry, for the Revolution is coming to town!"

CHR_grinch: "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"
CHR_grinch_desc: "Raging against the regime of the false Santa and the idea of Christmas itself, the infamous Grinch has seized control of the North. Cuddly like a cactus and charming as an eel, this nefarious and malevolent manifestation of the Anti-Christmas shall ensure that the holiday season ceases to exist at all."
CHR_the_empty_hole: "Your Heart's an Empty Hole"
CHR_the_empty_hole_desc: "Humans are a void, and the Grinch is the embodiment of the emptiness. Humanity has thrown away all the good in the world in the search of self-gain, satisfaction, and material wealth - the very antithesis of the true holiday spirit. The mistakes of humanity shall be corrected - their hearts made from empty holes and garlic souls to true and wholesome and pure - and all that cannot be saved shall be eradicated."
CHR_stink_stank_stunk: "Stink, Stank, Stunk!"
CHR_stink_stank_stunk_desc: "The stink, stank, stunk of humanity is as revolting as the yellow teeth and unkempt green fur of their vile avatar. The Grinch is the icon of this disgust and pestilence - a herald of their decaying sin and rotting ambition. By the Grinch’s hand, these maladies will be wiped clean and expunged, totally."
CHR_mangle_gifts_with_tangled_up_knots: "The Grinchy Claus"
CHR_mangle_gifts_with_tangled_up_knots_desc: "In a masquerade bordering on plain mockery, the Grinch has decided to don the outfit of the true Santa Claus, with his beloved and berated dog Max following suit by wearing a reindeer antler in solidarity. Dressing in the big, red suit and cap, the Grinch shall become a shadowy and sinful mirror of the old Saint Nick, for he is gone, and the Grinch is the new lord of winter and Christmas from now on."
CHR_distasteful_assortment_of_deplorable_rubbish_imaginable: "Overflowing with Deplorable Rubbish"
CHR_distasteful_assortment_of_deplorable_rubbish_imaginable_desc: "Waste, greed, decadence, hedonism. These sins plague Humanity and the wider world, rotting our society to the very core atop a mountain of waste and hollow want. Like a dead tomato splotched with moldy purple spots, the world is nothing but decay and disease - a mess that must be cleaned completely if the Grinch’s new world order is to flourish."
CHR_seasick_crocodiles: "The Tender Sweetness of a Seasick Crocodile"
CHR_seasick_crocodiles_desc: "Given a choice between the wasteful sinners of this world and a ravenous seasick crocodile, a sane man would pick the croc every time. There is no saving Humanity, for their heart is full of unwashed socks and their soul is full of gunk like their avatar Mr. Grinch. There is no saving this dreadful, reptilian lot."
CHR_three_decker_sauerkraut_toadstool: "Topped with Arsenic Sauce"
CHR_three_decker_sauerkraut_toadstool_desc: "The fools that still celebrate this false holiday of greed and selfish desire still go on, enjoying their fattening feasts like suckling pigs. However, like suckling pigs, they are also ripe for slaughter! We shall poison every Christmas and holiday feast on Earth, for the world will come to hate this holiday one way or another!"
CHR_maybe_christmas_means_a_bit_more: "Maybe... Christmas Means Just a Bit More."
CHR_maybe_christmas_means_a_bit_more_desc: "After interrupting a feast that was in progress and being invited to dine with the townspeople, Mr. Grinch has seen the light and has  since reversed course entirely. Rising to become the saviour and herald of Christmas, the Grinch has saved the holiday season for all! They say that the Grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day, and though this may be the sign of an underlying health condition, the world is all the better for it. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"
CHR_youre_a_mean_one: "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"
CHR_youre_a_mean_one_desc: "The Grinch now stands poised to topple the world order, bringing ruin to Christmas for all eternity. The people chant his name and sing his song, for they know their final doom approaches. All shall perish, and all shall fall, for the Grinch is coming for them all! \n’You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch. You really are a heel. You're as cuddly as a cactus, you're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch. You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel!’"
