All those found guilty of betraying the Revolution of the Elfletariat shall be melted down in the reject-toy smeltery.

A nationalized and planned gift-making economy shall be formed, with all ownership being collectively shared by all Elfkind, but administered and overseen by the Party and by Comrade Carey directly, so that true Syndicalist Utopia and economic prosperity can be achieved for the people of the North Pole."
CHR_christmas_party:0 "Formalize the 'Christmas' Party"
CHR_christmas_party_desc:0 "Comrade Carey makes a lot of references to a wider ‘Party’ that binds us, but until now, no such formal organization existed, for our uprising was so ramshackle and grassroots-orientated that no formal all-encompassing organizational body ever naturally coalesced until her rise. To remedy this, a new Christmas Party shall be organized, binding all loyal citizens of the state and of the Elfletariat together under Comrade Carey and the arms of the revolutionary regime. Together, we shall reach a red and frosty Utopia."
CHR_the_red_noise:0 "Rudolph the Truly Red"
CHR_the_red_noise_desc:0 "Reindeer have long served Santa Claus and his forces - majestic cervids with great intelligence and the amazing ability to fly used as nothing more than slave-beasts for that foolish old ‘Saint.’ Rallying and rebranding their breed behind the mutant freak Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer - whose nose is a naturally-occuring Syndicalist symbol ordained by God or some Winter deity or by some aberration of a natural process - we shall utilize these amazing animals to fit the needs of the state and the Christmas Party."
