GEX.5.d:0 "It appears we need to deal with the continuing war in the Far East, with [SIA.GetAdjective] armies still fighting against our colonial forces in [GEA.GetNameDef]. Should we continue the war, one we almost certainly cannot hope to have much impact on with our scattered and beaten forces, or sue for peace?"
GEX.5.a:0 "Give them whatever they want."
GEX.5.b:0 "We will continue the war, if we must."

GEX.6.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace"

GEX.8.d:0 "The scattered forces of Germany, now fled to Africa, have offered us much of the colonial territory they hold in [GEA.GetNameDef], if we will only end the war now before they are drawn in further.

GEX.9.t:0 "[GEX.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace"

This will involve ceding much of our territory, and there seems little hope of continuing the fight on our own with so many Reich officials already abandoning their offices here in [GEA.GetNameDef]. Our government is in complete disarray, and without support from the homeland it seems there is little we can do."
GEX.9.d.japan:0 "The German government, now fled to Africa and in utter disarray, has arranged for a peace with [From.GetNameDef]. This will involve our complete annexation, and there seems little hope of continuing the fight on our own with so many Reich officials already abandoning their offices here in [GEA.GetNameDef]. Our government is in complete disarray, and without support from the homeland it seems there is little we can do."

GEX.12.d:0 "The German government has collapsed and fled to Africa, assuming control over their former colonies here.

GEX.12.a:0 "Demand the colonies."
GEX.12.b:0 "We have had enough of war with the Germans."

GEX.13.t:0 "The [NFA.GetAdjective] Threat"
GEX.13.d:0 "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] has issued a threat - either we turn over the colonies which once belonged to them, or they will continue their war against us. Considering our current state of disarray, it might be wise to accept their demands. If not, we will be fighting them here in Africa."
GEX.13.a:0 "Give them what they want, if it will end this."
GEX.13.b:0 "We face them here in Africa, then."
