GEX.13.d:0 "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] has issued a threat - either we turn over the colonies which once belonged to them, or they will continue their war against us. Considering our current state of disarray, it might be wise to accept their demands. If not, we will be fighting them here in Africa."
GEX.13.a:0 "Give them what they want, if it will end this."
GEX.13.b:0 "We face them here in Africa, then."
