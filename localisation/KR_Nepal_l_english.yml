POLITICS_TRIBHUVANA_DESC: "King Tribhuvan ascended to the throne of Nepal at merely five years of age. Tribhuvan, however, was born king in name only, in reality, the boy-king was nothing more than a figurehead for the powerful Rana family. As he has grown into a man, Nepalese politics have become increasingly defined by the antagonistic relationship between the king and the Ranas. Time alone will reveal the victor of the struggle both politically and economically."
