### Events ###
illyria.1.t:0 "Kingdom of Illyria"
illyria.1.d:0 "The Triune Kingdom of Illyria, which consists of the former Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Kingdom of Dalmatia and Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina was proclaimed after the Crisis in Austria-Hungary and German Intervention in 1926. The creation of Illyria was proposed by the loyal to Vienna Croatian aristocrats and officers of the Austro-Hungarian Army, who promised to be loyal to the Kaiser Karl and Austria, but claimed more autonomy and the end of the Hungarian rule on the lands of the South Slavs. Though the Triune Kingdom should have become a home for the Catholic Croats, Orthodox Serbs and Muslim Bosniaks, in fact there are a lot of controversies between these nations. The Serbs want to reunite with their Serbian Motherland, the Bosniaks want to get more independence, and the Croats, who have a relative majority in the country, want to strengthen their position in the country and reorganise it into the Great Croatia. But now the Austrians help us to secure the order of our Balkan Kingdom."
illyria.1.a:0 "Our Beautiful Homeland!"

illyria.2.t:0 "Status of Montenegro"
illyria.2.d:0 "Montenegro was a small, but independent kingdom, which even the Ottoman Empire couldn't annex. But it was occupied in 1916 by the forces of Austro-Hungary and was incorporated into Illyria in 1926. But even now the Orthodox Montenegrins have a large autonomy in our state and accepted only these orders from Zagreb, which can't affect the life of this distant part of our country. More over, many of the local citizens are friendly to Serbia - our main enemy on the Balkans. We should keep it in mind, since any violation of the Montenegrin rights can provoke a crisis between Illyria and Serbia and even lead to a new Balkan war."
illyria.2.a:0 "Don't count on them."

illyria.3.t:0 "Matica ilirska"
illyria.3.d:0 "'Matica ilirska' ('Parent body of the Illyrians') is the oldest educational organisation in Illyria, which started its activity as a book publishing company in 1842. The main aim of 'Matica' is the promotion of the Illyrian culture and language and also support to the mutual understanding between the nations of Illyria. With help of the 'Matica ilirska' the leaders of Illyria try to form a well-educated and an united Illyrian nation. Now one of the most important missions of the organisation is the codification of the Illyrian language standard. Though it has been a hard work, but it seems that the most famous Illyrian writers and linguists have finally negotiated, which rules of the language our young generation will learn at schools. The creation of the united Illyrian nation is closer now!"
illyria.3.a:0 "Wistful is my Slavic soul, I'm Illyrian!"

illyria.4.t:0 "Sarajevo Agreement"
illyria.4.d:0 "The nations of our Triune Kingdom use one South Slavic language, but the Croat, Serbian and Bosnian versions of it have some differences. More over, the Serbs use the Cyrillic script, while the Croats and Bosniaks prefer the Latin script. 'Matica ilirska' has already established the united standards of the language, which will be used in our Kingdom, but we still don't know, how to name our language. We can name it 'Croatian' and use the Latin script, since the Croats constitute the majority in our country with 60% of the population. Another possible name is the 'Serbo-Croatian' with both Cyrillic and Latin scripts to represent the role of the Serbs, who are the main minority in Illyria with 30% of our citizens. Or we can name the language 'Illyrian' to encourage the unification of our people and use the Latin script."
illyria.4.a:0 "The Croat language is the only one in Illyria!"
illyria.4.b:0 "Long live Brotherhood and Unity - the Serbo-Croatian!"
illyria.4.c:0 "We are the Illyrians - and we speak Illyrian!"

illyria.5.t:0 "Highway 'Unity'"
illyria.5.d:0 "The construction of the highway 'Unity' was proposed by our prime minister in order to connect the biggest cities of the Illyria - Zagreb, Sarajevo and Podgorica. With the Austrian subsidies we will be able to hire enough workers and complete the construction soon. This project will also help us to reduce the unemployment rate in many our regions and revive the construction market in the Kingdom."
illyria.5.a:0 "We worked, we work and we will work even more!"

CRO_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "The Council of the Illyrians is the governing body of lands housing Bosnians, Croats, and Serbs that seek to create an Illyrian state that will benefit everyone, and not weigh one people over another. Formed in 1933, the Illyrian Council was formed by Kaiser Karl I in a federalist, trialist move, in the years of the aftermath of the South Slavic Revolts, in order for such a travesty to never occur on Imperial soil again. The Hungarians resent this Council, seeing their land as robbed by the Slavic burglars.\n Over the last three years, the Council has been organizing laws and negotiating with Slavic politicians, securing political alliances and ensuring a strong foundation for the kingdom. The Council is set to hold a popular election in 1936 to decide upon the first Governor of Illyria, a historic election that will undoubtedly decide the future of young Illyria."

### Ideas ###
ILL_croatian_command:0 "Croatian Officers"
ILL_croatian_command_desc:0 "The Croatian people fought to make an Illyria free of Austria a reality, while the rest of the so called Illyrians hid in their cities and did nothing. It is for this reason that we must restrict all officer positions to Croatians at the cost of alienating the rest of our countrymen."

ILL_federated_army:0 "United Officer Corp"
ILL_federated_army_desc:0 "Despite all odds, we have managed to win against all who sought to destroy our fledgling nation, but there is much still left to do. All the military officers of Illyria must be pooled into a single and united Illyrian Officer Corp."

CRO_SLOintegration:0 "Slovenian Integration"
CRO_SLOintegration_desc:0 "While we share much with our Slovenian brothers, the cost of integrating the region's administration and anger from within certain segments of the Slovenian population which minimize Slovene ties to our people have become a substantial burden."

ILL_council_of_the_illyrians_desc:0 "The Council of Illyrians is the provisional government in charge of Illyrian affairs. In power since 1933, the Council has prepared laws and watched closely the affairs of the people to best lay down the law. This government is about to be transitioned out of power with an election in the year 1936, a historic election that will define the path of the newborn Governorship of Illyria."

ILL_croat_supremacism_desc:0 "The Croatian people were the steel that reinforced the Illyrian ram, the ram that breached the Magyar gates. The Croats did this without the Bosnians, Serbs, or Montenegrins. These peoples instead hid and waited for us to do the work, instead of taking the fight to Budapest.\nThis is the story as it is told by the Croatians, who see themselves as superior to the Bosnians and the Serbs of Illyria. This attitude has the potential to bring future consequences, consequences that may eerily mirror the revolts of the 1920s."
ILL_scars_of_revolution:0 "Scars of the Revolts"
ILL_scars_of_revolution_desc:0 "The South Slavic Revolts of 1927-1931 were a series of sadistic rebellions that cropped up across the now-Illyrian landscape, partially due to festering wounds since the Central Powers' victory in 1921.\nThe root of the cause so soon, though, is linked to the coronation of Kaiser Karl I as King of Bohemia. This unrest nearly resulted in a Czech revolution, something the Southern Slavs saw, and decided to exploit. Unrest grew from 1926 onwards, when Karl I pardoned numerous nationalist Czech politicians to appease the situation in Bohemia. While this move capped the anger in Bohemia, it did little to stop the fires in Croatia and Bosnia. Thus the Revolts began soon after, more widespread conflicts around the region. While ultimately unsuccessful, the Austrians were forced to cede autonomy to Montenegro and withdraw from Serbia."
