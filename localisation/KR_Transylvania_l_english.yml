## Leader Bios ##
POLITICS_ALEXANDRU_VAIDAVOEVOD_DESC: "Born to a Greek-Catholic family Voevod was supportive of a plan to federalise the domains of the Habsburgs, and was close to Archduke Franz Ferdinand. In 1906, he joined a group of Romanian nationalists in the Budapest Parliament, becoming an important opponent of the Hungarian government, and fought for Transylvania's right for self-determination. Disappointed by the Austrian cause after Franz Ferdinand's assassination in Sarajevo he turned towards an advocacy of Transylvania's union with Romania."
