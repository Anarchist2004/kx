GBR_Colonial_Government: "Colonial Protectorate"
GBR_Colonial_Government_desc: "Following the 1925 revolution we have reluctantly sided with our former enemy Mittelafrika and requested their protection. This fact has remained largely unchanged since then and while the matter stands to be resolved in the future, its immediate impact is that Dar-es-salaam dictates our foreign policy for now."
