RUS_authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Eurasianism is a completely new ideology or philosophical and political thought, which is built on the theoretical foundation of Slavophilism and the works of Nikolai Trubetskoy and Peter Savitsky. The basic idea of Eurasianism is that the statehood and culture of the Russian people originated mainly from the Mongolian state and is much closer to Eastern despotisms than to Western liberal democracies. However, geography also plays a big role here: Russia, being throughout its history at the turn of two different civilizations - European and Asian, was able to embody their symbiosis, becoming a Eurasian civilization that combines the best of each. According to the plan of the Eurasians, who consider themselves a revolutionary, not a reactionary movement, the future of Russia lies in the power of a strong party that will unite all Eurasian peoples under the auspices of a single ideology that will unite them, not divide them."

rusdeminfo.10.d:0 "During the elections to the Constituent Assembly, the Mensheviks took second place. Having become the main party fighting for the rights of the proletariat in the absence of the Bolsheviks, the Mensheviks under the leadership of Yuliy Martov became a major proletarian party. However, in view of the key differences between Martov and Kerensky, the latter preferred a coalition with the Kadets, confirming Milyukov as prime minister. The Mensheviks, however, continued to cooperate with the government and were not in the full sense an opposition party, since Kerensky understood the importance of the workers' question and approved many Menshevik reforms.\n\nEven in the first years of republican rule, the split in the Menshevik party was obvious. On the one hand, there was a large faction of internationalists led by Martov, who had the greatest popularity. The victory of the proletarian revolution in France greatly strengthened their position. They were joined by a more radical group of internationalists, who had previously collaborated with the Bolsheviks, led by Lozovskiy. Having previously created a separate party, by 1920 this group had merged back into the Mensheviks. On the other side was a group of right-wing Mensheviks, headed by Askelrod. Their program did not presuppose an alliance with the communards, but a bet on the bourgeoisie and reform. However, Martov, who fell ill with tuberculosis in 1920, gradually withdrew from the leadership of the party, and his place as leader was taken by Rafail Abramovich, Deputy Chairman of the Central Committee of the RSDLP, a member of the Bund."

rusdeminfo.11.t:0 "RSDRP: 1923-1928"
rusdeminfo.11.d:0 "In 1923, Martov died of tuberculosis, in connection with which a New congress of the RSDRP was convened, which was once again won by the Internationalists, who were now led by Abramovich. During this period, a Bloc of New Bolsheviks, led by Bukharin and Rykov, also emerged, who managed to win over a part of the peasantry and the proletariat. However, the position of the Mensheviks was strengthened during the successful British Revolution of 1925, and the party leadership participated in the creation of the Third Internationale. This activity alarmed the more moderate Mensheviks, who still remembered Bolshevism perfectly well and were inclined to cooperate with the liberal parties and Socialists-Revolutionaries. Open cooperation with the Communards complicated the relations of the Mensheviks with the ruling parties, and the rhetoric of the Mensheviks gradually changed in the direction of sharply criticizing Kerensky and the Kadets.\n\nThe reform of the Senate in 1925, the radicalization of society and the emergence of the NRPR strengthened the position of Askelrod and the right-wing Mensheviks, who believed that the weakening of the Kerensky regime would only lead to the strengthening of the radicals and the fall of democracy. In 1927, the right-wing Mensheviks seized the initiative and began to dominate the Central Committee, and after the elections to the Duma, Askelrod was elected the new chairman of the party.\n\nAskelrod did much to rally the party and by the time of his death in 1928, the party was once again united and internal party differences were no longer so strong. The new leader of the party was Potresov, one of the founders of the party and a supporter of reformism."

rusdeminfo.12.t:0 "RSDRP: 1928-1936"
rusdeminfo.12.d:0 "Potresov, as the head of the party, established contacts with the Socialists-Revolutionaries and Kadets and became their close ally. Under his auspices, the party became a key agitator of workers' rights, and many Mensheviks were appointed to key positions, and most of the trade unions, including the VTsSPS, the organisation of Russian Trade Unions, became controlled by the Mensheviks.\nDespite his distrust of Bukharin, Potresov, like the rest of the leaders of the socialist parties, generally considers the creation of a homogeneous socialist government in an emergency, although this will not be an easy decision for the party."
rusdeminfo.12.a:0 "Cool"

rusdeminfo.13.t:0 "PSR: 1920-1927"
rusdeminfo.13.d:0 "The Socialist-Revolutionary Party has been the ruling party for the past 15 years. Nevertheless, most of the party's program was considered too radical by President Kerensky, who continued to remain a nominal member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party.\nAt the same time, the leader of the PSR, Viktor Chernov, remained in the shadows most of the time, being the speaker of the State Council until 1925, when it was transformed into the Senate, and then the speaker of the Duma until 1927, when he became a minister without portfolio. Chernov considered Kerensky only as an opportunity to promote Socialist-Revolutionary reforms and was always more inclined to ally with the Mensheviks than with the Kadets.\n\nDuring the first term of the SR-Kadet coalition and President Kerensky, the Social Revolutionaries lobbied in every possible way for a land reform that could solve the peasant question once and for all. However, the adoption of the law on the socialization of land was postponed in every possible way as well and in the end was only half adopted, leaving land in large cities and nearby provinces under private control. The unfinished land reform became a stumbling block in the relations between Chernov's centrist SRs and Kerensky's right SRS, hindered the stability of the government and reduced the popularity of the SRS and the president among the population. As a result of the unsuccessful reform, the dissatisfaction with the leadership of the party led to the emergence of new internal party factions: the center-left Volsky and Gerstein, who called themselves MPSR (The Minority of the PSR), whose positions were very close to the Left SR, but still rejected revolutionary socialism; and Savinkov, who managed to establish an entire right-wing party of ex-members of SRs, whose ideological position was further to the right."

rusdeminfo.14.t:0 "PSR: 1927-1936"
rusdeminfo.14.d:0 "The second term of the SR-Kadet coalition passed the same way as the first, but it was overshadowed by the strengthening of the power of the Senate, the economic crisis and German control. Kerensky's cooperation with the Senate and the Germans contributed to the deterioration of the popularity of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, as well as the final break between Kerensky and Chernov.\n\nThe elections of 1932, both presidential and parliamentary, marked the beginning of the end of the long rule of the SR-Kadet coalition and Kerensky. The Socialist-Revolutionaries lost the Duma elections of 1932, losing the majority to the NRPR, and only an electoral and parliamentary coalition with the Kadets saved them from a final loss. Starting in 1932, the legislation against opposition parties and assemblies was sharply tightened, largely due to Kerensky's fears about the activities of Savinkov and the NRPR, and by the beginning of 1936, attempts were made on many high-ranking officials, including Kerensky himself. Despite all of the above, there are still those in the Socialist-Revolutionary party who see the future of the party in cooperation with the Kadets, as well as those who are more inclined towards Savinkov."

rusdeminfo.15.t:0 "KDP: 1920-1925"
rusdeminfo.15.d:0 "The Party of Constitutional Democrats (Kadets), whose main electorate was liberal-minded landowners, industrialists, merchants, bankers, teachers, doctors, employees and intellectuals, took third place during the elections to the Constituent Assembly, thus becoming the only major non-socialist party. Already since 1920, the Kadet party has united various factions, which can be divided into Milyukov's centrist Kadets, Nekrasov's left Kadets, Progressives who joined the party, Nabokov's right Kadets, as well as individuals who supported Kolchak and were in his government. In addition, the party was conditionally divided into supporters of the republic and the monarchy.\n\nAfter the Constituent Assembly and the restoration of the republic, a number of programmatic and tactical issues somewhat diverted the various currents in the party from each other. In the end, the victory was won by the centrists of Milyukov, who was elected Prime-Minister in the Kerensky government.\n\nIn 1925, during the Kolchak putsch, many cadets, especially regional officials, went over to his side, and as a result founded their own party, known as the "Kadets of the Far-East", and in the Russian Republic the SR-Kadet coalition consolidated its power, which was destined to last for another 10 years."

rusdeminfo.16.t:0 "KDP: 1925-1936"
rusdeminfo.16.d:0 "By 1936, the situation of the cadets was not the best. The obvious failure of the SR-Kadet coalition and Kerensky, the unsuccessful reforms and the growing popularity of radical parties raises the question of the complete disappearance of the party. In addition to external threats, there are also internal ones. Pavel Milyukov refuses to nominate his candidacy for the post of Prime-Minister, and more and more the initiative in the left wing goes to Nikolay Nekrasov, who supports the resumption of the coalition with the revolutionary democrats (Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks), as well as strengthening the power of the Duma.\n\nOn the other hand, the power in the right wing belongs to the elderly Vladimir Nabokov, who still supports the restoration of the monarchy and an alliance with the conservatives. But if he fails in his endeavors, it is quite likely that Alexander Konovalov, who stands for a strong presidential power and tries to unite former Progressives into a new party of the bourgeoisie and entrepreneurs, will occupy the power vacuum."

rusdeminfo.17.t:0 "VNS: 1921-1925"
rusdeminfo.17.d:0 "The history of the All-Russian National Union began long before 1921, when in 1908 such a party was first created and united moderate-right politicians. Russian Russians who "belong to the indigenous Russian population or have organically merged with the Russian people"could become members of the VNS. Soon Vasily Shulgin, a well-known Russian nationalist, but of a progressive persuasion, joined the Union, who actually became the main speaker of the party and will still play a significant role in it.\n\nAfter the February Revolution, like other right-wing and monarchist parties, the VNS was banned, and was revived by the forces of Shulgin and Dmitry Romanov shortly after the second Constituent Assembly and the proclamation of Russia as a democratic federal republic. Having united all the right-wing, conservative and monarchist parties, the VNS soon became the main stronghold of the right in the new Russia.\n\nNot enjoying popularity among the general population, the main electorate of the VNS was mainly representatives of large capital, monarchical circles and conservative intellectuals. The number of seats in the Duma of the VNS has never exceeded 30 people. Everything changed in 1925, when Kerensky reformed the State Council and changed the electoral quotas, which allowed the Conservatives to gain a majority in the upper house of parliament by 1934. Dmitry Romanov became the Speaker of the Senate, and the Senate itself regularly re-elected Kerensky for a new term."

rusdeminfo.18.t:0 "VNS: 1925-1936"
rusdeminfo.18.d:0 "In the hope of reducing dependence on German capital, it was the senators-members of the VNS who proposed to Kerensky to begin a policy of protectionism aimed at developing domestic production. The state reduced trade with Germany, which in the short term led to a rapid growth of industry, but soon turned into a failure due to a reduction in important supplies of German equipment. This policy eventually led to the closure of most German enterprises and increased unemployment.\n\nHowever, nevertheless, the conservatives retained power in the Senate, and, moreover, they did not abandon the policy of protectionism, making it their central core of the economic program. Despite the seemingly unbreakable unity of the party, like other political parties, it is fragmented.\n\nThe two leading players in the VNS are Vasily Shulgin and Dmitry Romanov. The first, the formal leader of the party, advocates the restoration of the monarchy in a constitutional or semi-constitutional style, trying to achieve a referendum and nominate his candidate, who does not necessarily turn out to be from the Romanov dynasty.\nThe second, the speaker of the Senate and the acting acting president, rather has more selfish goals in strengthening his personal power, whether it is monarchical in connection with his quite legitimate claims to the throne, or republican as the head of an authoritarian aristocratic republic.\n\nHowever, there is also a third player in the VNS, Felix Yusupov, a close associate of Romanov, who sees the future of the country not in the expansion of the power of the aristocracy, but rather of the oligarchy and big capital - after all, having such associates, many roads will open up for Yusupov."

rusdeminfo.19.t:0 "EP: 1922-1925"
rusdeminfo.19.d:0 "The history of the Eurasianist Party begins in 1922, when several representatives of the intelligentsia, namely the linguist Nikolai Trubetskoy, the geographer and economist Pyotr Savitsky, the historian and religious thinker Georgy Florovsky, published a collection of articles entitled "Exodus to the East. Premonitions and achievements. The approval of the Eurasianists". Already in 1923, the Eurasianist Book Publishing House was created, which began to produce a program almanac of Eurasianists, as well as books of its leaders. In the same year, the Eurasianists are trying to get into politics for the first time by creating their own party, and also established ties with many prominent Russian cultural and scientific figures. By 1925, many prominent scientists G. V. Vernadsky, R. O. Yakobson, L. P. Karsavin, D. P. Svyatopolk-Mirsky, as well as the composer Stravinsky joined Eurasianism.\n\nThus, when the reform of the Senate was carried out, the Eurasianist party was already represented at the early senate elections and even managed to get several mandates."

rusdeminfo.20.t:0 "EP: 1925-1936"
rusdeminfo.20.d:0 "Since 1925, the popularity of the Eurasianists has been growing rapidly, due to the participation in the activities of the party or cooperation with it of many famous Russian people, and the idea of Eurasianism is closely intertwined with anti-German sentiments in society. The attractiveness of the idea of "rejecting Europe", as well as the positioning of the Eurasianists as a revolutionary movement, resonated with many right-wing and conservative-minded masses, in fact, thus taking away almost the entire Republican electorate of the National Assembly.\n\nIn 1932, the Eurasianists were able to gain 4% in the Duma elections and get 22 seats, becoming the smallest faction in the parliament. Nevertheless, Kerensky, in order to ensure his power, appointed 16 Eurasianist senators out of 50 presidential senators, mostly representatives of aristocratic circles.\n\nBy 1936, however, even in the Eurasianist Party there are ideological divisions. In addition to the" Center " of the party, the so-called Council of Three: Trubetskoy, Savitsky and Vernadsky, the party demonstrates a clear left bias in the views of Mirsky, who is politically affiliated with the marginal national maximalist party of Prince Shikhmatov-Shirinsky. In addition to the left bias, there is a minor right bias: a young member of the party, Lev Gumilev, the leader of the Union of Eurasianist Youth, adheres to much more nationalistic and radical ideas about the transformation of Russia into Eurasia. In addition, there are politicians in the Central Committee of the Eurasianist Party with their own personal views on the development of Eurasianism: Jacobson, who promotes social-democratic ideas in Eurasianism; Tyrkova-Williams, who supports the liberalization of the regime and the access of the broad masses to Eurasianism; Chkheidze, who supports the creation of a Eurasianist monarchy.\n\nThus, the party is really divided. But so far, these differences are not so obvious, but they will clearly surface as soon as the Eurasianists come to power."

rusdeminfo.21.t:0 "NRPR: 1924-1932"
rusdeminfo.21.d:0 "Kerensky's second term was overshadowed not only by Kolchak's campaign, but also by the growth of radicalism in society, the creation of new parties and organizations that demanded radical changes. The New Bolsheviks bloc, created by Rykov and Bukharin, took shape into a political party, the NSP, and began to promote its ideas of a gradual transition to socialism. And after the Kolchak coup and the loss of the Kuban and Eastern Siberia, in the wake of anti-German sentiments, Boris Savinkov, one of the prominent leaders of the SRs, a terrorist and revolutionary, defender of the peasants and vigilant anti-Bolshevik, creates a huge bloc of right-wing Republican parties - the People's Republican Party of Russia.\n\nFor the first years Savinkov worked to tear the Right SRs away from Kerensky. Using Kerensky's "cowardly" policy and an alliance with the increasingly syndicalist Left SRS, Savinkov was able to convince them to join a coalition with him. However, Kerensky quickly understood this game, and began to strengthen the role of the Senate, appointing moderate conservatives there who would ensure his eternal presidency.\n\nIn 1927, the first elections were held with the participation of the NRPR, and the party immediately managed to win almost 19%, receiving 118 Duma mandates. Savinkov gained access to the Duma, and often spoke from the rostrum as an opponent of Kerensky, Socialist Revolutionaries, liberals and monarchists, preparing to take the place of prime minister by 1932.\n\nHis plans were hindered by several facts: firstly, the PLSR left the coalition with the NRPR, annoyed by Savinkov's even if not chauvinistic, but rather nationalist rhetoric, and the cult of personality that had developed within the party. Secondly, the PSR-KDP pre-election coalition has once agained won the majority, though separately they would have definetely lost to Savinkov."

rusdeminfo.22.t:0 "NRPR: 1932-1936"
rusdeminfo.22.d:0 "Realizing the power of his influence, Savinkov began to actively promote his own ideas. Being a revolutionary and a supporter of terrorism, he creates a paramilitary wing of the party - the Combat Organisation of the NRPR (BO-NRPR). The actual declaration of war was the violent police dispersal of an anti-government demonstration of People's Republicans on the anniversary of the February Revolution in 1934.\n\nBy 1936, the 'Vozhd' was able to rally the entire revolutionary and protest electorate, and his victory in the next elections, if not unconditional, is very likely."
rusdeminfo.22.a:0 "What about Solidarists?"

rusdeminfo.23.t:0 "NSNP: 1930-1936"
rusdeminfo.23.d:0 "The National Union of the New Generation is a political party that emerged from the organization "National Union of Russian Youth" in 1930, when the Central Committee was formed and the party charter was adopted. A new principle was also introduced into the Charter of the NSNP — the age limit. Now only those born after 1895 could enter the Union. The age limit, according to the members of the Union, was supposed to protect the organization from "the sins and prejudices of the past," that is, from the influence of old party figures, who were partly blamed for the tragedy of Russia.\n\nIf we talk about the ideological foundation of the NSNP, it arose on the ruins of the Civil War, rabid anti-communism and anti-socialism, and was only reinforced by the unsuccessful reforms of Kerensky. In contrast to socialism and war, the young guys of the NSNP put forward the idea of solidarity and unity of Russian society, which they made the main motto of the party, and from where they got their fame as "Solidarists". However, when in 1931 the Solidarists began to prepare for the Duma elections, they found out that they had too few levers to get into parliament. Therefore, Viktor Baidalakov, the party leader, decided to join the coalition bloc of Savinkov's NRPR. This alliance allowed the Solidarists to get into parliament, but at the same time put them in a state of dependence on the NRPR and Savinkov's authority, as a result of which the Solidarists were actually eclipsed by the People's Republicans.\n\nDespite the fact that formally all Solidarists are also members of the NRPR, this alliance is fragile. Savinkov's NRPR is seen by Solidarists as a socialist party uniting radical right-wing social revolutionaries, which is partly true, and is reflected in some program points, while the NSNP opposes the generalization of property in any form. However, the parties have many similarities, namely, Russian nationalism and hatred of the Bolsheviks, syndicalists, and other openly socialist movements.\n\nIf Savinkov's party loses the elections or loses significant public support, it is quite possible that the Solidarists will start their own game. And they have every chance to win."

rusdeminfo.24.t:0 "NSP: 1920-1927"
rusdeminfo.24.d:0 "When the Red Army and the Council of People's Commissars of the RSFSR capitulated in 1920, most of the Bolsheviks, who were not arrested, left for Revolutionary France to establish the Bolshevik government-in-exile. However, the humiliated and weakened party was split and devastated. The new leader of the Bolsheviks after Lenin's death, Grigory Zinoviev, professed the Leninist ideology of the dictatorship of the party, and, it would seem, absolutely did not want to admit the failure of this idea, even being in a Commune, where a much more democratic syndicalism prevailed. Against this background, the right wing took shape in the RKP, which relied on the support of the peasantry, not the proletariat, and proposed the idea of a gradual transition to socialism. The leaders of this wing were Nikolay Bukharin and Aleksey Rykov. The split reached its apotheosis in 1921, when Bukharin and Rykov, as well as a number of their associates, left the party, and having agreed with the Kerensky government, arrived in Russia, publicly disavowing ties with former party members.\n\nAlready in 1922, in the wake of small peasant uprisings against Famine, the occupation of the Far East by Japanese imperialists and the East Karelian Uprising, Bukharin and Rykov undertook the creation of an organization called the New Bolsheviks Bloc. The Russian government distrusted this organization and strictly controlled it so that it could not take shape into a new political force.\n\nHowever, the Kerensky regime was still too weak and in 1924, a few months before Kolchak's coup, the New Bolsheviks Bloc was transformed into the People's Socialist Party, occupying an empty niche of left-wing non-parliamentary parties. However, the party was not particularly popular, largely due to the image of Bukharin and Rykov as former Bolsheviks, and in 1927 could not overcome the 5% barrier to parliament." 

rusdeminfo.25.t:0 "NSP: 1927-1936"
rusdeminfo.25.d:0 "Kerensky still saw the NSP as a threat and, having strengthened his own power, he decided to ban the activities of the NSP, forcing Bukharin to go underground. In 1930, when the Russian economy fell again, and Kerensky begged for German loans, the popularity of radical parties increased dramatically. After the ban, the NSP began to actively promote anti-German and anti-Kerensky slogans.\n\nAfter the elections of 1932, the NSP began to establish ties with revolutionary socialist parties, primarily with the left SRS, and near-revolutionary ones, including the left Mensheviks and center-left SRS, insisting on the creation of a homogeneous socialist government from a plurality of parties and the transition to a system of Soviets.\n\nOf course, there were serious contradictions between the NSP and other socialist parties, the main one of which was the economic program. The "New Economic Policy" proposed by Bukharin in 1933 became the main cause not only of discord between the socialist parties, but also within the NSP. As a result of the new economic program, the NSP became the only one of all the left-wing parties that considered private ownership of land, albeit temporary, but a necessary measure. The fact that the peasants will be able to extract profit from the land has inclined a sufficient part of the electorate to the side of the NSP. At this time, a wing of trade unionists, inspired by the successes of the syndicalists and focused more on the working class, under the leadership of Mikhail Tomsky, ideologically took shape within the party.\n\nNow that the ban on the political activities of the NSP has been lifted and they can participate in the elections, only a coalition with other socialist parties can help Bukharin lead the Popular Front."

rusdeminfo.26.d:0 "The Party of the Left Socialists-Revolutionaries in 1920 was on the verge of extinction. First the allies of the Bolsheviks, then their sworn enemies, the Left SRS, by the end of the civil war, were left without support and associates. And although they were never able to regain their former popularity, they were able to survive, largely thanks to their own enthusiasm and optimism.\n\nUnlike the Bolsheviks, after the war, the Left SRS were not banned or arrested, and the absolute majority of those arrested by Whites fell under amnesty. Kerensky and the Democrats did not see them as opponents, given the unpopularity of their ideas. Despite the political oblivion, the left srs did not give up trying to raise their rating. The famine that broke out in 1921 raised many Left SRS to revolt against the government, and helped them win the trust of the common people.\n\nBy 1922, there were two main groups in the PLSR: Activists and Legalists. The Activists, led by Maria Spiridonova, the 'Valkyrie of the Russian Revolution', believed that the current Socialist-Revolutionary government, united with the Kadets, had betrayed the peasantry and the ideas of populism, and that only a revolutionary struggle could overthrow their bourgeois power. The Legalists, under the leadership of Isaak Steinberg, believed that it was necessary to cooperate with the regime established in Russia, primarily in the interests of the peasantry. However, in general, the movement was united, realizing that an even greater split would only put an end to the left SRS and write them down in the pages of history textbooks.\n\nAt about the same time, Steinberg's anarcho-syndicalist economic-political doctrine on the creation of a syndicalist-cooperative federation of economic bodies of workers' self-government - factory committees (syndicates) and political councils of labor collectives (soviets) was officially entrenched in the program of the left Social revolutionaries. The ideology of the Left SRs began to border on anarchism and extreme libertarian socialism, assuming the widest freedoms for the working classes."

rusdeminfo.27.t:0 "PLSR: 1925-1936"
rusdeminfo.27.d:0 "How did it happen that in 1926 the anarcho-syndicalist party of the left SRS joined the coalition of Savinkov's right-wing parties? The fact is that both Spiridonova and Savinkov pursued their own political goals. Savinkov tried to attract as many politicians as possible from among the former members of the PSR to his side. Spiridonova wanted to get a platform to promote her own ideas in parliament, as well as to regain popularity among the population. However, shortly after the 1927 elections, the Left SRs left the coalition, having existed for only about a year. This was facilitated by nationalist and dictatorial sentiments within the NRPR, as well as the fact that of the 118 mandates in the Duma received by the NRPR, none went to the left SRS.\n\nThe social upheavals that have been taking place in Russian society since 1927 have been actively used by the PLSR for its own purposes, as criticism of the government and statements about the need for a revolutionary struggle. Since 1927, the Left SRS have become the leading actors in strikes and peasant uprisings and have attracted a sufficient part of the left-wing radical electorate to their side. Spiridonova's popularity also grew, whose image as a symbol of the Russian revolution was firmly entrenched not only in the minds of the population, but also of the government, which, by decree of President Kerensky in 1928, banned the activities of Left SRS.\n\nNow, on the eve of the upcoming elections, the Left SRs have once again united with the Bolsheviks, as they did almost 20 years ago, but this time their goals are common - to win elections and establish people's Soviet power."

In this case, until July 1936, when the Senate must elect a new president of Russia by a simple majority.\n\nDespite the authoritarianism of this approach, it is there, and Dmitry Pavlovich Romanov, the current Speaker of the Senate, will hold the position of acting president until the next election.\n\nWhile Dmitry Romanov is in power, he can do a lot to strengthen his power, even though he has no real power, he is supported by the Senate. The situation is compounded by the fact that no party that can win the snap elections will be able to gain a majority in the authoritarian Senate, which is very likely to want to elect Dmitry Romanov as the legitimate president.\n\nIf this happens, we will find ourselves in a situation that Kerensky did not anticipate: the risk of strengthening the power of the Senate and the President, and a sharp reduction in the power of the Duma.

In order to save Russia from the victory of the NRPR and Savinkov in the elections, for the first time in the history of the republic, an electoral coalition of all left forces was formed. The Popular Front included the left Socialist Revolutionaries, Bukharin's people's socialists, and the Mensheviks.

Hoping to break from obscurity as quickly as possible, Savinkov and the NRPR took loan after loan to fund their political campaigns, and they hoped that they would be able to write off all of their debts upon coming to power. This has not happened and the movement has found itself severely indebted, with no way to pay off their staff or workers, and popular support for them waning because of ongoing economic stabilisation.\n\nSavinkov was forced to lay off campaigners, disband many of the party's branches, and significantly cut the size of the Combat Squads. His movement has started to splinter, the left wing has broken off and its leaders began blasting Savinkov in national newspapers, accusing him of running the NRPR as a clique of yesmen... all in all, it has not been a good year for them. Popular support for the NRPR has decayed, their rallies have ceased, and their deputies in the Duma have chosen to ally with the SRs and Eurasianists.\n\nIt appears that Savinkov's hopes of taking power in Russia have been dashed for good."

rusdem.300.d:0 "No matter how it might seem from the side of the beautiful idyll of the two socialist parties - the Left SRs, led by Spiridonova, and the People's Socialists, led by Bukharin, their coalition turned out to be nothing more than a conspiracy for the sake of passing the barrier to the Duma. Despite the fact that the parties have formed a government coalition, there is still much to change in the country.\nIn the conditions of a minority and partly hostile Senate, as well as an absolute lack of confidence on the part of the army, the coalition has huge plans.\n\nThe Prime Minister and the government of the country, of course, are forced to cooperate with the coalition party, but every day the connection between them weakens. In the near future, the government will organize an official meeting with representatives of the trade union movement. The All-Russian Conference of Trade Unions will also be attended by ministers, as well as prominent members of both parties. The media already call the congress unprecedented and decisive for the fate of many citizens, especially workers."
rusdem.300.a:0 "May unity be more important than politics?"

rusdem.301.t:0 "The Beginning of the Trade Unions Conference"
rusdem.301.d:0 "Today, an All-Russian Conference of Trade Unions is scheduled to take place in Moscow, with the participation of the government and the leadership of the PLSR and NSP parties. According to eyewitnesses, many have already arrived at the congress, including the leaders of the parties, Nikolay Bukharin and Maria Spiridonova.\n\nThe key issues that will be raised at the congress are, of course, about the future of trade unions in Russia. At the moment, most of the trade unions are controlled by the Mensheviks, many of the state trade unions are united in the VTsSPS - formally a state association.\n\nThe positions of the NSP and the PLSR on the issue of the work of trade unions remain controversial and hinder the normal functioning of the coalition. Bukharin's position is that reconciliation is necessary on this issue. All trade unions should be nationalized, that is, become state-owned and their activities should be subordinate to the state. This approach is criticized by other members of the NSP, the so-called Trade-Unionist faction, headed by Tomsky. He proposes the syndicalization of trade unions, namely, their control over economic activity, as well as their existence as separate independent cells of workers' self-government. This approach is also shared by the Party of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries, but in the other way. They believe that the national economy should be managed by economic Soviets, created by elected representatives of unions of self-governing enterprises and cooperative unions."

As the head of the All-Russian Union of Trade Unions since 1922 and the general secretary of the Profintern since 1921, Lozovsky is one of the key figures in the left wing of the RSDRP and in the Russian trade union movement. Although he left his position in the VTsSPS for the presidency, he felt it necessary to express his point of view.\n\nLozovsky called for leaving the trade unions alone. He said that the existing system is quite effective, as it allows workers to organize themselves, and the state to have large trade union associations under its control. Losing the status-quo, and, therefore, this balance, will lead to drastic consequences for the proletariat. Nevertheless, he pointed out that he will not veto the Bill."

The harsh civil war, which claimed millions of lives, as well as the lives of their former comrades, seriously affected the formation of the Russian Army in the post-war years. With some exceptions, most of the generals are quite conservative, and many officers are not ready to fight for socialist ideas.

rusdem.306.d:0 "Speaking in Parliament today, Prime Minister Bukharin harshly went through the current political system, paying special attention to the fact that as a result of Kerensky's actions for his own enrichment, the country was on the verge of economic collapse and famine. There is poverty everywhere, and the peasants are suffering because of the unsuccessful land reform.\n\nIn his address, Bukharin also highlighted the importance of adopting his New Economic Program, which will put the country on its feet and lead to an improvement in the situation in the national economy."

rusdem.307.t:0 "NEP Bill Passed!"

These bourgeois capitalists, who occupied half of the seats in parliament, seem to imagine themselves the arbiters of the destinies of millions of ordinary peasants! Due to our control over the government, we can bypass the State Duma and start introducing the NEP as part of the new financial and economic policy of the government, and no duma can prevent us from doing this."
rusdem.308.a:0 "Go on with NEP!"

rusdem.309.t:0 "Start of the NEP"
rusdem.309.d:0 "The Government headed by Prime Minister Bukharin has launched an economic reform to transform into a planned economy. So far, private property remains in our country, and it will be very difficult to nationalize it. According to Bukharin's plan, it will be necessary to abolish private property in large cities, as well as to complete Kerensky's unfinished land reform. It is proposed to finally socialize the socialized land in the hands of local peasant councils, but at the same time allow the peasants to earn on their own harvest. Thus, the peasants will have an incentive to work, and the pace of agricultural development will increase significantly.\n\nThe situation is different in the city, where private property is planned to be completely abolished and all factories to be nationalized. Such a doctrine within the framework of the NEP was called "Socialism - in the city, Capitalism - in the village". This will allow cities to develop under the control of the state and industrialize, and agriculture to develop and feed the multi-million population of the country. In addition, the government plans to prohibit foreign companies from owning property on the territory of Russia, with the exception of some concessions."
rusdem.309.a:0 "Time to implement the NEP!"

rusdem.310.t:0 "Confiscation of Private Property"
rusdem.310.d:0 "Today will be remembered by many capitalists for a long time, because in large Russian cities, the most important strategic factories that were still in private hands were nationalized. One of these organizations was the famous Society of Putilov Factories. Already once nationalized by the Bolsheviks in 1918, and then returned by Kerensky, the Society of Putilov Factories was again nationalized, and again by the Bolsheviks, although already former.\n\nIn addition to the Society of Putilov Factories, many other enterprises were nationalized, including foreign ones associated with Putilov, which he undoubtedly perceived as attacks on himself personally. Putilov made a public speech in the Duma, where he condemned the actions of the government, but received only ridicule from the socialist majority in parliament. Putilov said that he intends to appeal to the Supreme Court and return the lost property.\n\nMany other rich owners have also stated similar problems, however, they must respect the people who elected the NSP, and they have no choice but to admit that their personal losses are for the benefit of the whole of Russia."

rusdem.311.d:0 "In the major cities of Russia, there are small protest movements of capitalists, but especially of the middle class of small bourgeois and philistines, who also lost some property. They demand compensation from the state for the nationalization of their property. The government can make concessions to them and allocate compensation funds, but in this way we will lose points in the eyes of ordinary workers and peasants, as well as other socialist parties. At the same time, if we do not do this, we will suffer for some time from outraged capitalists."

rusdem.312.d:0 "Despite the fact that our state cannot yet be called a full-fledged workers 'and peasants' state, the importance of uniting the two revolutionary classes is very necessary. The fact is that the workers do not get along very well with the peasants, whom they perceive as kulaks and bourgeois who can earn much more by their labor than they do. Despite the fact that we have raised wages and reduced the hours of workers, there is still a high level of urban unemployment.\n\nPrime Minister Bukharin stated:\n'The essence of the New Economic Policy is the union of the Proletariat and the Peasantry, the essence is in the smychka (link) of Vanguard Proletariat with a Wide Peasant Field.'"

rusdem.313.t:0 "Subsidies to Peasants"
rusdem.313.d:0 "To stimulate agriculture, it is necessary to allocate subsidies to newly minted farmers for the purchase of the latest agricultural equipment and the gradual mechanization of agriculture. This will give the peasants an incentive to cultivate Russian fields, and the money received from taxes will go to the industrialization of cities.\n\nDespite the fact that our partners in the socialist bloc in the Duma strongly opposed subsidizing wealthy peasants, and some deputies even accused us of developing capitalist relations in the countryside, the government is convinced that these measures are necessary."
rusdem.313.a:0 "We will receive this money back in taxes."

rusdem.314.t:0 "On the Issue of Private Entrepreneurship"
rusdem.314.d:0 "The situation in the city has raised an open question about the future of small business owners. On the one hand, along with the nationalization of many enterprises and an almost complete ban on private entrepreneurship, there is still a sector of goods and services that are not particularly important for the economy in private hands. Prime Minister Bukharin said that for a smoother transition to the socialist economy, these sectors will remain private. Thus, capitalist relations will remain in the city, but at a small level. In addition, as the Prime Minister stated, how does a small-scale farmer or merchant differ from a worker and a peasant?"

Well remembering the horrors of the Civil War, the generals are very wary of the socialists, but during the reign of Kerensky, a certain consensus was reached that allowed the Russian army to develop at least.\n\nHowever, now that outright socialists are in power, riots and a boycott have begun in the army, affecting the entire combat capability of the Russian ground troops. On the part of the generals, refusal to carry out orders has become commonplace, and on the part of the officers, mass desertion and dismissal have been noticed.\n\nThus, we need to solve this urgent problem and restore order in the troops, because Russia is surrounded by enemies and their puppets. If we do not manage to restore order in the army in time, we may face armed resistance 'for the sake of preserving the democracy'."

Despite the fact that he is not a monarchist and advocated a Republican system, his authoritarian tendencies and the presence of influence that allows him to seize power in the country are very annoying for the current leadership. By removing the head of the army and appointing a new commander-in-chief, we will be able to avoid problems in the future.\n\nHowever, this is not all. The head of the General Staff, Anton Denikin, although he stands for democracy and is not against the republic, popularly called the "Peasant Marshal", can also be dangerous, and probably should be replaced by a more "friendly" candidate.\n\nPyotr Wrangel, the "Black Baron", an ardent opponent of socialism and an inveterate monarchist, closes the problematic trinity. Although he does not formally hold any government posts, he is the vice-president of Kornilov in the ROVS, and has a huge influence, probably more than the two above-mentioned personalities.\n\nWe need to decide their fate in the near future, thus easing our situation."

His appointment caused a flurry of criticism of the government, but having a like-minded person at the head of the Army only strengthened him. Soon Malinovsky appealed to the President with a demand to begin the speedy reform of the Army.\n\nAt the same time, Kornilov reacted quite sharply to his resignation and reacted even more sharply to the appointment of Malinovsky, saying that the boy hardly held a real weapon in his hands. Fearing Kornilov's uprising, we can quietly remove him... or leave it alone. Perhaps a compromise option would be to settle him in a state dacha and give certain guarantees, but it is unlikely that Kornilov will silently agree to this..."

However, according to eyewitnesses, there was a fuss in the apartment, and a black car of the Nizhny Novgorod plant was standing under the windows.\n\nThe very next day after the news, a fairly large rally gathered in Moscow demanding an investigation into the General's death, and many prominent officers made the same demands. On the one hand, we can officially recognize the death as natural, but we will lose the support of people and only raise even greater doubts.

Kornilov has greatly contributed to post-revolutionary Russia's politics. Two weeks of national mourning have been declared as the people prepare for the funeral ceremony."
rcw.3.a:0 "The great helmsman of the Russian nation is no more." 

rcw.4.t:0 "Kornilov Raises An Uprising"
rcw.4.d:0 "Ignoring Kornilov, we were faced with the fact that he managed to get out of the capital and go to the South of Russia, where he began to convene a rather conservative electorate to defend the Motherland from the socialists. Thus, creating essentially a second Volunteer army. He was joined in the majority by other generals who declared loyalty to the former regime and the impossibility of serving the socialist minority. It seems that the situation is heating up and we need to take urgent measures..."

With the coming to power of the Socialist Party, relations between Denikin, as well as other conservative generals, and the government deteriorated significantly. Denikin's sudden death aroused suspicions even among some supporters of the current government, let alone the opposition-minded electorate. Baron Wrangel, one of the closest associates of Kornilov and Denikin, claimed that the murder was covered up by the government and demanded that the government immediately resign and transfer power into the hands of the provisional government, which he will lead."

His views have long been the subject of rumors, but now they have been confirmed. Vasilevsky is respected among the generals, and therefore Denikin's resignation was not taken so seriously. Nevertheless, the former head of the General Staff himself announced an attempt to seize power, and no matter how paradoxical it may sound, he said that he intends to lead a popular uprising against the government. His statements violate the laws of our country and we should have arrested him to avoid trouble."

Despite the fact that the army still does not trust us, at least they have stopped rebelling."

rcw.18.t:0 "Kornilov Surrenders"
rcw.18.d:0 "Kornilov, to our great happiness, agreed to surrender and submit to the demand of our ultimatum. The general was soon arrested and will soon be tried for attempting to organize a military coup. His stupid act allowed us to accuse the counter-revolutionary and conservative army elite of trying to usurp power and trying to overthrow the legally elected people's government, thus significantly expanding the repressive actions against the generals. The popular support was on our side.\n\nIn addition to General Kornilov, Denikin, Wrangel, Drozdovsky, and Markov, as well as all other generals connected with them in any way, were also purged. All of them were dismissed from their posts, or from the General Staff and arrested.\n\nDespite the fact that many talented generals were subjected to repression, our government is no longer in danger."

rcw.200.d:0 "After the ROVS seized power, proclaiming Kornilov as interim president, Petrograd workers began to strike against the military, demanding free elections and an increase in their standard of living.\n\nThe first strike began with the Putilov plant, but by noon the strike had engulfed all major industrial enterprises of the capital and gained mass character. The police forces were not enough to suppress the protest, and the next day the strike continued and other citizens who were dissatisfied with the seizure of power by the military joined the protest.\n\nThe situation escalated and became sharply radicalized when a number of generals sympathetic to the proletariat sided with the rebels. While the uprising in Petrograd has not spread to other regions with the effect of falling dominoes, we need to nip it in the bud, either by suppressing the uprising harshly, or make concessions to the working class and, despite the crisis, meet their demands."
rcw.200.a:0 "Power to the Toilers!"

rcw.201.t:0 "Leaders of the Protest Evolved"
rcw.201.d:0 "The protests of Petrograd workers have been going on for several days, and so far the riot looks disjointed and without clear leaders. Of those who are capable of leading a crowd, so far not a single party has stood up for the workers.\n\nHowever, today the news came that generals who defected to the side of the rebels arrived in Petrograd, and among them, none other than General Zhukov became one of those who spoke at a protest rally of many thousands. The general, still quite energetic and not long-lived, announced his intention to create a Petrograd Soviet that would lead the protest uprising. Many, however, took this idea warily, remembering how the last time an organ with the same name failed. Many were afraid of the development of a new civil war, and distrusted the general, who fought for a short time for the Bolsheviks until he fell ill. \n\nOn the other hand, the charismatic leader of the left SRS, Maria Spiridonova, spoke at the protest rally, who fervently convinced the audience of the need for an immediate revolution, until the reactionaries in the person of the ROVS condemned the workers and peasants to a new slavery. She called for the transfer of all power in the country to trade unions and peasant councils under the auspices of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party and announced that until the bulk of the working people join the uprising, it is doomed to failure.\n\nToday has passed without much upheaval, but in the near future the protesters will need to make a choice that will decide the fate of the whole of Russia in the near future - the collegial power of trade unions and councils of left SRS or the sole power of Red Generals for effective military action against reactionaries."

According to rumors, the ROVS had to go to the south of Russia and organize an operation center in Volgograd, where their support was still quite strong. The working people have gained a lot of strength and energy under the awareness of the fact that many cities have already risen to the defense of the working class.\n\nHowever, at the same time, newspapers announced that a delegation of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party, headed by Bolshevik Zinoviev, had arrived incognito in Petrograd from abroad. They were seen at one of the rallies in the capital, where they called for an armed struggle and the unification of workers under the rule of the Bolshevik Party. This event caused a resonance among the population, many of whom remembered the failure of the Bolsheviks and the Red Terror, and distrusted them. Others, albeit a minority, picked up the revolutionary slogans of the RKP and called on the rest to listen to the Bolshevik leaders."

Already today, this decision has been made and the Extraordinary Supreme Council of Workers and Peasants under the leadership of Maria Spiridonova has become the head of the new revolutionary government, where representatives of the NSP in the person of Bukharin and Tomsky, as well as Mensheviks-Internationalists in the person of the leader of the VTsSPS, Lozovsky, also received ministerial seats. \n\nThe news of the creation of the ChVSRK and a homogeneous socialist government quickly went around the entire European part of Russia, and in many rural regions, peasants and workers announced the creation of local councils and subordination to the central government. Many regions joined the all-Russian uprising, with the exception of those regions where the sentiments of Savinkov's associates were strong, who, despite his pro-peasant views, was ignored by the Supreme Soviet.\n\nNow that power in large cities and rural regions has come under the control of the Soviets of workers and peasants, the ChVSRK hope for the speedy subordination of the rest of Russia to the working people."

In this region, the support of the NRPR is very high, as well as the Green Army of Antonov, who, although he himself was a left SR before, joined Savinkov after the civil war. \n\nWe need to seize power in Tambov, where the socialists are not completely deprived of support and convince the population of the reactionary views of the people's Republicans. If we cannot convince them to join the true force representing the working class, that we will have to fight them already by armed means."

The most notable are Georgy Zhukov, Boris Shaposhnikov and some others.

However, there is still something we should concern.\n\nAmong one of Kornilov's main concerns are left-wing Social revolutionaries who have intercepted the workers' agenda and are looking for opportunities to lead the revolution. In addition, they are one of the few parties that openly called for revolution. We can try to arrest the leaders of the left SRS before they can lead the protest, but for this we will most likely have to turn to the help of Savinkov's combat detachments."

However, his socialist views, which always questioned his loyalty, were confirmed.\n\nZhukov arrived in Petrograd, where he led revolutionary soldiers and workers and announced the creation of a socialist republic.

Trade unions, factory committees, cooperatives - all called for an all-Russian strike and the transfer of power to representatives of the working class.\n\nUnfortunately, the new Russian government led by Kornilov had to go to the south of Russia and organize an operational center in Volgograd, where their support was still quite strong."

In 1918, Centrosibir fell to the White forces, but now a lot can change, because in a vast territory that is not yet controlled by any White general, the chances of a successful uprising are higher."

rusdem.351.t:0 "Appeal to the Deputies of the Duma"
rusdem.351.d:0 "The Party of People's Republicans, led by Prime Minister Savinkov, today issued an appeal to the other members of the State Duma, where it called on the lower house of parliament to unite for the destruction of the stronghold of Kerenskyism, the monarchical-aristocratic Senate, which prevents the adoption of laws vital for the economy and stability in the country that can help ordinary people.\n\nLater, in the Tauride Palace, during a Duma meeting, Prime Minister Savinkov himself spoke from the rostrum, declaring the beginning of the fight against corruption in the ranks of senators and that the NRPR party would seek compliance with democratic and republican principles of the work of all chambers of parliament and the government. Savinkov noted that the program of his party, which honestly won the elections, is able to help the deteriorating economic situation, pull the peasantry out of the bondage of Kerensky's land reform, as well as the destruction of corruption among senators.\n\nSavinkov finished his speech with a quote: \"And while the senators, servants of German capital, are sitting there, robbing our people, they should keep in mind that we will fight for the rights of the peasants! And if they do not resign their mandates voluntarily, we will regard this as a coup!\""
rusdem.351.a:0 "The Senators must resign!"

rusdem.352.t:0 "Savinkov Meets Chernov"
rusdem.352.d:0 "Today, the Prime Minister visited the leader of the Duma faction of Socialist Revolutionaries, his former party member Viktor Chernov.\n\nChernov looked preoccupied, and even nervous, and it seems that he did not even hide this state of his. Savinkov and Chernov had a fairly formal conversation for an hour, in which they discussed the possible entry of the srs into a government coalition with the NRPR. However, after an hour, the doors of Chernov's office were closed to prying ears and eyes, and Savinkov and Chernov spent several more hours in private conversation.\n\nIt is not known for certain what the Prime Minister tried to negotiate with Chernov. It is quite possible that in order to resist the Senate, it needs other allies, and what is better than the Srs, whose ideology is largely the basis of the NRPR program. In addition, Savinkov himself was a Socialist-Revolutionary for a long time, namely, a participant and head of a Combat Organization.\n\nThe conversation remained a secret, at least for now, because when Savinkov and Chernov left the office, none of them said a word."
rusdem.352.a:0 "We will know the truth soon, probably."

rusdem.353.t:0 "Chernov Refused Cooperation With NRPR"
rusdem.353.d:0 "A few days passed after the meeting between the Prime Minister and Chernov. And now its results have become known. In a public speech, Viktor Chernov said that the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries will not cooperate with any party, organization or people who encroach on democracy, the constitution and freedom. It is obvious that Chernov meant the Party of People's Republicans, which means that the negotiations failed and the NPRR lost one more possible ally."
rusdem.353.a:0 "We won't forget this."

rusdem.354.t:0 "NRPR-PSR Coalition?"
rusdem.354.d:0 "A few days passed after the meeting between the Prime Minister and Chernov. And now its results have become known. Today it became known that the Socialist-Revolutionary Party will enter into a government coalition with the NRPR, in which Chernov himself will probably take the chair of the Minister of Agriculture. It seems that preparations for the socialization of the earth are in full swing. Nevertheless, as it became known, not everyone in the Socialist-Revolutionary party shares Chernov's position to unite with Savinkov in a coalition. One of the prominent figures of the Socialist-Revolutionary party, Nikolai Avksentiev, declared the illegitimacy of the coalition and called on all self-respecting Socialist-Revolutionaries who consider themselves really socialists to refrain from voting for the draft laws of the NPRR."
rusdem.354.a:0 "A new ally from the Past."

rusdem.355.t:0 "Secret Meeting With the Left SRs"
rusdem.355.d:0 "According to rumors, a secret meeting was held in Petrograd between representatives of the NRPR and the left srs. After Chernov's refusal to cooperate, it seems that Savinkov's view fell on more radical former party members. Despite the fact that now an alliance between anarcho-syndicalists and popular Republicans seems simply impossible, it is quite likely that for the sake of overthrowing the power of oligarchs and aristocrats from the Senate, even such a radical alliance takes place.\n\nIn any case, it is still impossible to say unequivocally whether such an alliance will be possible or not."
rusdem.355.a:0 "Time will tell."

rusdem.356.t:0 "NRPR-PLSR Coalition?"
rusdem.356.d:0 "What seemed impossible yesterday has become a reality today. Prime Minister Savinkov announced an alliance between the NPRR and the PLSR in the name of protecting the achievements of February and democracy. Together with one of the leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, Steinberg, Savinkov announced the immediate termination of the bourgeois power of the Senate, the final socialization of the land and the democratization of power in the republic.\n\nIt is unknown how long this alliance will last, but the fact remains that the two radical parties have united to achieve their own goals."
rusdem.356.a:0 "A very unexpected alliance, indeed."

rusdem.357.t:0 "Spiridonova Denounces NRPR"
rusdem.357.d:0 "Today, the Central Committee of the PLSR, headed by Maria Spiridonova, provided the general public with a resonant statement about the inadmissibility of the seizure of power by Savinkov's NRPR.\n\nThe Central Committee said that earlier the prime Minister's party had invited the left SRS to join the united anti-capitalist revolutionary front in order to fight the dominance of the Senate. Such a proposal was regarded by the left Socialists-Revolutionaries as a provocation and a substitution of concepts. Spiridonova stated that the ideas of the NRPR completely contradict the goals of the Party of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries, and that nothing can justify the people's Republicans, even the struggle against capitalists and aristocrats."
rusdem.357.a:0 "We don't even need them."

rusdem.358.t:0 "The Russian Revolutionary Front"
rusdem.358.d.psr:0 "Today, Prime Minister Savinkov announced the establishment of the Russian Revolutionary Front - an alliance between the NRPR and the PSR for the sake of fighting the authoritarianism of the Senate, mired in corruption and thirst for power. The Russian Revolutionary Front will demand the immediate resignation of all senators who do not belong to the parties that are members of the RRF.\n\nThe Russian Revolutionary Front is fighting for the rights of peasants, for the rights of all Russian peoples! Against the dominance of German capital! For free and fair elections! Against the autocracy of the Senate!"

Savinkov noted that the program of his party, which honestly won the elections, is capable of helping the deteriorating economic situation, snatching the peasantry from the captivity of Kerensky's land reform, as well as destroying corruption among senators.\n\nSavinkov ended his speech with a quote: \"And while the senators, the servants of German capital, are sitting there, robbing our people, they should keep in mind that we will fight for the rights of the peasants! And if they do not voluntarily resign their mandates, we will regard this as a coup d'etat!\""
rusdem.359.a:0 "People, unite!"

rusdem.360.t:0 "The Solidarists Withdraw From NRPR"
rusdem.360.d:0 "The National Union of the New Generation party, or Solidarists, is a party organized recently by Russian youth who saw in Savinkov and his NRPR an excellent opportunity to promote their ideas. Together with other associations, such as Gorgulov's VNKPZ, the NSNP became part of the NRPR as a faction. Despite the fact that the NSNP was constantly suppressed under the influence of Savinkov's strong leadership, they considered it necessary to declare their withdrawal from the NRPR and the formation of a separate party.\n\nThis decision was made as a result of an open call on the part of Savinkov to overthrow the existing state institutions. Despite all the difficulties, and the fact that as a result of Kerensky's action, the Senate has become a stronghold of conservative forces, it is impossible to make such statements, especially in the run-up to the senate elections next year. The departure of the solidarists from the NRPR significantly affected the stability of the party, in addition to the fact that the People's Republicans lost a certain number of seats in the Duma and the Senate, Savinkov's reputation was damaged. However, he never intended to play democracy."
rusdem.360.a:0 "They were never true People's Republicans."

rusdem.361.t:0 "Savinkov Meets Kornilov"
rusdem.361.d:0 "General Lavr Kornilov is one of Boris Savinkov's old associates. Despite the fact that in the post-war period he moved away from politics and focused all his attention on the development of the armed forces, he and Savinkov remained in touch.\n\nFor several years, there have been rumors that Kornilov is ready to support Savinkov and his party in seizing power in the country. However, Kornilov is the head of the ROVS, and he still does not let go of connections with other generals, among whom there are many monarchists, and who do not particularly trust Savinkov. Kornilov will have to make a difficult choice, to support Savinkov in his upcoming fight against the Senate or to stay away, and this choice remains not obvious."
rusdem.361.a:0 "Will the meeting tell anything new?"

rusdem.362.t:0 "The Kornilov-Savinkov Alliance"
rusdem.362.d:0 "General Kornilov agreed to create a kind of alliance between the ROVS and the NRPR, openly supporting Savinkov and declaring the inadmissibility of destroying democracy in the country with the help of the Senate. His statement has already been regarded as thoughtless by many colleagues in the All-Military Union, including the director of the organization Ilyin, as well as such high-ranking officers as the vice-president of the ROVS Baron Wrangel and the head of the General Staff Anton Denikin.\n\nDespite the contradictions in the ROVS, now Kornilov's support is more important than ever for Savinkov, because the outcome of Russia's future depends on it."
rusdem.362.a:0 "Kornilov and Savinkov shall save holy Russia!"

rusdem.363.t:0 "The ROVS Won't Support Savinkov's Claims"
rusdem.363.d:0 "Today, the president of the ROVS, General Kornilov, together with the director of the organization, Ilyin, as well as Vice President Wrangel and Chief of the General Staff Denikin, made a joint statement that the Russian armed forces will act as a guarantor of peace and prosperity of Russian democracy. The Constitution, for which a lot of blood was shed in the civil war, should be preserved, and its observance is not subject to doubt.\n\nIn this regard, as Kornilov said, the prime minister of the country must respect the current Constitution and the law, and therefore has no right to dissolve the Senate."
rusdem.363.a:0 "Damn..."

rusdem.364.t:0 "'The All-Russian Ultimatum to the Senate'"
rusdem.364.d:0 "It seems that today is the X-day. Prime Minister Savinkov, speaking at a Duma meeting in the Tauride Palace today, ordered to lower two banners with the Russian tricolor behind his back, in the middle of which a crown of thorns and a sword were spread out.\n\nFrom the rostrum, Savinkov made a rather emotional speech, which he designated as "An All-Russian ultimatum to the Senate". In it, he said that on behalf of the majority of the Russian population who voted for him and his party, on behalf of the majority of people's representatives in the Duma who elected him prime minister, he calls on representatives of the upper house of parliament to immediately resign senatorial mandates within the next 5 days. Savinkov threatened that if the ultimatum is not fulfilled, the Senate will be dissolved by force with the use of the army, law enforcement agencies, the Fighting Organization of the NRPR, as well as initiative citizens who want to live in peace.\n\n'The senators will be expelled by popular anger. For all the vices committed against the Russian people, you will be punished!'"
rusdem.364.a:0 "Is this the beginning of the new Era?"

rusdem.365.t:0 "The Senators Resigns!"
rusdem.365.d:0 "Frightened by the ultimatum of the strongest party in the history of Russia, Senators from conservative parties resigned, fearing for their safety.\n\nFor the first time in the history of Russia, members of the upper house of parliament voluntarily resigned their powers for the sake of people, for the sake of freedom and the achievements of February. The success of the NRPR and Savinkov showed that only with the national support is peace and prosperity of Russia possible."
rusdem.365.a:0 "Long live Savinkov!"

rusdem.366.t:0 "The Senators Reject Ultimatum!"
rusdem.366.d:0 "The situation in the republic became tense as soon as it became known that the conservative senators refused the demands of the NRPR and declared that they would follow the Constitution.\n\nA statement was made by the representative of conservative senators, Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich, who declared Savinkov's demands unconstitutional and immoral, violating the rights and freedoms of citizens, including those with senatorial powers. In this regard, Dmitry Pavlovich called on the army and the people, as well as the Duma opposition to Savinkov, to unite for the sake of saving the republic from the coup of the NRPR and not to succumb to Savinkov's cheap populism."
rusdem.366.a:0 "Who he think he is?!"

rusdem.367.t:0 "National Revolution!"
rusdem.367.d:0 "After the Senators' rejection of the ultimatum's demands, it is time for serious changes. By order of Savinkov, BO-NRPR fighters were stationed in major Russian cities, primarily in Petrograd and Moscow, which, according to the Prime Minister, were convened to further protect the work of municipal and city administrative buildings.\n\nThe BO-NRPR actually seized the entrances and exits to the Tauride Palace in Petrograd, as well as to the Moscow City Duma. Armed patrols are marching through the streets. It seems that the country is slowly sliding into anarchy, but so far everything looks quite calm. Savinkov urged citizens not to go out if possible, as sabotage by Senators is possible.\n\nIn addition, today, for the first time in many decades, the latest issue of the morning newspaper was not published in Moscow, as the printing house was blocked by the BO-NRPR. While there is a situation of uncertainty in the country, we need to start acting."
rusdem.367.a:0 "The situation seems to be under control."

rusdem.368.t:0 "The Shameful Stigma Of Monarchism"
rusdem.368.d:0 "Today, the newspapers presented the appeal of Prime Minister Savinkov with the propaganda of People's Republicanism. In it, he harshly went through the monarchist senators, whom he literally accused of being enemies of the people. The monarchy is the last century, and the February Revolution put an end to this relic of the past. Savinkov urged the population to forget about the return of the monarchy and the throne to Russia, because this path will be disastrous. Having criticized monarchism, Savinkov also condemned the monarchist senators who hold the majority in the Senate and do not allow the most important reforms for the people to be adopted."
rusdem.368.a:0 "Another blow to the monarchists!"

rusdem.369.t:0 "The Senate Majority"
rusdem.369.d:0 "Now that the NPRR has a majority in the Senate, the new speaker of the Senate, a close friend of Savinkov, Dmitry Merezhkovsky, declared full support for the Prime Minister in his bill on merging the Prime-minister and President offices.\n\nThe following Bill, as has Merezhkovsky mentioned, is a revolutionary to the political system in Russia. By giving our Prime-Minister broad powers to govern the country, we will ensure the victory of people, at first, and, secondly, will finally deal with the Kerensky's legacy of a presidency elected by a puppet Senate."
rusdem.369.a:0 "So that what the NRPR wanted?"

rusdem.370.t:0 "Private Talk to the Constitutional Court"
rusdem.370.d:0 "Today it became known that some people meet with judges of the Constitutional Court during private conversations behind closed doors about the upcoming bill on combining the posts of Prime Minister and president. Despite the fact that many politicians have already dubbed this as undisguised lobbying and even bribery, today Savinkov spoke in the Duma, where he said that he opposes the corruption of officials, and private conversations were nothing more than consultations about the future bill.\n\nSavinkov also noted that if there is a majority in the Duma and the Senate, he does not need to lobby the Constitutional Court, since all the formal requirements for changing the constitution have already been achieved."
rusdem.370.a:0 "That sounds reasonable."

rusdem.371.t:0 "Savinkov's Address to the Constitutional Court"
rusdem.371.d:0 "Today, Prime Minister Savinkov addressed the judges of the Constitutional Court with an official statement that they are obliged to adopt amendments to the Constitution of the RDFR on the basis of the fact that the NRPR has popular support among the majority of the population. In case of refusal to accept the amendments, Savinkov promises to raise a popular uprising against illegitimate pro-German judges.\n\nDespite the fact that many politicians have already regarded Savinkov's speech as destructive to the foundations of the constitutional system of Russia, many citizens understand the need to adopt such a law in order to save the country from the chaos of Black Monday."
rusdem.371.a:0 "Does he hope that will work?"

rusdem.372.t:0 "The Constitutional Court Examines the Bill"
rusdem.372.d:0 "The Constitutional Court of [RUS.GetNameDef] has announced that as Savinkov's Bill requires changes in the Constitution, the Court will examine this case closely and and will make a decision on the admissibility of the adoption of such amendments or not."
rusdem.372.a:0 "Let us wait for the result."

rusdem.373.t:0 "The Constitutional Court Refused Amendments"
rusdem.373.d:0 "The Constitutional Court has rejected changes in the Constitution. Unfortunately, that is not the solution the prime-minister wanted, so he has announced the deployment of the Combat Squads and the beginning of the National Revolution."
rusdem.373.a:0 "Call the Combat Squads!"

rusdem.374.t:0 "The Constitutional Court Changes the Constitution"
rusdem.374.d:0 "The Constitutional Court has adopted changes in the Constitution. Savinkov will be soon sworn in as the President of Russia."
rusdem.374.a:0 "Get Ready."

rusdem.375.t:0 "Savinkov is Proclaimed the Vozhd"
rusdem.375.d:0 "Our actions were successful - now Savinkov has almost unlimited power. Now nothing can stop Savinkov and his ambitions to create a centralised, strong Russia."
rusdem.375.a:0 "Hail to Vozhd!"

rusdem.376.t:0 "Savinkov Deploys Combat Squads"
rusdem.376.d:0 "Today, Prime Minister Savinkov said that the NRPR is not going to give up and will not allow the country to plunge further into chaos. The combat detachments stationed in Moscow and Petrograd were ordered to seize the most important administrative buildings to seize power in the country. The same orders were received by the BO-NRPRR detachments in other cities.\n\nIt remains only to determine our most important priorities - what we should capture first in Petrograd."
rusdem.376.a:0 "Capture the Duma."
rusdem.376.b:0 "Capture the Senate instead - Duma won't fix anything."
rusdem.376.c:0 "Capture the Police Headquarters - so they won't bother us."
rusdem.376.e:0 "We need help of the Russian Army - and Kornilov." 

rusdem.377.t:0 "The Duma Captured"
rusdem.377.d:0 "The Combat Squads of the NRPR broke into the Tauride Palace, capturing it and announcing the dissolution of the Duma. Nevertheless, this step was perceived by Savinkov's opponents as reckless, given the majority of People's Republicans in parliament. The Duma building was surrounded by police officers who demanded to surrender."
rusdem.377.b:0 "Hold the deputies as hostages and ask the Police to put down weapons."
rusdem.377.c:0 "We need help of the Russian Army - and Kornilov."

rusdem.378.t:0 "The Senate Captured"
rusdem.378.d:0 "The NRPR Combat Squads broke into the Senate building, dissolving the current cabinet and arresting the monarchist senators. Despite the rather dangerous situation, the revolutionary people began to gather on the streets, demanding the resignation of the monarchists and the establishment of the power of the people's Republicans. Riots broke out in the city, but the police were able to break through to the Senate, surrounding it and demanding that the BO-NRPRR surrender."
rusdem.378.a:0 "Hold the senators as hostages and ask the Police to put down weapons."

rusdem.379.t:0 "The Police Started Shooting"
rusdem.379.d:0 "Despite the fact that we took high-ranking officials hostage, the police ignored our demands, demanding that they immediately stop the terror and surrender.

rusdem.382.t:0 "The Police Puts Their Weapons Down."
rusdem.382.d:0 "The police agreed to lower their weapons, and many policemen began to surrender under the pressure of the revolutionary people and the legitimately elected Prime Minister.

Many soldiers go over to the side of the people, leaving Kornilov's army without the best fighters of the fatherland.\n\nNevertheless, the situation is getting worse, turning into riots, armed clashes with the wounded. It seems that everything is going to a full-fledged war. However, everything now depends on Kornilov. Savinkov has already sent him an ultimatum demanding that he surrender and resign for the benefit of the people, before it's too late.

Frankly speaking, Savinkov hates leftists, and leftists hate Savinkov.\n\nAn unstable coalition will collapse at any moment, and in many respects the outcome of this event depends on Savinkov. On the one hand, he can already declare the collapse of the coalition, but this will entail an inevitable uprising of socialists against his power, and in key industrialized regions of the country. On the other hand, you can try to preserve the coalition by making small concessions to the SRs."

Filled with authoritarian politicians who do not want to carry out reforms, the Senate remains a relic of the past. There is no doubt for the government that the Senate should be disbanded and replaced by a State Council, presumably consisting of representatives of all Russian regions. In addition, the government believes that it is necessary to change the procedure for electing the president, either by making it popular or by limiting the presidential power."

There was a final break between our party and the right-wing Kadets of Nabokov, who were firmly entrenched in the opposition. Relations also deteriorated with other socialist parties that opposed the law, namely the Mensheviks and the NSP.

Relations also improved with other socialist parties that opposed the law, namely the Mensheviks and the NSP. On the contrary, Savinkov's NRPR has worsened relations with us, because the socialization of the land has not been carried out.

In addition, land under private ownership would be subject to an additional luxury tax.\n\nVoting among the members of the Central Committee was mainly on the side of the right-wing Kadets, but perhaps Chernov's authority can play a role in the vote. Despite all the decentralization of the PSR, its leader still had little influence on decision-making."

Cooperation with the left srs of course only increased suspicions, and many politicians began to hear speeches about an attempt to usurp power on the part of the SRS. Most of all, such rhetoric was of course from the monarchists and conservatives, as well as members of the ROVS.\n\nIt is possible that the union of Socialists-Revolutionaries will put an end to the showdowns within the Russian socialist movement, however, it is possible that this is only the beginning of the complete end of narodism."

rusdem.425.d:0 "The Siberian Oblastnichestvo is a socio-political movement that aimed at either the complete separation of Siberia from Russia, or the granting of broad autonomy to this territory. They received their greatest flourishing during the Civil War, entering various governments of the white forces. However, with the end of the civil war, the oblasts did not receive full autonomy, and Siberia remained under the control of federal forces.\n\nEverything changed in 1925, when a number of regional officials supported Kolchak and announced the creation of the East Siberian Autonomy, which became part of the Far Eastern Republic of Transamura. As we know, Kolchak tried to maintain the balance of power and promised the Oblasts to grant autonomy as soon as he regained control over the whole of Russia. However, now that Kerensky is gone, we can consider a bill on granting autonomy to Siberia, thereby increasing our support among the regionalists and residents of Siberia.\n\nThe project implies the creation of a full-fledged autonomy on the entire territory of Siberia with its own government and parliament - the Siberian Regional Duma."

The return of the united Socialist-Revolutionary party will have a favorable impact not only on the party itself, but also will allow creating a strong ruling coalition.\n\nThat is why today in Petrograd, Prime Minister Zenzinov met with Boris Savinkov himself. The former socialist revolutionary, now the charismatic leader of the NRPR, and the prime minister had a long conversation and discussed key issues of creating a coalition. Among the disadvantages, experts say, is the role of the leader of the organization, which Savinkov will undoubtedly claim, so it is not a fact that the coalition will be stable."

Ardent opponents of each other in parliament, the PSR and the NRPR announced the creation of a parliamentary coalition. We can be sure that if the PSR had any obligations with other parties, they are definitely terminated, and relations are spoiled. Despite the fact that the majority of the members of the NRPR are former social revolutionaries, the ideologies of the two parties differ, which means that each party will pull the blanket of state administration over itself. With the creation of the parliamentary coalition, new ministers from the NRPR were invited to the Cabinet of Ministers, who took the chairs of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Internal Affairs, so it seems that now all state affairs are under the control of Savinkov."

rusdem.428.d:0 "Today, a government decree was adopted on the dissolution of the BO-NRPR, a paramilitary unit of the NRPR. If at first this news was perceived positively by the public, it soon became known that the militants were massively transferring to the official state service in the Okhrana and the federal security service, which is engaged in the protection of state facilities and senior officials.\n\nThus, the BO-NRPR were not abolished, but rather reformed, but we hope that the government knows what it is doing."

A number of high-ranking generals, mainly members of the so-called "Wrangel Clique", were dismissed. Despite the fact that the president of the ROVS, Lavr Kornilov, condemned this decision, in general, the reshuffle went smoothly.

Republicanism and Narodism became the official ideology of the party. Despite the fact that the NRPR and the PSR are now united, there are still factions in it, as before. Therefore, many critics of the association claim that the association between parties is formal."

rusdem.432.t:0 "False Socialists-Revolutionaries"
rusdem.432.d:0 "It seems that the government has launched an attack against the NRPR. Propaganda posters have appeared in many Russian cities, postulating that the NRPR are false socialists-revolutionaries who are trying to establish a dictatorship and a cult of Savinkov's personality.\n\nAfter the NRPR almost unanimously supported the law on the socialization of the land, it seems that the PSR is trying to avoid a sharp increase in sympathy for this party and seize the initiative in its own hands as the party that proposed this law.\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned slogans, among the posters you can find such inscriptions as: 'The NRPR wants to take away your land', 'There is only one party of socialists-revolutionaries', as well as 'We gave you freedom, they are trying to take it away!'. Each poster depicted the logo of the red sun of the Socialists-Revolutionaries and a molten sword with a crown of thorns."

Despite the fact that previously it was believed that the coalition exists only at the expense of the authority of Kerensky, who can hardly be called an ideological socialist-revolutionary, since then the Kadet party itself has split, and its left wing under the leadership of Nikolai Nekrasov wants to establish a strong pro-republican and pro-federalist union.\n\nIt is quite possible that the coalition will not last long, but it is impossible to say unequivocally about its imminent failure."

The plan provides for removing the right of the Senate to appoint the president and oversee his activities, transferring these powers to the government and the Duma. Thus, the president will actually be appointed by the current government, which will avoid conflict situations between these two institutions of executive power. The Duma will oversee the activities of the president, that is, the president will no longer be accountable to the Senate.\n\nIn addition, the Senate reform will abolish the socio-demographic qualification for senate elections, making them nationwide. The right to appoint 50 Senators will remain with the president.\n\nIn general, the Senate will become more democratic, and will truly represent the interests of citizens, and our political system will become even more free and open."

rusdem.438.d:0 "Taking into account the recent events in the life of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, the Central Committee was re-elected today, the leadership of which was taken by Nikolai Avksentiev, replacing Viktor Chernov as chairman of the Central Committee. In connection with this appointment, Avksentiev announced the adoption of a new party code, as well as the replacement of some ideological principles in connection with adaptation to a new era in the history of the party.\n\nSo, Avksentiev said that since the revolutionary ideology no longer symbolizes the party, its name will be changed to the "Party of Socialist Reformists". Avksentiev suggested that, in this way, the party will be able to attract even more supporters and show peaceful and democratic intentions. Since the party's abbreviation will remain PSR, it will not lose supporters. In addition, Avksentiev said that the ideology of the party will remain the same, but the party will move away from the exclusively peasant agenda in connection with the disappearance of the peasantry as a class in order to represent wider segments of the population.\n\nThe decision of the Central Committee was massively criticized by the center-left of the party, whose unofficial leaders are Gerstein and Volsky, to the point that many of them chose to leave the party. According to sources, many of that minority have already joined more" left-wing " peasant parties, namely, joined the PLSR and the NSP."

The deep party split, which has lasted since the civil war, does not allow us to effectively start state reforms.\n\nAt the moment, the leader of the party is already quite elderly Alexander Potresov, one of the founders of the RSDRP and an ardent supporter of reformism. Under his auspices, the party became a key agitator of workers ' rights and many Mensheviks were appointed to key positions, and trade unions became almost completely controlled by the Mensheviks. As the head of the party, Potresov established contacts with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Kadets, and became their close ally.\n\nAt the same time, until 1927, the Central Committee of the RSDRP was dominated by the left Menshevik internationalists under the leadership of Raphael Abramovich, a member of the Bund, who openly cooperate with the Third International. In connection with the death of Kerensky and the victory in the elections, it seems that it is necessary to convene a new congress of the Central Committee and determine who should be in charge."

However, the Jews, of whom there are quite a lot on the territory of our country, still do not have any autonomy.\n\nThe leadership of the Bund, including Prime Minister Abramovich himself, consider it important and necessary to adopt a law on Jewish cultural and national autonomy. Thus, it is proposed not to create a certain territorial autonomy, due to the widespread settlement of Jews, but to grant the Bund powers to implement cultural and educational policy in the interests of the Jewish population, primarily the working class."

Together with Plekhanov, another founder of Menshevism, he founded the group "Liberation of Labor", was one of the leaders of the Second International.\n\nAnd these are not the only achievements of Askelrod. It was he who achieved the unity of the party in the years after the civil war and thanks to him, internal party differences have not been so strong for the last almost 10 years. Askelrod, an ideological supporter of reformism and an alliance with the bourgeoisie, building a state where workers and capitalists can live in peace, laid the foundations for the successful rule of the Menshevik party.\n\nThe memory of him and his achievements should be perpetuated, and that is why the government initiated the renaming of one of the central streets in Moscow to Askelrod Street."

rusdem.469.d:0 "A common misconception about the Soviets is that they will definitely be filled with Bolsheviks, who will definitely unleash a civil war. It is understandable, but the Councils themselves as a system of collective management are one of the best types of local self-government. Since the Civil War, there have been many councils in Russia, but they are all characterized by different structures and limited in their decisions.\n\nThe Mensheviks ' proposal is to create a federal system of councils of different levels, which will be formed first into municipalities, and then into a federal legislative body of each region. This will give the regions more autonomy in the adoption of local laws and create a fair system of representation of the population."

rusdem.470.t:0 "The Senate Reform"
rusdem.470.d:0 "According to the system of Federal Councils, the current state of the Senate is inadequate, harmful and harmful to Russian democracy. Thus, the deputies of the RSDRP announced a reform of the Senate, which will get rid of presidential senators and instead expand the number of regional senators to 75, as well as elected senators to 75.\n\nThus, half of the Senate will be elected by the population, and the other half by the legislative regional bodies, also elected by the population. It turns out that the Senate will become fully democratically elected, which will save us from the authoritarian system partially operating in the upper house of parliament.\n\n"

Since many of those who are now in the government and the Central Committee are representatives of left Menshevism, they decided to establish a separate party - the Russian Socialist Workers' Party of Interationalists, or RSRPI.\n\nThese same people had already attempted to create this party, even during the Civil War, when they wanted to support the Bolsheviks, but soon the Reds finally lost, and the RSRPI was never able to form itself into a separate party. Now it was her turn. The citizens of Russia should know that our party stands for workers ' socialism and internationalism, which will be officially reflected in our name."

rusdem.502.d:0 "The unfinished land reform, according to Nekrasov, undoubtedly hinders the normal development of the country, and first of all, the majority of the peasantry. However, the full socialization of the land will not happen. Instead, as the Prime Minister suggested, normal capitalist relations will develop in the village, as well as broad control over the protection of the land rights of peasants will be deployed. In this regard, the National Agrarian Fund will also be created, from which peasant allotments will be subsidized annually, developing agriculture and securing a good harvest."
rusdem.502.a:0 "A good solution."

rusdem.503.t:0 "Protection of Workers' Rights"
rusdem.503.d:0 "The big problem of Russia since the time of the Bolsheviks is the question of workeres. Despite the fact that most of the workers' rights were enshrined in the Constitution, for a long time the agrarian party of the Socialist-Revolutionaries was in power, which did little to support the proletariat. The Nekrasov government intends to correct this mistake by guaranteeing the full right of workers to strike. In addition, the KDP intends to seriously deal with the capitalists - owners of factories, and in case of excesses, immediately dismiss the managers. The working day will be reduced to 8 hours, and workers' salaries will be increased, largely due to budget cuts for the police and the army, which, although they also require development and attention from the state, do not need it so much at the moment."
rusdem.503.a:0 "The workers should be protected."

rusdem.504.t:0 "Universal Suffrage for Senate Elections"
rusdem.504.d:0 "As you know, now the electoral law for the elections to the Senate allows people over 30 years old with a higher education and a special social status (former aristocracy) or personal wealth to take part in voting for 50 people's senators. The Nekrasov government plans to change this measure by amending the electoral law and making the elections of senators nationwide by analogy with the elections to the Duma. Such a measure will be able to increase the effectiveness of popular representation in the upper house of parliament, and moreover, will prepare the ground for further senate reform - namely, the abolition of presidential senators."
rusdem.504.a:0 "Great!"

rusdem.505.t:0 "The Progressive Party"
rusdem.505.d:0 "The Progressive Party of the Russian Empire was rather not a party, but a group of moderate Russian liberals. Its most prominent members were the Don entrepreneur Ivan Efremov, the Moscow industrialist Alexander Konovalov and the businessman Pavel Ryabushinsky.\n\nThe Progressive Party was supposed to become a major party uniting Russian entrepreneurs, but after the February Revolution, the party finally collapsed, and its members, including Prime Minister Nekrasov himself, tried to establish a new party, but soon abandoned these attempts.\n\nA lot of time has passed since that moment, and progressives have mostly joined the Kadet party, taking a centrist position in it. However, unlike Nabokov, who leans towards a constitutional monarchy, progressives favor a federal republic with a strong president. Nekrasov believes that it is necessary to preserve the unity of the party, and therefore the progressive Konovalov should be invited to the government."

rusdem.506.t:0 "Nabokov Retires"
rusdem.506.d:0 "Today it became known that almost 70-year-old Vladimir Nabokov, one of the founders of the Kadet party, announced his retirement. He has been promoting constitutional monarchy and market liberalism for many years, but now a new person will take his place. And despite everything, it seems that this person will be Alexander Konovalov - a progressive and entrepreneur, who, unlike his predecessor, stands not for a constitutional monarchy, but for a strong presidential power. However, since he takes the place of the Minister of Economy, it seems that the Kadet party will become even more unified."
rusdem.506.a:0 "Good news that the party is unified."

rusdem.507.t:0 "Backward Judicial System"
rusdem.507.d:0 "The Russian judicial system is undoubtedly outdated and needs to be changed as soon as possible. The fact is that in practice, the judicial reform of 1864, built under the tsar and the aristocracy, continues to operate, as a result of which the masses of the people remain largely defenseless. Despite the fact that the judicial system was changed after the Constituent Assembly, the changes were largely insignificant. The judicial system remained too cumbersome and inconvenient, as well as essentially open to corruption. It is necessary to develop a new clear judicial system with a certain hierarchy and levels, as well as to federalize this system by combining various regional and district courts under a single Supreme Court of the Russian Republic."

With the authoritarian senate gone, today a truly democratic and free Duma and its elected Prime Minister and President are leading Russia into a bright future. The successful reforms of Nekrasov and his 'New Tactics' helped the Russian Republic to become what it should have been 15 years ago. The era of the plutocratic tsars and Kerenshchiny has passed into oblivion. From now on, our legal, free and democratic state will be an example for other countries, especially Eastern European ones."
rusdem.508.d.nosenatereform:0 "Despite the fact that the Duma failed to win and carry out the reform of the Senate, many democratic reforms were undertaken and carried out. Their effectiveness will still be appreciated by time and future generations. Our republic cannot be called truly parliamentary, because the power of the President and his electability by the Senate are still preserved. Regardless of the current situation, we should always hope for the best, and do everything in the present to create a successful future."

He began his speech by describing his strategy, calling it an 'Old Deal', apparently in order to ridicule Nekrasov's 'New Tactics'.\n\nDespite his determination, such an outburst did not go unnoticed by the left wing of the party, which criticized the prime minister for worsening the image of the party and introducing a split, simultaneously condemning his preference for outdated ideas of a consensual monarchy. In any case, Nabokov will probably soon do something to promote the ideas of a constitutional monarchy, otherwise his government will be doomed."

Therefore, we have two proposals under consideration.\n\nThe first is to introduce progressive taxation, which will allow the poor to give a smaller part of their income, and the rich to pay more taxes. Such a proposal, of course, will not suit the rich, but it will suit the majority of the population.\nThe second is to reduce the income tax to 14%. It will also satisfy the poor, who will pay less than they do now, and at the same time the popularity of our government will greatly increase. Despite the fact that the budget will suffer from such a reduction, we hope to recapture these costs with the help of fiscal reform."

rusdem.523.d:0 "For many centuries, a simple Russian peasant was a peasant, in particular, a serf, actually a slave of a feudal lord - and then a capitalist. When Alexander II abolished serfdom and granted freedom to the peasants, Tsarist Russia forced them to pay taxes and pay debts for land. Then the Bolsheviks came. Having taken the land from the people, they gave it to the people, and then the war began and they took away their last crop, famine and death began. Then came the era of Kerensky, who decided not to take the land from ordinary peasants completely. He allowed them to work on the land, cultivate it and grow food. But at the same time, he deprived millions of other peasants who lived near the cities where the capitalists seized the land of this right. And, finally, the era of the Cadets has come. A fair and honest era, where people were given the right to privatize land, where the government began to control monopolists, and gave the peasants the right to enrich themselves.\n\nThere are no more peasants. This era has finally sunk into oblivion. Now there is a Russian Farmer-entrepreneur who feeds Europe and Russia. An entrepreneur who receives fair money for his work, who sets the price for his services and goods himself. This is the triumph of capitalism - this is the triumph of democracy."

The party, like the other Russian parties, is divided, and each of the leading persons in the party is playing his own game.\n\nOn the one hand, the formal leader of the party, Vasily Shulgin, is a convinced monarchist, a former Black-Hundredist, who, however, is not inherent in chauvinism. His main goal is to restore the constitutional monarchy and create a large right-wing coalition.\n\nOn the other hand, the informal leader of the party, Dmitry Romanov, although he is one of the main contenders for the Russian throne, has his own power as the main goal. He is not close to a constitutional monarchy, or rather, he does not trust the masses and seeks to strengthen the power of the Senate. But in this case, it will be necessary to rely on the pro-republican Eurasianists.\n\nThere is also a third player, Felix Yusupov. A close associate of Dmitry Romanov, he is convinced of the need to transfer power to large capital, oligarchs, which he himself is to some extent.

rusdem.527.d:0 "Vasily Shulgin, once one of the best speakers of the Duma, a man who took the abdication of the monarchy into his hands and always tried to restore it, lost.\n\nAlready in the 1920s, he became a political outsider, but he managed to unite all the conservative and right-wing organizations in the country and create an opposition to Kerensky. The opposition, which will soon occupy the Senate and will dictate its terms. But everything comes to an end. And the referendum on the restoration of the monarchy, so desired by Shulgin, failed. Like Shulgin himself, now cursed and hated by everyone.\n\nWe can only hope that the new prime minister will lead the party out of the crisis."
rusdem.527.a:0 "Damned fool."

rusdem.528.t:0 "Neo-Stolypinist Approach"
rusdem.528.d:0 "The Stolypin agrarian reforms were a series of changes to Imperial Russia's agricultural sector instituted during the tenure of Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin, who our party considers to be one of the greatest politicians ever lived in Russia.\n\nStolypin believed that tying the peasants to their own private land-holdings would produce profit-minded and politically conservative farmers like those living in parts of western Europe by abolising the Obschina system, that tied the peasants into socialist cooperatives and poverty.\n\nWhy Stolypin has tragically died long ago, his legacy lives. The Neo-Stolypinist appoarch in agrarian policy is now one of the headliners of the VNS party programme. We shall once again abolish any existing Obschinas, subsidize the agricultural sector to develop large-scale individual farming and introduce affordables credits for peasants in the Rosselkhozbank - Russian Agricultral Bank."

rusdem.530.d:0 "Many years ago, the Black Hundreds were an influential political group that fought for the rights of the Russian population and sought to preserve the autocratic tsar. Shulgin himself belonged to the Black Hundreds, although he was not so radical and he did not have anti-Semitic views. However, he knew many Black Hundreds personally, and now, having come to power, their experience and knowledge can be useful.\n\nThe RNSMA, the Russian People's Union named after Mikhail the Archangel, led by Purishkevich, is now nothing more than a marginal group of essentially counterculturists, radical monarchist nationalists who advocate building a great empire."

rusdem.531.d:0 "The ban on trade unions was only the first step on the way to gaining real independence for our country. The socialist parties are destroying and destroying our culture, trying to equalize everyone and depriving the best minds of the fatherland of the opportunity to develop themselves. The foreign fiction of Marx, Sorel and other founders of modern socialism are harmful books that corrupt the minds and enslave millions of people.\n\nThat is why today the government, together with the president, announced the adoption of an emergency decree on "Social Protection". About protection from malicious ideologies that try to desecrate our traditional values and culture. The text of the decree announced the immediate termination of the activities of the PLSR, PSR, NSP and RSDRP parties, their inclusion in the list of organizations banned in Russia with the seizure of all their property. This decree also refers to the dismissal of all officials associated with these parties and their lustration, that is, a ban on participating in political activities.

This is the new Russian conservatism - to put politics on the scales and achieve balance.

rusdem.551.d:0 "In order to hold a referendum on the restoration of the monarchy, it is necessary to make several initial decisions, the main of which is to put the relevant issue to a vote in the Duma and the Senate. Without this action, we are doomed to failure."

rusdem.553.t:0 "The Monarchy Referendum Bill Fails!"
rusdem.553.d:0 "Today, the law on holding the monarchy referendum has failed, and it seems there are no legal ways we can ensure it to be held. This is a disaster for the current political party and its prime-minister with it losing a great ammount of support and popularity."
rusdem.553.a:0 "A disaster!"

rusdem.554.t:0 "The Referendum in 3 Months!"
rusdem.554.d:0 "The date of the referendum was announced-in 3 months. A lot has to be done during this time, and our main task now is to achieve an increase in the popularity of the monarchy among the population, as well as a high turnout. If the turnout is less than 50%, the referendum will be considered invalid."
rusdem.554.a:0 "Everything should go smooth."

rusdem.555.t:0 "Shulgin's Suggestion"
rusdem.555.d:0 "Vasily Shulgin, an inveterate monarchist and leader of the VNS, today addressed the top party leadership and shared his proposal for a new candidate for the Russian throne. In his opinion, after the abdication of Nicholas II and the confusion in the order of succession that arose as a result of all the events, there is no urgent need to restore the Romanov dynasty.\n\nAlthough Shulgin formally supports Roman Petrovich as a legitimate candidate for the tsarist throne, he sees an equally important figure in the framework of rallying the people and restoring a strong government... Pyotr Wrangel! According to him, it is Wrangel who is able to save Russia from a catastrophe, and his popularity among both the population and the army will contribute to the stability of the government.\n\nAs Shulgin said, he had already had a conversation with Wrangel himself on this issue, and the Black Baron was not against it if it was necessary to save Russia."
rusdem.555.a:0 "Wrangel is the best candidate."
rusdem.555.b:0 "The Romanovs have more rights to the throne."

rusdem.556.t:0 "Choosing the Candidate"
rusdem.556.d:0 "One of the most basic issues of the referendum is not so much the restoration of the monarchy itself, but who exactly will be the new Emperor of All-Russia.\n\nAfter the murder of Nicholas II and his family, as well as his brother Mikhail Alexandrovich, opinions about who should lead the dynasty were divided. Approximately 40% support Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich and his heirs as a contender for the throne. Opponents also refer to the fact that his marriage was not recognized by Nicholas II, or there is no clear confirmation of this.\n\nThe second main contender for the throne is the current speaker of the Senate, Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich, who, unlike Kirill, has no legal obstacles to the rights to the throne. However, it symbolizes the old aristocratic system and is not so popular with the masses.\n\nIn third place is the young prince Vsevolod Ioannovich, who is barely 20 years old, but at the same time enjoys wide popularity among the population as a young aristocrat who never lived under the tsarist autocracy. The fourth candidate for the throne, Prince Roman Petrovich, is also competing with Vsevolod Ioannovich, who is also quite young and ambitious. Prince Andrey Alexandrovich, patron of the Maltese Order of Orthodox Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, closes the trinity of young candidates"

Tsarevna Anastasia... However, her legitimacy is zero, since none of the representatives of the dynasty really recognizes her as the daughter of the last king.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, other candidates may arise."

rusdem.559.d:0 "The Russian All-Military Union has officially announced its support of the chosen candidate to the Russian Throne. The announcement was made jointly by Ivan Ilyin, the ideologue of the ROVS and its current public relations director, and vice-president Pyotr Wrangel. The announcement stated that the candidacy of [GetRussianMonarchCandidate] best suits the renewed age of Russian Imperalism and that the elected Senate and Duma together with the Tsar will make up a good and long story of cooperation."
rusdem.559.a:0 "The Monarchists of Russia, unite!"

rusdem.560.t:0 "The Romanovs Criticize the Candidate Choice"
rusdem.560.d:0 "Members of the Imperial House of Romanov declared that the chosen candidate at the referendum does not correspond at all to the laws on succession to the throne, nor to common sense. The split that exists in the imperial house on the issue of succession to the throne, the rejection of morganatic marriages, has long divided the Romanovs into those who support the line of Kirill Vladimirovich, and those who advocate other branches.\n\nNow that the heir to the throne has been officially elected, it seems that the house of Romanov is divided as never before, and in the future, we may face the consequences of this split."
rusdem.560.a:0 "Well..."

rusdem.561.t:0 "The Romanovs Question the Candidate Choice"
rusdem.561.d:0 "Despite the fact that in fact George was the recognized son of Mikhail Alexandrovich, he was granted the title of Prince, this does not negate the fact that he was an illegitimate child. If we proceed from the fact that Mikhail was de jure the last emperor of Russia, his son, of course, may have some rights to the throne. Ultimately, the opinions of a member of the House of Romanov on this matter differ, but most of them agree that there are candidates with great rights to the throne."

rusdem.563.t:0 "The Socialists Protest the Referendum"
rusdem.563.d:0 "As expected, it is not surprising that all the socialist parties, without exception, have protested against the holding of a referendum, which, in their opinion, will put an end to honest politics in Russia. The Socialists announced strikes, protests and called on all honest citizens to vote against the restoration of the monarchy, scaring them with the return of autocracy, the triumph of the capitalists and the oppression of the peasants and workers.\n\nWe must organize propaganda that the words of socialists are fiction, since under a constitutional monarchy they will still have the same rights and duties, and the role of the monarch will be symbolic."
rusdem.563.a:0 "Organise monarchist propaganda."

rusdem.564.t:0 "The General Public Endorses Young Prince"
rusdem.564.d:0 "In general, we can record an increase in sympathy towards the monarchy from the side of society, which can be attributed to the fact that the candidate we have chosen is young. The positive image in the media created by his supporters really helps to increase the popularity of the referendum, and it seems that even the monarchy itself."
rusdem.564.a:0 "That's great!"

rusdem.565.t:0 "Savinkov Denounces Referendum"
rusdem.565.d:0 "The Republican People's Party of Russia has declared the illegitimacy of the referendum. According to Boris Savinkov, the issue of the monarchy was resolved at the Constituent Assembly, a popularly elected body that decided that Russia is a republic and the corresponding Constitution was adopted.\n\nHe called the restoration of the Monarchy an illegal action that violates the stability of the country and its constitution. Savinkov urged people not to go to the vote, as it is not legitimate, and also called on the government to immediately cancel the referendum, or else they will face 'popular anger'."
rusdem.565.a:0 "Who he is to dictate us rules?"

rusdem.566.t:0 "Republican Propaganda"
rusdem.566.d:0 "No matter how much we want to remove all the pro-republican posters, they still exist. It is quite difficult to overshadow the propaganda that the Republicans have deployed, because all socialist parties and organizations, as well as Savinkovites, are engaged in it. Posters are trying to make the king an image of a villain, and the monarchy - a plague that consumes peoples. In addition, they often appeal to the past experience of autocracy. Vasily Shulgin was also criticized, who, despite all his progressiveness, is still accused after so many years of being a Black Hundred and a chauvinist who dreams of returning serfdom."
rusdem.566.a:0 "We must put more effort into our own propaganda."

rusdem.567.t:0 "Rigging the Results?"
rusdem.567.d:0 "The referendum is rapidly approaching, and many of the staff seem dissatisfied with the expected result and fear their loss. Anyway, the loss will really cost the initiators of the referendum dearly, up to the complete failure of the government and the disappearance of the monarchist parties from the Senate and the Duma. In order to avoid this kind of crisis, some (we will not name their names) proposed to fake the results of the referendum in order to ensure the victory of the monarchists."

POLITICS_ODINETS_DESC:0 "Once one of the leaders of the Labour Group, a social-democratic political party of Russia, Dmitriy Odinets became a well-known face in politics only after the February Revolution. On the instructions of the Provisional Government, in August 1917, he moved to Kiev and was appointed there a Deputy Secretary General of National Affairs, and then — Minister of Great Russian Affairs in the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic. He left this post after Hetman Skoropadsky came to power. During the Hetmanate, he was elected chairman of the Kiev committee of the "Union of the Revival of Russia" and stayed there until the end of the Russian Civil War.\n\nIn 1920 Odinets moved back to Russia to find his party dissolved, and Boris Savinkov, as the only political figure Odinets believed could rule Russia. Soon he became his close confederate and ally, becoming one of the members of the Senate from NRPR in 1934.\n\nNow, elected as President of Russia, Odinets understands that his term will end as soon as Savinkov will merge the offices of Prime-Minister and President to become the only ruler himself."

RUS_LAW_MERGE_PM_PRESIDENT_desc:0 "\n\nThe NRPR deputies have suggested a rather controversial proposition: merge the posts of the President and Head of Government. While this decision will be greatly protested by some parties in the Duma, Savinkov's ambitions won't go anywhere.\n§RNOTE: As this Bill will require changes to the Constitution, the Bill should be accepted by 2/3 of the Depities.§!"
RUS_LAW_NEP_desc:0 "\n\nThe NSP deputies suggest we should introduce the NEP - New Economic Policy, a package of reforms, that will eventually lead to establishment of a mixed economy, consisting of private ownership and planned economy. NSP believes that it will greatly improve our economy as well as balance inequality between proletariat and bourgeoisie."
RUS_LAW_PSR_SOCIALIZATION_OF_LAND_desc:0 "\n\nThe most ambitious plan of the PSR, partially implemented by Kerensky has a vital meaning to our country. For the long centuries rich landowners had exploited those who worked on these lands. We must finish this plan - make Russian Lands a common property of all Russian citizens. Thus, the management of the land shall be provided by special local councils."

In addition, land under private ownership would be subject to an additional luxury tax"
RUS_LAW_LOCAL_PARLIAMENTS_desc:0 "\n\nRussia is a big country and lacks more federalization. We are a Federation on paper - we should be a Federation in reality. We must create local parliaments in every region and expand the powers of those already existing to make sure that every voice is heard."

RUS_LAW_AGRICULTURAL_COMMITTEE_desc:0 "\n\nRight now the land in the regions where it is socialized is governmend by local council. However, there is no centralized governmental body that ensures that these councils manage the land in a right way.

RUS_LAW_SENATE_PSR_KDP_REFORM_desc:0 "\n\nThe Senate Reform, proposed jointly by PSR and KDP deputies will transfer the right to appoint President to the Government and the right to exercise supervision over President to the Duma.

RUS_LAW_PRESIDENT_PSR_KDP_REFORM_desc:0 "\n\nThe idea, proposed jointly by some PSR and most of KDP deputies is to make the President elected by the population, instead of the Senate.

RUS_LAW_ABOLISH_SENATE_desc:0 "\n\nA rather radical idea, proposed by the internationalist wing of the RSDRP is to completely abolish the Senate, because of its uselessness. The President should be appointed directly by the Parliament."

RUS_Senate_Duma_Conflict_Decisions_desc:0 "§OThe Russian political system is imperfect.§!\n\nThe reform of the §CSenate§! in 1925, carried out by §YKerensky§!, led to the fact that the order of election to the upper house of parliament was changed, as a result of which it became a stronghold of conservative and authoritarian forces.

With a majority in the §CSenate§!, conservatives can elect their own president.\n\n§RThere will be only one winner in this conflict.§!\n\nCurrent §CSenate§!

#rusdem.10.t:0 "PLSR Proposes Syndicalist Bill"

The industrial enterprises should be given to the autonomous Labour Collectives, united into a Federation of Syndicates. The consumption should be organized through the Cooperative Unions, united in the Federation of Cooperatives. The NSP, led by Bukharin, however, strongly disapproved of the idea, arguing that such radical changes to the society can be very harmful. Nevertheless, the Bill is in the Duma, and the voting will begin soon."

#rusdem.13.t:0 "New Economic Policy"
#rusdem.13.d:0 "Today, NSP deputies have introduced the bill called \"New Economic Policy\". Nikolay Bukharin, leader of the NSP, suggests that we should create a mixed economy: private property with planned socialist economy. He believes that this will help to unite village and city, improve the effeciency of the production and prove that socialism can coexist with capitalism. The only thing Bukharin did not mention is that he believes that NEP is a provisional measure needed for the complete socialist transition."

#rusdem.14.t:0 "Village Communes"
#rusdem.14.d:0 "Today, The PLSR deputies suggest the second part of the plan: create village communes - agricultural cooperatives. The farmers and peasants will share the labour and land and work together to ensure our future."

#rusdem.15.t:0 "Support the Kulaks"
#rusdem.15.d:0 "Who are the Kulaks? The NSP deputies state that Kulaks are rich peasant or farmers. Nikolay Bukharin believes that though kulaks are considered exploitators of the working class can be very useful for the government. By ensuring that Kulaks earn a lot of money, we will establish strong ties between our government and peasantry and between peasantry and workers."

#rusdem.16.t:0 "Strengthen Trade Unions"
#rusdem.16.d:0 "The PLSR deputies are fully committed to the idea that Trade Unions need more authority as they secure workers' rights as nobody else in the country. Though Bukharin and Tsereteli remain skeptical about giving much more power to trade unions, they are likely to accept this idea."

#rusdem.17.t:0 "Support Trade Unions"
#rusdem.17.d:0 "Bukharin himself believes that giving too much power to Trade Unions can get out of conrol. His approach considers that government is good at securing workers' rights, but we should probably give more money to Trade Unions to win their trust."

#rusdem.18.t:0 "Municipal Councils"
#rusdem.18.d:0 "The RSDRP suggest we should create municipal councils: firstly, to improve local self-government; secondly, to ensure that workers are well represented; thirdly, our country is big and complex - and we need help at local levels."

#rusdem.19.t:0 "Agricultural Security Agency"
#rusdem.19.d:0 "Irakliy Tseretely believes that Russia has a stong agricultural potential: our country can feed whole Europe and help our close neighbours. To ensure that agriculture develops and prospers, we should create a special Agency to supervise peasants and farmers."

#rusdem.20.t:0 "Nationalize Railroads"

RUS_communists:0 "PLSR/NSP Coalition Elected"
RUS_communists_desc:0 "Surprisingly, the popularity of the NSP and PLSR have both grown to the point that through begrudging cooperation, these two parties have been able to charm the masses and win a majority in the elections by forming an uneasy coalition. Despite their differing attitudes and plans for Russia, the NSP and PLSR are now glued together at the hip - each an independent head pulling the shared body in a different direction. Now let us see if this uneasy alliance can last."

RUS_Coalition_Only_In_Name:0 "A Coalition Only In Name"
RUS_Coalition_Only_In_Name_desc:0 "Despite the coalition between the NSP of Bukharin and PLSR of Spiridonova securing our democratic election, our cooperation is far from harmonious or peaceful. Ministers from both parties chomp at the bit, frothing at the mouth in an attempt to get their way over the wishes of their new ‘allies.’ Inter-party violence is rising, and cooperation seems like a dead ideal. It would seem that no matter what these two groups do, one will inevitably rise to dominate the other, for this coalition was little more than a stepping stool on the way to power, and both groups realize it."

RUS_Trade_Unions_Discussion:0 "Debate on the Future of Trade Unions"
RUS_Trade_Unions_Discussion_desc:0 "In order to organize some solid direction for our messy coalition, the topic of Trade Unions has been brought up within our chambers. The two main faces of our coalition, Bukharin and Spiridonova, each have their own views on how unions should be operated, organized, and what their purpose should be, but only one camp can come out on top. Bukharin firmly believes that all trade unions should be nationalized - that is, become state-owned and their activities should be subordinate to the state. Spiridonova, on the other hand, maintains the position that trade unions should be entirely free and autonomous, liberated from government restrictions or unnecessary oversight - claiming that only then will our workers truly be free. With both titans of the Russian Left making their cases well-known, it is now up to our congress to decide."

RUS_PLSR_Majority:0 "PLSR Majority"
RUS_PLSR_Majority_desc:0 "With the bulk of the coalition backing her calls for free trade unionism, the Left SRs of the PLSR under Spiridonova have risen to dominate the coalition, Now, as the majority-holding party in the state, there is little in the way that can stop President Spiridonova from achieving her liberty-infused Red dream for Russia."

These bloody days were the first major spontaneous eruption of the people’s desire for a better system - a Socialist system, and led to the first major crackdowns on our Soviets, with heroes such as Lenin being forced to flee and with fools like Trotsky being arrested. We shall not tolerate any fool who dares spit on this legacy, and on our noble pursuit of Soviet Democracy.
