BAN_OTTO_ROTH_DESC: "Otto Roth, Protector of Banat, Unifier of Banat, call him what you will, but Otto Roth is nothing short of a Banatian hero. Now that Banat is an independent nation, Otto Roth was easily able to rally the Banatians under one banner.\nBorn December 6, 1884 in Nagy-Mutnik, Otto Roth was born a Jew. There he met Petru Groza. Roth went on to renounce the Jewish faith, attend Budapest University and furthermore Leipzig University. He eventually joined the Hungarian Social Democratic Party (MSZDP). There Roth ascended the ranks of the party, eventually moving into the Banat. Now, Roth stands as one of the most benevolent leaders of his time - remarkable. Petru Groza continues to aid him, and his minister of defence Albert Bartha plan Banat's survival accordingly.\nHis threats are many, though - but with the right moves, Otto Roth can make the Banat Republic a prosperous land."
BAN_CAROL_EXILE_DESC: "Carol II, former heir to the throne of Romania, has regained his rightful throne. As King of Romania, Carol seeks to stamp out all traces of the Iron Guard that bled his country dry. In this anger comes an intense desire to restore the glory Romania once had and further that - a dream that he believes will come soon with the help of the many loyal Monarchists assisting his new Romania. Having also retaken his heartland, Carol's ambitions are only furthered - he only wants to see Romania prosper, as a shining example of what to do in the Balkan Peninsula - a place notorious for its instability. Like the previous ruler, Otto Roth, Carol II loves his people dearly, and would do most near anything to save Romania. Carol's affirmed "Greater Romania" will put his soul to rest, and fulfill his dreams. It is only then that Romania will gain its destined place among the great nations, a ferocious country with a resolve unbreakable."
BAN_ALBERT_BARTHA_DESC: "Albert Bartha, the Second Protector of the Banat. A leader with unwavering loyalty to the nation, Albert Bartha will stop at nothing to ensure the stability of Banat. Originally under Otto Roth, Albert Bartha ascended to the leadership after Roth's untimely end at the hands of an assassin. He poses as a Social Democrat, but is more authoritarian in style. He believes that the only way to keep a country stable is a strong, competent leader appointed heir by the leader themself.\nBeing a personal friend of Otto Roth meant that Bartha had unquestioned loyalty to the President of the Republic, up until the very end when Roth was failing to keep his country together. Bartha kicked the cold, dead hands of Roth off the wheel of Banat and steered the sinking ship to land, and began to lay the foundation for a strong Banatian state. In Bartha's words, "Banat will surely survive under my leadership. It might after me, but for how long I know not.""
BAN_MATYAS_RAKOSI_DESC: "Born 9th March 1892, Ada, Hungary\n\nBorn to Jewish parents in a small Hungarian village, with the birth name of Mátyás Rosenfeld, Mátyás' grandparent participated in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and subsequently his family was shunned and repressed for decades after. During his childhood, Mátyás studied extensively and finished his studies in Sopron. After finishing his studies, Mátyás joined an anarcho-syndicalist student movement in Hungary in 1910, the Gallilei Circle, and with the outbreak of war, he served in the Austro-Hungarian Army and became a prisoner of War for Russia after the Brusilov Offensive. Being exposed to Bolshevik elements after escaping from his prison camp, he slowly turned more and more authoritarian and helped the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia until it was far too late, fleeing back to his homeland, living in Budapest as a Leninist organizer until the eventual collapse of Hungary, resulting in the creation of an independent Banat Republic, becoming ever more popular and influential. Eventually, he managed to seize power through a coup and is now the single most powerful person in Banat. His ambitions lie beyond the Banatian mountains however, and it seems he will try his hardest to ensure the future of Socialism in the Balkans..."

BAN_defeat_chaos: "Overthrow Chaos"
BAN_defeat_chaos_desc: "The lands of Banat, free albeit anarchic, have to be brought together by Otto Roth in order to turn the Banat into a real nation instead of a rebellious group. Timisoara is under siege by banditry and crime, as are the other cities of our Republic. Once Banat is brought together, real progress can begin being made towards a prosperous nation."
BAN_state_of_peace: "The Nation of Peace"
BAN_state_of_peace_desc: "Now that Banat's landscapes have been pacified, it's time to put our nation in a time of healing, peace, and growth. Banat shall be, at least for now, the Nation of Peace. Otto Roth must ensure the continued absence of all violent actions, as our army hasn't yet been built, which could mean disaster."
BAN_militarized_peace: "Peace With a Military"
BAN_militarized_peace_desc: "The need for a military is extreme. Lawlessness rules much of the land outside Timisoara, which means that we cannot gain the full benefits of our territory. Once we build a sizeable military, we can begin to see the fruits of our country."
BAN_small_and_professional: "Professional Peacekeepers"
BAN_small_and_professional_desc: "Banat does not have the largest population. It, in fact, has a very small army - so we must make the most of it. Every generation of Banatian armies must know that size must be appropriate, not drastically oversized. The focal point of our armies will be the quality - Banat's armies will be some of the highest-trained men on Earth."
BAN_protect_peace: "The Vanguard of Peace"
BAN_protect_peace_desc: "In the lands that we do control, it is important that we minimize crime and all violent acts. Protecting peace is the same thing as protecting Banat. Roth must ensure that he satisfies all of the population with his current policies, as any widespread violence will surely topple Banat."
BAN_protection_with_fairness: "Fair and Just Protection"
BAN_protection_with_fairness_desc: "We have established already that peace must be protected for the moment. Criminals on trial must be treated fairly, as who knows what trials could reach the public and cause outrage. We are, for now, the will of the population, which has to stop as soon as possible."
BAN_peace_is_but_an_option: "But Peace is Just One Option"
BAN_peace_is_but_an_option_desc: "The army has been formed and we are claiming to attempt to protect the peace, but there's an undeniable fact. That fact is that peace is simply an option. Now that Banat can field an army, if violence were to break out, we now have the ability to curb it."
BAN_royalists: "Questioning the Royalist Influx"
BAN_royalists_desc: "There has recently been an influx of Romanian monarchists into the country, perhaps seeking to take over and establish a government-in-exile. The goals of these monarchists are unknown, but those are the likely answers. They may also be seeking to escape the Iron Guard."
BAN_iron_guard: "Questioning the Romanian Regime"
BAN_iron_guard_desc: "The Monarchists have forced us to take up a position against our neighbor and influencer, the Iron Guard in Romania. Our choice here may decide the fate of Banat's government."

#### Exiled Kingdom ####

BAN_exiled_kingdom: "The Kingdom in Exile"
BAN_exiled_kingdom_desc: "The Republic has been toppled, now under the command of the rightful King of Romania, Carol II. Banat will serve as our base of operations until it is time to retake our birthright. For now, however, the Kingdom of Romania in Exile must be sure to lay low, to avoid the death stare of the Iron Guard. There is no doubt that they will be hasty to declare war on us..."
BAN_romania_first: "Priority Number One"
BAN_romania_first_desc: "There is no time to wait. Romania is preparing to take back Silistria and Dobrudja, which they lost in the Weltkrieg. We have to attack now, before their army gets any stronger."
BAN_heavy_preparation: "Preparations Outrank All"
BAN_heavy_preparation_desc: "Preparation is key - perhaps with the right timing, we can intervene in a war involving Romania and Bulgaria. However, by the looks of things, we may need to prepare for war with the Serbians too."
BAN_vicious_assault: "Vicious Assault Tactics"
BAN_vicious_assault_desc: "The key to this upcoming war is fear. The Romanians might be extremist right-wingers, but that means nothing when we make examples out of every last one of their soldiers in a battle. Banat will march onwards, through any means possible. Any."
BAN_they_dont_matter: "Their Assets do not Matter"
BAN_they_dont_matter_desc: "We might be trying to retake Romania, but it is necessary that we burn down what relates to the Iron Guard's war effort - factories, offices, farms. Every last sympathizer of the Iron Guard will be burned just like their property."
BAN_begin_total_war: "We Want Total War!"
BAN_begin_total_war_desc: "It's time! Rise, monarchists of Romania! Let Carol lead us true Romanians to victory, through the ashes and smoke of the Iron Guard's facilities. Rise against the Iron Guard! On to the fight!"
BAN_appeal_bulgaria: "Petition to Bulgaria"
BAN_appeal_bulgaria_desc: "It might be of interest while we are here to ask for help from the Bulgarians. We know that they know that the Iron Guard wants their territory, so perhaps by our status as government-in-exile we will be able to consensually siphon some of their resources from them in order to further our own war effort."
BAN_appeal_hungary: "Plea to Hungary"
BAN_appeal_hungary_desc: "While the original Banat may have seceded from Hungary, we are most definitely much less of a danger to the Hungarians than the Iron Guard. We could convince the Hungarians to send us aid in the event of a war. If we do manage to secure a shipment of equipment, it will likely be large in quantity."

BAN_operations_in_homeland: "Operate in the Homeland"
BAN_operations_in_homeland_desc: "Undercover Monarchists in the original Romania have been prowling the streets of Legionary Romania for years, albeit aimlessly. Now, as we have legitimate power, we can give these agents an aim and task, to put their skills to good use, while sending our own agents."
BAN_joint_training_exercise: "Participate in a Joint Training Exercise"
BAN_joint_training_exercise_desc: "Now that we have gained ourselves an ally, we should conduct training exercises with them to prepare our armies for the struggle against the Iron Guard. It would benefit both of us, especially us - due to our inferior size and population against the large Iron Guard."
BAN_maneuvers_banatian_carpathians: "Maneuvers in the Carpathians"
BAN_maneuvers_banatian_carpathians_desc: "We must show Romania our true intentions soon. We shall let that be a show of power by a military march through the Carpathian Mountains that separate Banat and Romania from each other. Once they see our boots marching through the mountains, they will be worried."
BAN_work_on_decryption: "The Art of Decryption"
BAN_work_on_decryption_desc: "Decrypting the transmissions of the Romanian government will allow us to gain insight on their operations and inside dealings, therefore giving us a large advantage on the battlefield as we perfectly predict their location on that battlefield each and every time completely flawlessly."
BAN_great_patriotic_war: "Begin the Great Patriotic War"
BAN_great_patriotic_war_desc: "Wake up from the deep sleep, Romanian fighter, against the Legionary tyrant! Germans, Serbs, and Bulgarians will happily go to help us, and brave Monarchists from the home will be here every minute. When our lion wakes up, and then the wind starts blowing, the black gate will rust and wither. Let's wave our flags, so that our land will shine, to remind them of who we are, to crush the Iron Guard!"
BAN_foreign_army_help: "Assistance from Foreigners"
BAN_foreign_army_help_desc: "There are foreigners abroad more experienced than us, so let us use our resources to invite them to train the exiled armies so that they can be prepared for the eventual retaking of their birthright!"

#### The Unexiled Kingdom ####

BAN_exiles_no_more: "Exiles No More"
BAN_exiles_no_more_desc: "At last! The Iron Guard has been driven out from their roots in Bucharest, letting us retake the wheel from their grip. The Kingdom of Romania has been proclaimed, and celebration rules much of Banat and furthermore Monarchist-led holdouts. It will be difficult to de-radicalize the population, but it will be entirely worth it."
BAN_international_recognition: "Garner International Recognition"
BAN_international_recognition_desc: "Now that we have rebranded as the Kingdom of Romania, it is time to make ourselves more official as the legitimate government of Romania. None shall recognize Otto Roth's dead government, and furthermore none shall recognize the Iron Guard as the rightful government of Romania."
BAN_arrest_former_guard_members: "Arrest Iron Guard Activists"
BAN_arrest_former_guard_members_desc: "The Iron Guard, despite being effectively wiped out of government seats, still holds a large portion of our citizens captive. Arresting these activists for generating unrest will deal a quick end to them, but who knows what the general public will think of this move. Either way, it is for the better."
BAN_consitutional_monarchy: "Author the Constitution"
BAN_consitutional_monarchy_desc: "Now that most essentials are done, it is time to reform our government. Now that our duty has been completed, and the Iron Guard ousted, we can transform into a constitutional monarchy led by Carol. This constitution ensures fair judgement, equality, and stability."
BAN_express_wishes: "Express Our Ambitions"
BAN_express_wishes_desc: "Yet more is desired by His Majesty. His Majesty King Carol II demands the return of Transylvania to the Romanians, and word spreads that he desires the Hungarian region of Alfold as well. The Hungarians will be furious after this announcement..."
BAN_win_back_hearts: "Regain the Hearts of the People"
BAN_win_back_hearts_desc: "The people have been corrupted and tainted by the prying tendrils of the Iron Guard. A campaign against their platform will open their minds to further a re-education process."
BAN_repeat_last: "The Same Strategy"
BAN_repeat_last_desc: "The strategy used on the Iron Guard was well worth it. We can pull the same thing on the Hungarians - generate unrest in the region we want and trigger an uprising at an opportune time that is perfectly in line with our invasion."
BAN_reeducate_mistaken: "Re-educate the Mistaken"
BAN_reeducate_mistaken_desc: "While we have indeed banned and arrested members and sympathizers of the Iron Guard, this does not mean that their influence has been cleaned off from our people. It does not do much, in fact. The real way to rid the influence of the Iron Guard is by re-educating the people."
BAN_begin_taking_transylvania: "Execute Operation Decapitation"
BAN_begin_taking_transylvania_desc: "Now is the time to slice the head off of Hungary and roll it back to Austria. Transylvania will return to where it belongs as a part of Romania."
BAN_romania_improvement: "Quality is for a Romanian"
BAN_romania_improvement_desc: "The Balkans have a notorious record of bad things. Our Romania shall be the outlier, a country of high standards and high quality. The improvement of the Romanian society will bring improvement to the people living in a Romanian society."
BAN_reestablish_free_elections: "Re-establish Elections"
BAN_reestablish_free_elections_desc: "The need for total control over the government is gone. Now we can establish free elections in the Kingdom of Romania to further the freedom of the country. An amendment will be made to the Constitution to allow for elections."
BAN_bucharest_industry: "Open Wallachian Factories"
BAN_bucharest_industry_desc: "Wallachia, region of the capital of our Kingdom, could always use a little help. Projects have been going on, but nothing has really gotten anywhere. By funding some of these, we can bolster our industry."
BAN_moldavia_industry: "The Moldavia Urbanization Plan"
BAN_moldavia_industry_desc: "Moldavia is less industrialized than its neighboring Wallachia, but that does not make it any less important. In fact, it means that Moldavia has more space for factories. The land will allow for a plentiful number of factories."
BAN_improve_exile_land: "Credit the Exiled Land"
BAN_improve_exile_land_desc: "Banat was the land of the Exiled Kingdom, but now that we have returned to the homeland, we shall pay our due respects to the area by gifting it a plentiful number of industrial resources. Banat has done all it can for us, and we must show our respect back."
BAN_make_the_move: "Move Down South"
BAN_make_the_move_desc: "Bulgaria may be friendly to us and us to them, but that does not change the fact that they hold vital Romanian territory. We have to retake this land, even if it means forsaking relationships with our neighbors. Romania above all."
BAN_expanded_liberties: "Liberty is for Romanians Too"
BAN_expanded_liberties_desc: "At this point, we have made many reforms to the government. Romania is pushing out the stereotype of the Balkans with its liberty and justice. Our influence will hopefully make a lasting influence on the Balkans, allowing it to prosper in the future."
BAN_ethnic_equality: "No Inhabitant Left Behind"
BAN_ethnic_equality_desc: "Part of freedom is equality. Without equality there is no freedom. Freedom to go where you want. Freedom of speech. Freedom of the press. Segregation of all types shall be outlawed from Romania, and ethnic groups shall be promoted in order to satisfy dissidents in the cultures making up Romania."
BAN_exemplary_nation: "A Standing Example"
BAN_exemplary_nation_desc: "At last, reforms are complete! Romania stands tall above other Balkan nations as a symbol of power, unification, and democracy. The example provided by us should be a guideline to all nations of the Balkans and furthermore of what to do."

BAN_foreign_policy: "Foreign Policy of the Kingdom"
BAN_foreign_policy_desc: "There is no character of a nation without a foreign policy. Our foreign policy shall be decided soon, but it is likely that it will turn to anti-Austrian sentiment soon, along with anti-Bulgarian sentiment, despite them being our primary choices for alliance back in exile times."
BAN_join_reichspakt: "Protection under the Superpower"
BAN_join_reichspakt_desc: "Germany has reigned over Europe for years, so it is only natural that we should seek protection under them and join the Mitteleuropa."
BAN_take_bukovina: "Nab the Bukovina"
BAN_take_bukovina_desc: "The Bukovina has a large Romanian population under Austrian control. It should be of interest to take it over, as was the goal back in the Weltkrieg."
BAN_join_entente: "Our Abandoned Friends"
BAN_join_entente_desc: "A long time ago, back when the Weltkrieg raged and the massive Russian Empire existed, we attempted to fight on the side of the Triple Entente. We failed. However, we have experienced exile and returned from it, so let us encourage the Entente to return themselves home, and bring success to the world."
BAN_finish_hungary: "Put Hungary out of its Misery"
BAN_finish_hungary_desc: "Otto Roth's Banat already seceded from Hungary, and we took it over. Hungary, having fought a war with Romania, is exhausted, so it is only necessary that we finish them off and pick the meat off its corpse, as long as Austria does not intervene."
BAN_gut_ukraine: "Gut the Ukraine"
BAN_gut_ukraine_desc: "Ukraine holds some provinces of interest for the dream of Greater Romania. The biggest risk to this plan would be German intervention, so we must tread carefully."
BAN_belgrade_pact: "In Balkan Interests"
BAN_belgrade_pact_desc: "Being in the treacherous Balkans demands protection, and that can be found in like-minded nations of the Balkans, the Serbs in particular. An alliance would be beneficial to both of us."
BAN_ally_poland: "Cooperate with the Poles"
BAN_ally_poland_desc: "Poland has had a similarly bad past like us, so perhaps a mutual agreement of alliance and assistance would benefit us both in many ways. We should invite them to our alliance."
BAN_attack_syndicalism: "Curb the Revolution"

BAN_declare_greater_romania_desc: "At last. It is done. All of the lands described in the dreams of a Greater Romania are under our control. There is a little more we can do, but for now, we have done enough. Romania has earned her place among the nations of the world as a fiercer fighter than anyone ever would have thought."
BAN_romanian_sphere: "One Harmonious Alliance"
BAN_romanian_sphere_desc: "An even better choice would be our own sphere of influence with nearby Balkan and near-Balkan nations. Only a few nations will get the special privilege of being in our alliance, which will ensure it is a quality organization with heartfelt help that is meant."

#### Iron Guard Banat ####
BAN_iron_guard_banat: "The Iron Guard in Banat"
BAN_iron_guard_banat_desc: "The Iron Guard has spread its influence over to another - the socialist nation in the Balkans, Banat. The Iron Guard controls Banat now, and its future is up to the new Iron Guard in Banat."
BAN_only_one_path: "The Only Path"
BAN_only_one_path_desc: "The only viable path in a situation like ours is to go out alone into this world. Without the Iron Guard in Romania, and without Romania in general, Banat strikes on its own towards glory."
BAN_populist_rhetoric: "Populist Rhetoric"
BAN_populist_rhetoric_desc: "The nation that resided under Otto Roth's socialist rule will need some convincing to be for our cause. Sima can take care of that through constant speeches that are broadcasted by radio frequently."
BAN_turn_southwards: "Eye on the Southern Front"
BAN_turn_southwards_desc: "Illyria has long been plagued by warring ethnicities. We can invade under the pretext of stabilization, only to annex them and bring the Iron Guard to yet another nation. But for now, we must watch the situation carefully to determine an opportune time."
BAN_cauterize_illyria: "Cauterize Illyria"
BAN_cauterize_illyria_desc: "A time and date has been selected - now is our time! Illyria will surely be unable to resist our push. Soon Banatian boots will march through the smoldering streets of Zagreb. Glory to the Eternal Nation!"
BAN_army_for_strong: "The Army is for the Strong"
BAN_army_for_strong_desc: "The Army's standards must be heightened in order to give it a fighting advantage. Able men must be conscripted and turned into the strongest, fiercest fighting machines that the world has ever seen. Only the strong shall be a part of the army. The weak can be let in, but they will not go into battle weak."
BAN_turn_northwards: "Sights Northward"
BAN_turn_northwards_desc: "Transylvania has long housed a Romanian minority. Coordination with Romania on an invasion of Transylvania would be necessary to pull this sort of feat off, though. There is no way we can solo the Hungarians alone, so it is necessary that Romania come to our aid."
BAN_co_invasion_transylvania: "Joint Invasion of Transylvania"
BAN_co_invasion_transylvania_desc: "Plans have been drafted and armies readied. The time to strike is now, the time to reclaim is now, and the time to show the world the power of the Iron Guard is now. Transylvania, here we come! Your liberators are coming!"
BAN_romanian_military_mission: "Military Envoy to Romania"
BAN_romanian_military_mission_desc: "Having a friend is neat and all, but we have not cooperated militarily yet. The next step in the friendship between us is military cooperation, which will bring strength to the unified armies of the Iron Guard, and will prepare the soldiers for a full invasion, whether it be offensive or defensive in nature."
BAN_mutual_research_pact: "Mutual Research Agreement"
BAN_mutual_research_pact_desc: "Banat's small population and limited resources makes it difficult to discover new things, so it would be very beneficial to have another party helping us. That party is obviously our neighboring Romanians, who have a larger population and pool of resources. A request for research cooperation is also a further step in friendship."
BAN_join_entente_natpop: "Off With the King"
BAN_join_entente_natpop_desc: "The Banat is a small nation, and there are few allies around, so it would be in our interest to gain the favor of the Entente. Although they cannot reach us, the air power of the Entente would be of help, as Banat's industry is far too small to support a real aircraft industry."
BAN_belgrade_pact_natpop: "In Romania's Interests"
BAN_belgrade_pact_natpop_desc: "How the Romanians thought then are how we think now - should we join up with Serbia? Our answer is yes. The Serbs can help us militarily by land, and should be more than willing to gain another ally against the Austrians. Together we stand, we hope."
BAN_return_confidence: "Return Confidence in the Government"
BAN_return_confidence_desc: "The people have lost a lot of confidence with the Four Squares Protest and the larger scene around it, and now that these protests are over, it is time to heal. Heal our nation's wounds and internal issues, whether it be peacefully with speeches and laws or by forced cooperation."
BAN_autarky_necessary: "Autarky is Necessary"
BAN_autarky_necessary_desc: "Autarky. Autarky is self-sufficiency of an economy. Our economy, when self-sufficient, will be able to withstand nearly any economic crisis. This is why autarky is a necessity, to power the country through the future ahead."
BAN_popular_dictatorship: "A Popular Dictatorship..."
BAN_popular_dictatorship_desc: "We have healed the nation, we have spoiled the nation, we have helped the nation. Iron Guard Banat stands strong. The dictatorship is popular in both Banat and in the watchers abroad. Banat has seen the glory, and still does see that glory. Hail!"
BAN_dictatorship_of_progress: "...is also a Dictatorship of Progress"
BAN_dictatorship_of_progress_desc: "The future comes every day, and every day prosperity sends another courier to Banat. Sima keeps these couriers coming, and they must continue to visit Banat for it to stay afloat as a sovereign nation. But, as for now, our business is booming - there has been no better time to be a Banatian."
BAN_factory_labor: "Labor for the Factories"
BAN_factory_labor_desc: "A strong nation requires a strong workforce, the labourers of Banat are the backbone of this nation and only through their hard work can we succeed. We will focus on securing every man in Banat a job, the majority of these will be toiling in the factories."
BAN_citizen_satisfaction: "Satisfaction of the Citizenry"
BAN_citizen_satisfaction_desc: "A failing nation is one that a people can not be proud of. With our greater workforce building the Bantian economy and industry we can put resources into the construction of more civilian factories. "
BAN_military_parade_sequence: "A Parade down the Streets"
BAN_military_parade_sequence_desc: "This well trained and disciplined military must be presented to the public, the citizens of our nation must be aware that they are under the benevolent protection of a strong regime. Mass parades in honour of the glorious national father, Horia Sima, will be held with lines of battle-hardened soldiers on full display. The might of Banat will be known to all! "

#### The Red Nation ####
BAN_red_and_redder: "The Red and Redder Banat"
BAN_red_and_redder_desc: "Each and every day, the Revolution grows stronger. Here in Banat is no different. To the outsider it may have seemed that Syndicalism was doomed, but now it thrives. The Revolution can be anywhere at any time, and you will never always know."
BAN_join_brethren: "Join our Brethren"
BAN_join_brethren_desc: "The Revolution has cast aside the alliances of old and created a new bloc. The Third Internationale is the primary faction of the Revolution, linking the socialists of the world together. To truly be a part of the Revolution, we should join the forces of the Internationale."
BAN_let_loose_unions: "Set the Unions Free"
BAN_let_loose_unions_desc: "While the trade unions under Roth were a compromise between capitalism and socialism, Horia Sima's regime took away all freedom that the trade unions once had. Now that freedom returns, but in greater amounts."
BAN_establish_communes: "Establish a Communal System"
BAN_establish_communes_desc: "As a socialist nation, a communal system will pave the way to the socialist economy in the future. A communal system is step one, and step one is where progress begins. With this step comes real recognition of the socialism our state provides."
BAN_healthcare_worth_act: "The Worthy Healthcare Act"
BAN_healthcare_worth_act_desc: "The Worthy Healthcare Act is an act that allows for cheap, accessible healthcare that is not exploited by the state. This Act will ensure happiness for our people, for under fascist and capitalist systems healthcare is far too expensive for the average man."
BAN_the_transition: "Complete Banat's Transition"
BAN_the_transition_desc: "A communal system, healthcare reform, and further behind-the-scenes reforms has sufficiently paved the Banatian way to socialism. In a few days the last of the major reforms will be enacted, fully bringing Banat over into socialism."
BAN_only_good_syndicalist: "The Only Good Syndicalist"
BAN_only_good_syndicalist_desc: "Most nations hate syndicalists and socialists. Canadians, Germans, Russians, and the Japanese. All reactionary nations. But there is one outlier to the hated syndicalist nations, and that belongs to the Banat Syndicate. Proud, the Syndicate preaches unity among its people and keeps its people satisfied. Its kind policies and progressive system has given it the nickname "The Only Good Syndicalist.""
BAN_give_them_what_they_deserve: "Give Them What They Deserve"
BAN_give_them_what_they_deserve_desc: "Otto Roth was unjustly executed by the evil Horia Sima. Now much revenge has been enacted upon Sima, but it is not enough. Roth lies in his grave unhonored. It is time to construct the mausoleum of Otto Roth, and give him his proper honors as a hero and unifier. As for Totalist Matyas Rakosi, he will be found and executed immediately for treason against the state."
BAN_satellite_serbia: "Satellite Serbia"
BAN_satellite_serbia_desc: "Now that our country is under control, stabilized, and ready, we can export the Revolution. Our immediate neighbors, Serbia and Romania, will be the first to fall to the exportation of the Banatian Revolution. We may only now be called a good syndicalist in internal policies."
BAN_paint_romania_red: "Paint the Romanians Red"
BAN_paint_romania_red_desc: "Now that our country is under control, stabilized, and ready, we can export the Revolution. Our immediate neighbors, Serbia and Romania, will be the first to fall to the exportation of the Banatian Revolution. We may only now be called a good syndicalist in internal policies."
BAN_red_balkan_prussia: "Turn the Balkan Prussia Sympathetic"
BAN_red_balkan_prussia_desc: "Bulgaria, the Prussia of the Balkans, reigned over the Balkans for about a decade, but now the Revolution will take down any power it has left. The armies of the Revolutionaries in Serbia, the Banat, and Romania will bring cheers to the streets of Sofia whether their government likes it or not."
BAN_the_rest_of_them: "The Rest of Them"
BAN_the_rest_of_them_desc: "The first three specific goals have been completed. The rest of the Balkans and territory around the Balkans must be conquered in the name of the Revolution, and through any means possible. An Eastern side to the Internationale has already worried many of the reactionaries, but a continued revolution may bring much opposition."
BAN_illyrian_protector: ""Protect" Illyria"
BAN_illyrian_protector_desc: "Illyria suffers under their capitalists. Only under our benevolent rule can the roving ethnicities of Illyria be pacified. A union may need to be proclaimed between our two nations, and bring Petru Groza and the [BAN.GetAdjective] government together. This union will work just because our administration promotes unity among the population..."
BAN_our_own_place: "Our Own Internationale"
BAN_our_own_place_desc: "The Internationale is for the west. Our Internationale is for the East. Thus the Fourth Internationale shall be created, and all socialists of the East are invited to take part. Socialism makes victories every day."

BAN_balkan_federation_desc: "At last, the Revolution has reached its height and the peoples of the Balkans have been conquered. Now at last we can rest."

#### The Dark Red Nation ####
BAN_red_and_darker: "The Darker Red Banat"
BAN_red_and_darker_desc: "Each and every day, the Revolution grows stronger. Here in Banat is no different. To the outsider it may have seemed that Totalism was doomed, but now it thrives. The Revolution can be anywhere at any time, and you will never always know."
BAN_eliminate_nationalism: "Eliminate Nationalism"
BAN_eliminate_nationalism_desc: "Nationalism in the Banat causes many problems for it. An official crackdown on all nationalism and nationalistic behaviour will cull the desire to return to their mother country. A Banatian is a Banatian, and not a Serb, Romanian, Hungarian, or Swabian."
BAN_radicalize_grozas_followers: "Radicalize Groza's Followers"
BAN_radicalize_grozas_followers_desc: "Groza still prowls our streets, speaking out against our "radical and tyrannical" government. However, we can sway his followers and confuse them with our own advertisements and propaganda, while also discrediting Groza and preparing him to meet his maker."
BAN_groza_the_traitor: "Execute Traitor Groza"
BAN_groza_the_traitor_desc: "Groza has done it now. He is running out of time here and continues living on. We will make sure that this happens no longer, and that an end is put to him swiftly and mercilessly. There won't be any dissidents in our Banat."
BAN_go_dark: "Let There Be Darkness"
BAN_go_dark_desc: "To keep our plans hidden from everyone, the communication cables connecting Banat to everyone else will be severed. Radio will be blocked. A border wall will be set up, with armed guards at all times. Banat will essentially go dark, with no information on what is happening."
BAN_release_darkness: "Let the Darkness Flow"
BAN_release_darkness_desc: "Our plan regarding Hungary has finished development. The training for the soldiers is done. Now all that is left to do is take on the Hungarians ourselves, and with that a massive draft at a scale never seen before."
BAN_peoples_hungary: "A Hungary for the People"
BAN_peoples_hungary_desc: "Hungary is ours! The red banner of Banat hangs over the Hungarian Parliament Building and down the avenues of Budapest as the conscripted armies of the Banat dissolve to return to civilian life. The government is moving to Budapest to set up a new capital, and resistance movements are cropping up all over Hungary."
BAN_force_stabilize_hungary: "Forcefully Stabilize Hungary"
BAN_force_stabilize_hungary_desc: "The resistance is troublesome. Therefore, we must deal with them. In any way or means possible. We will use whatever resources are needed in order to quell the resistance and stabilize Hungary. Fear is an instrumental tool in the culling of dissent..."
BAN_free_workers: "Free the Worker"
BAN_free_workers_desc: "While the workers before Roth were a compromise between capitalism and socialism, The Weltkrieg took away all freedom that the workers once had. Now that freedom returns, but in greater amounts."
BAN_hungarys_horizons: "Hungary on the Horizon"
BAN_hungarys_horizons_desc: "Hungary has entered a new age. A prosperous age. Hungary is ready to show itself to the world as a new, reborn, rebranded nation. Over the horizon the red banners of [BAN.GetNameDef] flutter in the wind as new Hungarian armies are raised and the crimson lights get stronger."
BAN_red_danube: "The Danube, Red as a Syndicalist"
BAN_red_danube_desc: "While we may have taken Hungary, we must take on their former overlord - Austria. Austria stands as a threat to the new Hungary, and is likely building up for an eventual war. Thus we must strike preemptively, and finish off the dying Habsburg Monarchy."
BAN_keep_them_in: "Erect the Great Barrier"
BAN_keep_them_in_desc: "The wall rises high above the borders of Banat. Towering, it says to everybody that you will not be entering here. Occasionally, you'll hear a crack in the air from the direction of the wall. What goes on in Banat, stays in Banat. No matter what."


#### Otto Roth's Government ####
BAN_roth_unbroken: "Otto Roth Unbroken"
BAN_roth_unbroken_desc: "The Peacemaker of the Balkans and his government has narrowly survived a period of unrest and instability over the issue of the Iron Guard. Although initially fearful, Roth has been able to keep the government together long enough to bring it through the problems."
BAN_harshness_is_necessary: "Harshness is a Necessity"
BAN_harshness_is_necessary_desc: "Otto Roth is not one to kill and hurt - but at times that must be done. The troublemakers Horia Sima and Avram Imbroane both need to be arrested as soon as possible, so that instability does not further gash the seams of Banatian unity."
BAN_preach_ethnic_unity: "Preach Ethnic Unity"
BAN_preach_ethnic_unity_desc: "One of the founding points of the Banat Republic was that of unity. We may have had a rocky beginning, but we have passed the bumps in the road. The pillar of equality may have never been built, but now we can at last erect the final pillar of Banatian society: equality."
BAN_work_of_will: "Work from the Will"
BAN_work_of_will_desc: "A worker will forever hate his job in the factory if he is exploited and meaningless. They are unencouraged and tired of their labor. A reason is what they need. A reason on why they should work, and not just "because it makes everyone else happy.""
BAN_it_was_one_option: "Peace Really Was an Option"
BAN_it_was_one_option_desc: "When the government had an army for the times that there was no peace, they said that peace was always the first option of the government. Not anymore. The Army shall receive extra supplies and funding that will propel it to at least be able to defend Banat from a one-sided invasion."
BAN_demand_hungarian_referendum: "Referendum For the People"
BAN_demand_hungarian_referendum_desc: "There are lands outside our current holdings that we desire. These lands are currently under Hungarian administration. They may be willing to hold a referendum for ownership of these territories if we pledge friendly relations and aid to their nation."
BAN_protect_our_independence: "Protect the Pride of Independence"
BAN_protect_our_independence_desc: "Banat has not been a nation in being for long. Being so small, one would not think that our resources are plentiful. This may bring unwanted attention, either from the Hungarians, Serbians, or Romanians. Obviously, there is a need for Banat to constantly and consistently display military power to other nations in order to ward off invasion."
BAN_adjust_rothian_thought: "Adjust the Rothian School of Thought"
BAN_adjust_rothian_thought_desc: "The unrest that happened a while ago took a toll on Otto Roth, causing a rethink of his ideology. He has decided to adjust his thought, and instead of seeing Banat away from other nations, he decided it would be a better play to draw Banat closer to other nations and define a more strict foreign policy."
BAN_peaceful_rhetoric: "Peaceful Rhetoric"
BAN_peaceful_rhetoric_desc: "While peace may be but one option, it is the better option. Keeping the peace in Banat is vital to survival, as a popular uprising would easily unseat the government. Otto Roth will be performing speeches and other broadcasts on why exactly peace is the way of progress."
BAN_ready_banat_for_the_world: "Banat on the World Stage"
BAN_ready_banat_for_the_world_desc: "Banat has mostly kept to itself in its short existence, but it is time to stop that isolationist policy, and come out onto the world stage with everyone else. With this step comes opportunities of international trade and alliances, things we desperately need for survival."
BAN_expanded_welfare: "Expand Healthcare Options"
BAN_expanded_welfare_desc: "As with any good socialist or social-democrat nation, we must implement cheaper healthcare with what we have available to us. It is vital that the nation's people are always in tip-top shape, in order to make sure they are ready for a draft."
BAN_vanguard_of_rational_thought: "The Vanguard of Rational Thought"
BAN_vanguard_of_rational_thought_desc: "The world is full of radical thought. New and untested schools of thought worm their way into the heads of people. Rational thought is in low supply these days. With Otto Roth's compromising power he and his government may be able to keep the mind working rationally and not drifting astray."
BAN_new_identity: "The Banatian Identity"
BAN_new_identity_desc: "Hungarians. Jews. Swabians. Bulgarians. Serbs. Romanians. These are the peoples of the Banat. But no longer. Under Otto Roth they have been united. United as one people, as a culture. The Banatians. Cultural unity has made leaps here in short amounts of time, and it is all thanks to Otto Roth."
BAN_right_to_light: "Bring the Far-Right Far into the Light"
BAN_right_to_light_desc: "Banat may be unified, but it is quite alone in terms of like-minded neighbors. The Romanians in the east constantly push for attacks to reclaim their "rightful territory" from anyone who dares house Romanians. Our country may be small, but it is strong. Now it is time. Rise up and strike at the heart of this evil ideology!"
BAN_join_reichspakt_roth: "Banat with the Empire"
BAN_join_reichspakt_roth_desc: "The German Empire, while more right-wing than us, is a fine protector. Otto Roth could easily sway a negotiation in order to sign an alliance between our countries, and join both the Reichspakt and the Mitteleuropa."
BAN_join_austria: "Reconciliation with the Austrians"
BAN_join_austria_desc: "Our country was birthed from the flames of a pointless war between the Hungarians and the Romanians. The Hungarians have been somewhat bitter about the loss of the Banat ever since, but perhaps we can manipulate Austria into a mutual protection alliance."
BAN_join_serbia_roth: "With our Neighbors"
BAN_join_serbia_roth_desc: "Our neighbors like Serbia hold the greatest potential of protecting us in the case of invasion. Although right wing, it is easy to enter into these kinds of alliances, maybe with the slightest hint of gifts to come if they accept. However, we will be expected to be drawn into wars..."
BAN_align_internationale: "Closer Ties with the Western Leftists"
BAN_align_internationale_desc: "Ah! Our fellow leftists. Although authoritarian, they would make for a great ally, especially if we modify our appearance to appear more syndicalist than it really is. They can promote their ideology all they want, but we are independent from that, and simply an "ally of the Revolution.""
BAN_join_canada: "Ally with Canada"
BAN_join_canada_desc: "The exiles in Canada see any European allies as very valuable allies - closer to their homeland. We are a direct link on land - all they need is a port for them to land on. An alliance would be very easy to obtain with them, likely due to Canada's desperation to retake the Home Islands, which we may appear to be able to help in, but we really aren't."
BAN_align_russia: "Align with the East"
BAN_align_russia_desc: "We are in Eastern Europe, but the Russians are farther East than us. Nevertheless, we still are fairly close to each other. They may want more countries in their alliance to further the dream of retaking the lands of the old Russia, and achieve Pan-Slavism. While we are not Slavs, we could be a valuable asset in achieving this goal."

#### Albert Bartha's Military Government ####
BAN_barthas_banat: "Albert Bartha's Banat"
BAN_barthas_banat_desc: "Otto Roth is dead. His successor, Albert Bartha, has taken up the mantle of the leader of Banat, and must quickly find a way to deal with the situation at hand. Should he be unable, Banat will cease to exist. Thus it is of major importance that Bartha swiftly strikes down the instability before it roots deeper into Banat."
BAN_arms_for_army: "Arms for an Army"
BAN_arms_for_army_desc: "An army that has no arms is not an army. It is a disarmy. A disarmy does not protect its nation, so we must construct the facilities to produce the arms. Banat will be unable to defend itself without these factories. Our disarmy must be armed and transformed into an army."
BAN_wash_away_instability: "Wash Away the Instability"
BAN_wash_away_instability_desc: "The fault with Roth's government was the leniency. We shall not tolerate any sort of misdemeanor any longer. They must be charged and treated as heinous criminals.

BAN_join_entente_bartha_desc: "The exiles in Canada see any European allies as very valuable allies - closer to their homeland. We are a direct link on land - all they need is a port for them to land on. An alliance would be very easy to obtain with them, likely due to Canada's desperation to retake the Home Islands, which we may appear to be able to help in, but we really aren't."

BAN_loyalty_to_new_conducator_desc: "Albert Bartha, the new leader of the Banat Republic, has declared martial law, suspended the Banatian Constitution, and furthermore established what is basically a military dictatorship.

BAN_join_reichspakt_bartha_desc: "The German Empire, while more right-wing than us, is a fine protector. Albert Bartha could easily sway a negotiation in order to sign an alliance between our countries, and join both the Reichspakt and the Mitteleuropa."

BAN_raise_taxes: "Add to the Tax"

#### EVENTS ####
################

ban.1.t: "Banatian Revolt!"
ban.1.d: "The hotspot of unpopularity for this war are in our regions bordering Romania, Transylvania and the Banat. Over the first few days of this war, the Banat has seen a general loss of order. The only order that remains is in Timisoara - and that order isn't even ours.\n A Swabian politician by the name of Otto Roth, with backing of Hungarian officers Romanian politicians, has dismantled Hungarian banners around the Timisoara area and raised crimson red banners under the name of an independent Banat Republic. Outside Timisoara, lawlessness still reigns over the land. However, masses of people from the chaos-stricken regions are moving towards Timisoara, and the engulfed government of the Western Banat is reportedly attempting to join the Banat.\n The Banat Republic has sued for a white peace with the Romanians, and are gathering soldiers and arms to retake their claimed land, the  counties of Krasso-Szoreny and the West Banat.\nOtto Roth is a reported social democrat and socialist. His government consists of himself, the more right-wing Hungarian officer Albert Bartha, syndicalist Petru Groza, and social democrat Ion Flueras.\nWhatever they think they're doing, they won't be doing soon after we finish this war..."
ban.1.a: "We can't do anything right now, we'll return later."
ban.1.b: "For the Republic!"

ban.2.t: "West Banat joins the Banat Republic"
ban.2.d: "As expected, the government of West Banat went rogue. They have ceded every centimeter of their land to the new Banat Republic. And yet that was a horrible idea - not just because we didn't want it, but now also because lawlessness has spread to it and embroiled West Banat in unrest. This war has to be wrapped up soon."
ban.2.a: "Troubling."

ban.3.t: "Banat seizes the Vojvodina!"
ban.3.d: "News has just reached us that the Banatian armed forces have seized the region of Vojvodina, justifying their invasion as simply securing their borders. From this aggressive expansion it is clear the Banatian Republic is not afraid to use force to occupy its surrounding areas, a surprising development considering how small the nation is..."
ban.3.a: "Greedy bastards!"

ban.4.t: "Romanian Monarchist Influx"
ban.4.d: "The establishment of our Banat Republic has brought quite a bit of unwanted attention to that of Romanian Monarchists and loyalists to Carol II. It's even rumored that the King himself is being hidden in our country along with his cabinet. The Monarchists already had a foothold, but now it is larger.\n\n Otto Roth's inspection of the streets of Timisoara found him looking at many monarchist posters and suspicious men. Their eyes looked at Roth crookedly, as if they were seeking something from him, something to rob. Their gazes haunted his cruise, whether they be from beige-coated men or black-coated men. Everywhere they spied...\nWhen Otto Roth returned to the presidential residence, shaken, he was asked the obvious: "Are you okay?"\nOf course that's a no from him, as he laid out the details of his inspection, his spinning brain, his lack of concentration on the task at hand... "Well, President," the loyal man replied, "couldn't they just be not trying to get caught staring at you, our President?"\n"No, no, sir. There was no way..." Roth replied, holding his head. He straightened, looking beyond the disconcerted man. "I must discuss this with Bartha." Roth excused, turning tail and walking away with an obvious droop in his gait."
ban.4.a: "This may not be a good thing..."

ban.5.t: "Avram Imbroane makes a speech"
ban.5.d: "Two hours ago, at Liberty Square in Timisoara, monarchist advocator Avram Imbroane established a makeshift podium with his entourage, and with a booming voice that could be heard all over the great city, proposed his idea for a constitutional monarchy in the Banat, with Otto Roth as prime minister and the King, Carol II, as head of state - and he would have a final say.\nThe hordes trickled into the square, listening to this proposal with unlocked ears and minds.\n\nAlbert Bartha, disguised as a commoner as he usually was, set foot in the range of the thunderous speech of Imbroane.\n "The Republic will not survive this century. It will never survive this century, not without a strong figurehead. Roth is too lenient, too generous. He gives you too much, so much so that you wish for more, eternally hungry for more. And that inspires the feeling that you can do whatever you want, and that is never how a country should be run. Banat is no anarchy."\n Bartha, deeply troubled, realized the points in Imbroane's speech, especially that of Roth's leniency. None of the unscrupulous outlaws prowling the country were executed, none given hefty punishment. None given what they had deserved.\nThe thundering speech of Imbroane only continued about how the government was doomed for failure as Bartha slinked back to the safety of the government complex."
ban.5.a: "We won't listen to anything that rabble rouser has to say..."

ban.6.t: "Royalist Influx into Banat"
ban.6.d: "The siren sounded again. Another one had breached the hasty barricade along the border that blocked entry into the Banat. With a crack and thump, the alarm silenced itself. The body was dragged off to the writhing flames off to the side of the guard post, and fed to it. Such was life for a few days now - after reports had claimed a massive refugee influx into the newly-founded Banat Republic. A wave of documents providing information of the exiled King of Romania, Carol II, in the Republic has caused a hasty transfer of troops westwards towards our mutual border. One warning before the first line, and then a bullet in the head as the second warning. The bodies pile so high, that the bodies had to be burned, and yet the piles dotting the wall get larger and larger. No reports of the hefty burning and deeds we commit here have come out... yet.\nEach day, the citizen woke up from his hut in the Carpathian Mountains. But he did not wake himself up, the runners did.\nKnock knock. The citizens couldn't respond any more. Knock knock. Eventually the sound of shoes crunching snow faded away, leaving only the wind as the sound for him to hear yet again. Every few days there were knocks at his door, and his brain was running out of power.\nKnock knock. The citizen scrambled to his feet, grabbing something clinky that delighted the strangers outside, but then a deafening blast and crash came from inside the house.\NThe strangers never got an answer from that citizen, but the military gave them an answer with a gunshot."
ban.6.a: "Nothing will happen."

ban.7.t: "Attempted Murder on Avram Imbroane!"
ban.7.d: "Two hours ago from[GetDateText]. Apartment 44, Piata Marasti.\nAvram Imbroane was pacing in his apartment, contemplating his thoughts and next move. Thump. Thump. His door rumbled, but he was too engrossed in his thoughts to notice. The door creaked open, and a lone man crept in. Imbroane turned around in his pacing to an armed citizen. "What do you-" Imbroane began, before three gunshots rang out from across the room and whizzed towards the perplexed and angry Imbroane. All three hit him squarely in unimportant areas, but blood as red as the flag of Banat flows out of his body. As the security guard rushed up the stairs, shot the gunman dead, and ran into Imbroane's room, Imbroane bled and bled, coughing and sputtering. He was ferried off to a hospital within minutes, and soon a crowd of Monarchists had formed around the hospital, chanting angrily against the government and waiting anxiously for the announcement. It seemed like days before they got an announcement, but it really was only one hour since the trio of gunshots. After that hour had ticked over, the administrator exited the building to the anxious masses, and to the crowd he pronounced that Avram Imbroane, loyal to King Carol II, had initially survived the three gunshots and..."
ban.7.a: "...died mere minutes afterwards."
ban.7.b: "...is in critical condition, but will recover."

ban.8.t: "Imbroane Protests against the Government"
ban.8.d: "Stumbling out of the hospital on the day he was proclaimed to be released, Imbroane was greeted by a silent crowd. No cheers, no noise. Just the noise of the wind and nature of Timisoara. It was a silent vigil.\nImbroane perched himself on the stairs to the hospital, and with vigor further emphasized the evil government and how Roth was "out to get him". "
ban.8.a: "Attempt to appease him"
ban.8.b: "He can't do anything to us"

ban.9.t: "Another attempt on Imbroane's life!"
ban.9.d: "Even though Avram Imbroane survived the first attempt on his life, there was another. As he was giving another speech today, a line of gunshots echoed throughout the open air. Of course, Imbroane ducked for cover, and as the crowd fled and the dust cleared, there were no apparent injuries. The distance had saved Imbroane, and rumor has it that he is already preparing another anti-Roth speech.\nWe have to do something sooner or later, because this government may become no more with just how slow it is responding to a crisis such as this."
ban.9.a: "Find the assassin!"

ban.10.t: "Imbroane speaks out again!"
ban.10.d: "Angry and embittered by the government's "numerous failures and misdemeanors", Imbroane has protested our government once again, with fiery speeches that echo throughout the entire Republic, lighting some of the spirits of the people. His movement is gaining support dangerously quickly, and protests are cropping up from small batches to large, sponsored riots.\n\nOtto Roth continues to denounce and verbally attack protestors and especially Imbroane, but it does not help. In fact, it just riles them up more. It seems there is no easy win for us, and the one solution is cooperation."
ban.10.a: "We have to do something."
ban.10.b: "Give him armed guards."

ban.11.t: "Royalist Unrest"
ban.11.d: "The speeches delegated out to the population by Avram Imbroane have obviously been having no good effects on the population. His attacks on the government, pointing out its flaws in his views, are riling up our population with a terrible amount of speed. These protests that have started small from the minority Monarchists who fled to Banat after its establishment have evolved into large swaths of people clamoring for the ousting of Otto Roth. It seems to be taking a toll on his mental health, although his personal doctor says that with time Otto Roth will recover, and that time being after stability is restored to the Banat Republic."
ban.11.a: "Denounce the Iron Guard for this."
ban.11.b: "Denounce the Monarchists for this."

ban.12.t: "Avram Imbroane Dies!"
ban.12.d: "The man himself, Avram Imbroane, has been killed today. His third assassination attempt in a year, he was doing his usual: giving a speech. While delivering this speech to his enthusiastic masses, a loud boom blasted over the voice of Imbroane, and then there was silence. The stunned crowd had no idea what happened, until they were ushered away by Banatian police units. Later, the presses were rolling, with the headline of the death of the monarchist Avram Imbroane. While he was a thorn in our side, the situation is nowhere near resolved."
ban.12.a: "This isn't that bad, but we have to deal with the Guard"

ban.13.t: "A Plan to Kill Otto Roth"
ban.13.d: "The Swabian Otto Roth has been siphoning our population away from us. This has been going on for far too long - it never should have happened in the first place. We have devised a plan to eliminate him, which will send their nation spiraling into chaos. The plan involves sending an elite sniper to kill Otto Roth inside the government palace, shattering the window he sits behind and shooting him in the head from afar. The plan has nearly no chance of failure, but really, what is the gain from doing such a thing? We may be able to take Banat with this."
ban.13.a: "He is no Romanian!"
ban.13.b: "No need for this."

ban.14.t: "Monarchists raise a militia!"
ban.14.d: "The dastardly monarchists under Avram Imbroane have managed to legally secure enough arms to raise a militia, under the guise of defending the country from the evil Iron Guard. However, this veil is transparent. We know for a fact that they plan on taking over our government with this militia, and the only way to avoid it is by cooperation, even if it increases the influence of the monarchists in the country. Cooperation with this radical militia could be the difference between life and death for Otto Roth's government."
ban.14.a: "That's not a bad development at all..."
ban.14.b: "They mean business - cooperation may be preferable"

ban.15.t: "Attempt on Otto Roth's Life!"
ban.15.d: "Of course our nation is under attack again! While Otto Roth was pondering his government's policies, the glass behind him gave way and a shower of glass and wood splinters impacted Roth, who was now on the ground. His aides and guards rushed to his position, only for another shot to ring out and hit his leg. Roth was quickly in safety, and tended to. A thorough police investigation has revealed that the perpetrators of the attack were the Iron Guard, and that the apprehended suspect was hired by them with the intent of destabilizing the country by killing Roth. Needless to say, we dodged a bullet."
ban.15.a: "Perhaps the Royalists were right!"
ban.15.b: "The small wound becomes infected..."

ban.16.t: "Otto Roth Assassinated!"
ban.16.d: "Father of Banat, Otto Roth, whilst in the midst of giving a speech to our young nation, was tragically struck twice in the chest and leg. While rushed to safety, the unclean state of the position of the speech resulted in the rapid infection of the wound by a ravenous bacterium, and this morning, Roth passed away in his sleep due to the rabid infection. The legionary terrorist has been apprehended, but the wrench thrown into the Banatian cogs will take years to get dislodged..."
ban.16.a: "I feel a storm brewing."

ban.17.t: "Denounced!"
ban.17.d: "The death of our leader has left the military and his cabinet furious, it is clear to all that this was a direct attack from Romania. Already there are rumours spreading that the killer is a loyal henchman of Horia Sima, Romania’s favourite legionary in Banat. These rumours alone provide the government with enough justification to declare war on Romania, however our newly founded nation is weak. How should we respond..."
ban.17.a: "They'll regret that"
ban.17.b: "Like you can do anything!"

ban.18.t: "The Situation Calms Down"
ban.18.d: "Despite tensions being at an all time high with Romania, our level headed leaders have agreed that a direct conflict with Romania would most certainly not be in the best interest of Banat. Romania’s military is far greater in size and armaments, than the Banatian military. A resulting war would destroy us... we will avenge Roth however now is not the right time."
ban.18.a: "That's relieving"

ban.19.t: "Bartha's Banat"
ban.19.d: "Following the death of Rotha, in order to prevent further chaos the military under the command of General Albert Bartha have seized control. Rapidly asserting direct control over the nation, the military junta has declared that peace will be maintained no matter what, with Bartha personally proclaiming that Roth’s death will not be vain.\n\n With the military firmly in control it would be wise to maintain public support, we could do this by continuing Roth’s progressive policies. However Bartha’s advisers have also advised we hastily militarise the nation to prepare for a potential war with Romania."
ban.19.a: "Banat needs to buff up its military, quickly!"
ban.19.b: "Keep Roth's policies!"

ban.20.t: "Banat under attack!"
ban.20.d: "The newly founded Republic of Banat has already caused instability in the region, its presence alone has weakened the Romanian menace. Therefore the recent news of war between Banat and Romania is concerning, not only is Banat a potential ally but it has a significant monarchist presence who we could possess great influence over. Although many see no point in intervening in a war that clearly will be won by Romania, there are some close to the Tsar who have advised us to take action for the reasons already mentioned. A puppet to the north could be useful however at what cost..."
ban.20.a: "Intervene!"
ban.20.b: "Who cares about Banat? Romania? Idiots."

ban.21.t: "Banat is under attack!"
ban.21.d: "The vile Romanian menace have taken up arms and are marching towards our borders! Despite the military being in control of the nation it is clear that Banat severely lacks the manpower to combat a far larger country. Codreanu and his hordes of murderous legionaries will surely take no mercy on us, and so we must rally the masses to the defence of the homeland. The military council has presented two plans, one calls for an extensive military draft. Anyone able to hold a rifle will take up arms and serve, whilst it would be incredibly unpopular we have little choice but to force our citizens to fight. The other plan calls for us to rally around the exiled monarch, Carol. The monarchist militias are powerful and have strong connections to the citizenry and leadership in Romania, by declaring loyalty to the monarchy we could sway Romanian support against their own government. What shall we do?"
ban.21.a: "Execute an extreme draft."
ban.21.b: "Rally the Monarchists!"

ban.22.t: "Royalists Seize Power!"
ban.22.d: "Since Codreanu took control over Romania, he has purged much of the traditionalist monarchist influences in the government. Despite declaring himself a staunch monarchist, Codreanu’s plan for total control would be stifled by a powerful and beloved monarch who might oppose him. These purged royalists fled Romania, and when Banat declared its independence they found a home in which they could plan their return without interference.Uniting under the banner of the ‘National Renaissance Front’.\n\nThat plan has finally been put into motion, royalists rallying around Carol II have taken control. Supported by much of the citizenry of Banat, the royalists have also found support amongst the Romanian populace despite government crackdows. As expected, the first proclamation made by the FRN is the restoration of the monarchy, the crowning of King Carol II will be held within the following weeks!"
ban.22.a: "Begin proceedings for a formal coronation."

ban.23.t: "The Iron Guard Coup"
ban.23.d: "The legions of Horia Sima have marched on Banat, raising the Guardist banner above the capital building and firing upon any who stand in their way. It was no secret that there were those within the military who sympathized with Sima, that combined with funding and weaponry supplied by the Romanians allowed for the Iron Guard to take control largely unopposed. Taking to the streets, Sima’s men have already got to work tearing down Banatian flags and insignia, in their place is the Cross of Archangel Michael, a signifier of the new regime and a new era for Banat."
ban.23.a: "A new Banat rises..."

ban.24.t: "Whispers of a Coup on Banat"
ban.24.d: "Codreanu has been notified of a potential coup being planned in Banat, comrade Horia Sima who leads the Banatian Iron Guard is rumoured to be stockpiling on weaponry and preparing for a march on the capital. If Sima is victorious it would be a huge success for Romania, an allied state in the region would provide the perfect staging point for an attack on the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Let us hope for the elimination of the traitorous Banatian military command under General Albert Bartha, and exiled royalist troublemakers!"
ban.24.a: "Let us hope..."

ban.25.t: "Royalist Rumors"
ban.25.d: "The question of the monarchy has always been complex, whilst Codreanu accepts and supports the traditionalist spirit of a monarchy he despises the corruption and abuse of power by the royals. It is because of this that he ordered for a purge on monarchists who could potentially stoke anti-Legionary rhetoric, these monarchists have shown their true colours by fleeing to the Republic of Banat. According to rumours, the exiled ‘National Renaissance Front’ has begun to plan a restoration of King Carol II, not only that but they plan on destroying what influence we have in the region. Let us hope that these rumours are false..."
ban.25.a: "This will amount to nothing."

ban.26.t: "The Crowning of King Carol II"
ban.26.d: "At last, the Kingdom of Romania has returned. It may not be at its heartland, but soon that will change - and change begins today. His Majesty King Carol II, King of the Kingdom of Romania in Exile, has been crowned today in Temes. Cheers across the Romanian royalists stuck in the despicable Iron Guard Romania have erupted, and for once the Royalists have succeeded. The new Kingdom is reorganizing, mobilizing, and rearming, overseen by His Majesty. Today begins the Reconquest, the retaking of Romania from the tyranny that inhabits it, and furthermore the retaking of the hearts of all Romanians."
ban.26.a: "Hurrah! Long Live the King!"

ban.27.t: "The Question of Romania"
ban.27.d: "Now that we are fully in control we must decide how to progress further with our Romanian allies, the most commonly held view is that we should immediately push to unite the two nations. Our interests lie with Codreanu and so it would make sense to enact a union, however there is also the potential to expand Sima’s own powerbase. By maintaining independence Sima can achieve his dream of leading his very own regime, rather than being sidelined by Codreanu..."
ban.27.a: "We are merely allies."
ban.27.b: "Enact a union!"

ban.28.t: "Royalist Revolution!"
ban.28.d: "Our spies under the command of Horia Sima have informed us of their infiltration of the National Renaissance Front, according to them the rumours of a royalist coup are indeed true. The monarchists are currently attempting to win over the support of the military and have already forged connections with Albert Bartha’s advisors. An opposing Kingdom declaring legitimacy over Romania is the last thing we need, Sima’s men are awaiting confirmation from Codreanu to sabotage the FRN’s plans."
ban.28.a: "Take 'em down!"

ban.29.t: "Royalists in Control of Banat!"
ban.29.d: "The dastardly monarchists have taken control over Banat! Our spies acted too little and too late, failing to prevent the FRN from allying with the Bantian military. With the royalists in control it is only a matter of time until they declare Caroll II, King of all of Romania, a move that would de-legitimize Codreanu’s power over the nation! Romanian military command is pushing for immediate action, these traitors cannot be allowed to oppose the rule of the Iron Guard..."
ban.29.a: "We should do something about this..."

ban.30.t: "The Kingdom of Romania requests our help!"
ban.30.d: "The newly restored Kingdom of Romania has requested our aid, stating the potential for the Romnian National Legionary State to launch further attacks. With a friendly monarchy installed in a nation nearby, it is useful to keep them in our good graces. Surrounded by the Serbs, Greeks and Legionary Romanians, the young kingdom is one of our few friends. Therefore we should decide how best to aid them, or if we should provide them with anything at all. After all, despite the benefits of friendship, we still have our own national interest to take care of first."
ban.30.a: "Send them supplies."
ban.30.b: "Send an offer of alliance."
ban.30.c: "We cannot help you."

ban.31.t: "The Kingdom of Romania requests our help!"
ban.31.d: "The newly established Kingdom of Romania has requested we aid them in their war with the Iron Guard, Codreanu’s regime has been a thorn in our backside ever since he ascended to power. It would be beneficial for us to support an opponent to Codreanu, however perhaps we should seek council with Austria before we commit to anything..."
ban.31.a: "Send them supplies."
ban.31.b: "Send the word over to Austria."
ban.31.c: "We cannot help you."

ban.32.t: "Bulgaria Extends Offer of Alliance"
ban.32.d: "The Tsardom of Bulgaria has offered us an alliance, we both share friendly monarchies and are united in our common enemy, the Iron Guard regime. Codreanu has been a vocal opponent of Bulgaria, his anti-Bulgarian rhetoric naturally aligns us with the Bulgarians. However many still remember the bitter defeat at the hand of the Tsar's soldiers..."
ban.32.a: "Why would we ever say no?"
ban.32.b: "No."

ban.33.t: "The Kingdom of Romania requests our help!"
ban.33.d: "The newly restored Kingdom of Romania has requested our aid, stating the common threat of the Romanian National Legionary State which could potentially launch attacks against us. With a friendly monarchy installed in a nation to our south, we have extra defenses against the Iron Guard and Serbs. Furthermore Cocdreanu has proved himself to be a menace for the Balkans, his elimination would be very beneficial for us. Should we offer our aid or first focus on maintaining stability in the empire?"
ban.33.a: "The Iron Guard is a threat, let us help!"
ban.33.b: "Invite them to an alliance."
ban.33.c: "We cannot help you."

ban.34.t: "Austria Requests Alliance"
ban.34.d: "Austria’s subjects demand more autonomy Vienna is also being sidelined by their superior German allies. It is therefore no surprise that the Austrians are looking for new allies, we have received an invitation to form an alliance between our two nations. Do we accept?"
ban.34.a: "This is the best case scenario!"
ban.34.b: "Why? We want more of your land!"

ban.35.t: "Radio broadcasts hijacked!"
ban.35.d: "Banatian secret services have infiltrated key Romanian radio stations! These stations are a core part of the Iron Guard’s propaganda arm, losing access to our own voice is an embarrassing defeat. The Banatians have now begun to broadcast slanderous messages of Codreanu being a traitor to his own people, they accuse the Iron Guard of oppressing its own citizens! These lies are a crushing blow to the military morale, a shocking turn of events that the Conducător will be extremely displeased with."
ban.35.a: "The Exiles really are a problem..."

ban.36.t: "The Royalists Make their Move"
ban.36.d: "The false Kingdom of Romania has declared war on us, stating their duty to return order to the peoples of Romania. They have accused Conducător Codreanu of betraying his nation by purging the monarchy, a deceitful lie considering Codreanu’s undying love for a Romanian monarchy. Carol II has proved himself to be a failed monarch, interested more in his own debaucherous lifestyle than doing his God given duty, therefore we cannot allow him to succeed. Our brave legionary warriors will fight back these invaders, the traitors will be punished!"
ban.36.a: "We shall crush these invaders!"

ban.38.t: "The war is won!"
ban.38.d: "The tyrannical Conducător has been crushed by our superior forces! The legionaries have fled Romania with their tails tucked between their legs, unable to match our fighting spirit! As our forces march through the streets of Bucharest flying the Romanian tricolour, we have been met with a jubilant populace, eager to greet their king. It is now time to get to work, the true Kingdom of Romania must destroy all legionary remnants of society. In the name of God and King Carol II we will smash the Iron Guard completely!"
ban.38.a: "We did it!"

ban.39.t: "Hey, why are you using the console?"
ban.39.d: "Are you debugging, or are you cheating?"
ban.39.a: "RIP Iron Guard Romania"

ban.40.t: "Dreams of a Greater Romania"
ban.40.d: "With the Legionary State crushed and our partial homeland restored it is time to set our sights on the rest of our lost land. The Weltkrieg defeat tore apart the Romanian peoples, our citizens being split up into different nations. We have been bestowed the duty to unite every single Romanian, we shall not rest until Greater Romania is a reality!"
ban.40.a: "There is hope yet."

ban.41.t: "Romanian Syndicalists Appear"
ban.41.d: "As our forces begin to rebuild Romania, we have been met with a resurgence of political movements formerly outlawed by the Iron Guard regime. Codreanu had many enemies, enemies who have now resurfaced to celebrate the liberation of Romania, most of these are supportive of the King even if they are liberals and reformers. However there are some who have not welcomed us with open arms, the Romanian Syndicalist movement has taken to the streets to protest against the king. Inspired by the revolutions in Britain, France and Italy, with Codreanu gone they now see the current situation as a perfect opportunity to launch their own political uprising."
ban.41.a: "We just got here..."

ban.42.t: "Romania Backs Transylvanian Separatists"
ban.42.d: "With Romania now under Carol’s rule their focus has shifted, the Iron Guard are no longer a threat and so we lack uniting under a shared enemy. The Kingdom of Romanian has now decided to pursue a policy of claiming legitimacy over lands that possess a significant Romanian population. One such target is Transylvian, if our reports are correct then we are to believe that the Romanians are responsible for the recent anti-Hungarian protests in the region. We must not allow for such instability to be provoked by a foreign nation. Yet our power is limited and any direct action could escalate ethnic tension..."
ban.42.a: "This has gone too far already."
ban.42.b: "This makes no difference."

ban.43.t: "Romanian-Backed Separatists Declare Transylvania!"
ban.43.d: "The Trannyslvianians have risen up against us! Backed by the Kingdom of Romania, these treasonous rebels are now declaring themselves independent from our rule! Such a move would have been unthinkable before, however now with the backing of Romania it seems these protestors have developed the gall to openly oppose our benevolent rule. If we do not strike quickly these protestors could spread further and inspire the other minorities to revolt!"
ban.43.a: "Let's destroy these rebels!"
ban.43.b: "Show Romania who's boss!"

ban.44.t: "The Revolt Fails"
ban.44.d: "Despite our support and backing of the Transylvanian rebels they have failed to resist the Hungarian army, as expected the Hungarians reacted quickly by marching towards the rebel strongholds. What was not expected is that the rebels would fall so quickly, their leaders have been rounded up at gunpoint and are awaiting trial for treason. Should we intervene to defend our fellow Romanian brethren?"
ban.44.a: "Attack anyway!"
ban.44.b: "Wait."

ban.45.t: "Romanian Activists Backed"
ban.45.d: "Our brave patriots have resisted the Hungarian invaders, with Transylvania still united under an independent banner we can rally our citizens to remain loyal in these trying times. Many of these citizens have been calling for unity with the Kingdom of Romania, it is no secret that much of our funding and support has been from King Carol II. Now with the Transylvanian military in a position to safeguard the region it seems the Kingdom has turned its interests towards supporting pro-union civilian groups."
ban.45.a: "We just got here..."

ban.46.t: "Romanian Syndicalists Appear"
ban.46.d: "Prominent left-wing politician, Petru Groza, has been uniting the formerly fractured labour movement. Infighting and factionalism had prevented leftists from uniting under a single banner, however Groza has managed to do the previously thought impossible. By appealing to syndicalists, socialists and even some social democrats, he has formed a popular front that hopes to break through into politics. "
ban.46.a: "We just got here..."

ban.47.t: "The Revolt Fails"
ban.47.d: "Despite Romanian support and backing of the Transylvanian rebels they have failed to resist the Hungarian army, as expected the Hungarians reacted quickly by marching towards the rebel strongholds. What was not expected is that the rebels would fall so quickly, their leaders have been rounded up at gunpoint and are awaiting trial for treason. Should we intervene to defend our fellow Romanian brethren?"
ban.47.a: "Attack anyway!"
ban.47.b: "We can wait."

ban.48.t: "Using the Regained Population"
ban.48.d: "With our newly conquered land we are now ruling over a much larger populace, a populace who we can now use to rebuild the economy and industry of Romania. The war wreaked havoc on much of the urban areas. Before we can fully industrialise we must rebuild the lives of the people, buildings be replaced, factories must be reopened and industry must resume. With this important task we can use our large labour force to begin, how should we use them? Do we focus them on rebuilding industry or use them for higher-calls labour?"
ban.48.a: "Direct them towards industrial development."
ban.48.b: "Higher-class work is in shortage."

ban.49.t: "Petru Groza's Debut!"
ban.49.d: "It is safe to say that due to the backing of Codreanu, our regime is in a strong position to dictate over the people of Banat. Few would openly oppose our military might, with our propaganda plastered across the nation and legionnaires patrolling the streets such rebellious behaviour would surely be suicidal...\n\nHowever there is one figure who is either brave or foolish enough to openly attack Horia Sima, Petru Groza commands a sizable force of syndicalists who wish to tear down the newly formed Iron Guard government. Even we cannot deny his charismatic rhetoric, hence why he has the potential to be more than just a nuisance. The threat of a left-wing uprising so soon after we have barely marched on the Banatian Senate is not something Sima expected, despite this we are prepared for further violence. The legionaries are eager for more battle!"
ban.49.a: "Kill that rabble rouser!"

ban.50.t: "Petru Groza's Call"
ban.50.d: "Petru Groza has now begun organizing mass rallies in defiance to Sima’s orders that all political opposition is forbidden. Groza has been able to address thousands of angry workers, taking advantage of their temporary troubles by spewing devilish lies! His vision for the nation is one of moral degeneracy and anarchy! His very existence has now become a direct threat, we must act quickly before this gets out of hand."
ban.50.a: "We said find him!"

ban.51.t: "Rakosi and Groza Congratulate the Attackers"
ban.51.d: "The Temes Bombing has drawn attention from everyone, literally everyone, in Banat, to nearby neighbors. It has especially attracted praise from two radical figures: Matyas Rakosi and Petru Groza. They congratulated the attacks, praising it and the low death toll as a "attack on tyranny's land". Many people are also somewhat content and are even willing to look past the bombing.\nWhy does our population hold so much hatred towards us?"
ban.51.a: "Terrorist!"

ban.52.t: "The Timisoara Bombing"
ban.52.d: "A taller building in Timisoara was suddenly toppled by an ear-piercing explosion, which caused a multitude of buildings to collapse. The buildings collapsed over fleeing cars, over commuters...\nThe deaths have now been tallied, only standing at six, but the destruction is immeasurable. The attack was clearly because of Roth's assassination, and because of that not everyone is mourning over the bombing..."
ban.52.a: "How radical! I hate it!"

ban.53.t: "The Execution of Otto Roth"
ban.53.d: "Otto Roth was dragged out in front of the government palace, limp but clearly alive, battered and bruised. To him a sudden weeping occurred, and it wasn't from one, two, or three people - it was the crowd. The police kept these protestors at bay as the guillotine was raised, and Roth placed inside. "Die!" shouted Sima, as the rope was pulled, and Roth's head hit the bucket and leaked blood. A gasp of horror reached the crowd, who started to flee or attack the police. They weren't successful, but this will have a great effect on our population."
ban.53.a: "This will be burned through their skulls."

ban.54.t: "Petru Groza's Actions in Banat"
ban.54.d: "There is a Romanian syndicalist under the name of Petru Groza, who has proven himself to be a true Syndicalist in the way that he is attempting to spread the revolution and his economic policy, which closely relates with that of the previous Banat leader, Otto Roth. As of now, Banat is National Populist, but that can be changed..."
ban.54.a: "Offer him our support."
ban.54.b: "Sorry."

ban.55.t: "The French Endorse Groza"
ban.55.d: "After gaining insight into Banat and its inner workings, the French have publicly endorsed the "Banat Revolution" and its leaders, specifically Petru Groza, and to a lesser extent, Matyas Rakosi. THey wish that these figures in our nation will spread the Revolution, which is entirely unacceptable! Hopefully the new French influence won't have a large impact on our nation."
ban.55.a: "Horrible!"

ban.56.t: "Rakosi's Call to Arms"
ban.56.d: "Matyas Rakosi, catering to the many socialists of Banat, is attempting to radicalize the Banatian people. Having issued many calls to revolution today and previous weeks, the influential figure is trying his best to anger the Banatian populace, to bring them to an open arms revolt, a civil war. His speeches really are getting to the people, and what's worse is that Petru Groza is doing the exact same thing..."
ban.56.a: "He and Groza are criminals!"

ban.57.t: "Socialist Uprising!"
ban.57.d: "The Socialists in Banat, after prolonged provocation and riling, are done. Today they picked up any weapon they could, and took over the countryside, then the towns, and then the cities. The soldiers had no idea what was coming to them, so they were routed and initially beaten. Now the revolution converges on Timisoara, where the army shoots anyone they see. Muzzle flashes appear from windows from time to time, and objects are hurtled off ledges, from small objects to large civilian appliances. We're on our last legs."
ban.57.a: "Defend the State at all costs!"

ban.58.t: "Army Deployed"
ban.58.d: "It is clear that the police alone are unable to hold off the protests in Banat. Thus Horia Sima authorized use of the army as a police force, and marched the small army out into protest-riddled areas. The people are enraged at this act, and are throwing projectiles at soldiers. Of course, we can't shoot them, so the soldiers are forced to toil onwards, or just simply arrest them. However, the sight of the army has scared off many would-be anarchists, so it's at least doing something of note."
ban.58.a: "This will do something."

ban.59.t: "The Red and Redder Nation"
ban.59.d: "The Sima regime has fallen due to the mass riots and protests all across the nation. Two revolutionary figures stand at odds, ready to take leadership of the country. Those leaders are Matyas Rakosi and Petru Groza. Sima still holds a little power, and is attempting to invite the Romanians for an intervention into the country. Who comes out on top in this situation?"
ban.59.a: "Groza establishes the Banatian Syndicate!"
ban.59.b: "Rakosi's Totalists exterminate all opposition!"
ban.59.c: "Plead to Romania! Help!"

ban.60.t: "Roth Remembrance March"
ban.60.d: "In protest of the "unfair execution" of the former President, Otto Roth, many residents of Banat have taken to the streets, marching in long, thick columns while shouting words and phrases praising Otto Roth, and denouncing the government. Red banners are waved, not our red and black banner, just solid red. They are everywhere, but we have picked out a few leaders. How do we treat these unruly protestors? Shall we let it sit, or take action and arrest them all? Neither is really a good choice..."
ban.60.a: "Arrest all involved."
ban.60.b: "Issue a protest."

ban.61.t: "The Four Squares Protest"
ban.61.d: "More to add to our woes. Today, Groza and his ever-growing and radicalizing crowd of hooligans staged a protest on the four squares of Timisoara - Victory Square, Union Square, Liberty Square, and Saint George Square. Vehicles block the path of incoming police responses, objects and abuses are hurled across the streets and buildings, and violence is rampant between crowds of differing parties. It is a mob versus mob battle, and the police are doing their best to suppress the violence, but there is simply too much.\nPetru Groza, again, has praised the protestors and the protest in their job, and encouraged it. Our few hospitals are becoming overwhelmed with battered patients quickly, and it seems ever more likely that our new Banat is to fall. However, Sima has kept his grip and stance, and today he and his loyal government met today on how to disperse the protests. Of course, there were two primary suggestions. Fire, or wait.\nAnd in the end, Horia Sima said..."
ban.61.a: "It'll calm down."
ban.61.b: "This one won't be in any history books! Weapons free!"

ban.62.t: "The Lone Man"
ban.62.d: "A lone man stood in front of the army today, the few tanks owned by Banat. The man did not let any pass, he watched as the tanks tried to move forward without running him over. For many hours, a line of tanks was blocked by him, as he was slowly joined by many from the crowd, forming a human shield across the road where the tanks attempted to pass. He is revered by the protestors because of his brave actions. Let's hope he doesn't give them any... ideas."
ban.62.a: "How brave."

ban.63.t: "The Army Gets Out of Control"
ban.63.d: "The Army has lost all sort of order. They browse the streets and crowds on their own, as the officers struggle to reorganize them. Some soldiers have noticed the anarchy, and have taken to firing at unarmed civilians and part of the crowd. Many deaths have occurred from this, but many of those perpetrators are punished and executed themselves. The people are losing patience very, very quickly... we must do something!"
ban.63.a: "Encourage the army secretly."
ban.63.b: "Despicable! Punish the involved!"

ban.64.t: "Banat Begs to Join Us!"
ban.64.d: "The Banat Republic is in such a state of anarchy that they are on their knees, begging for annexation. How pitiful of them, surely we will let their poor country in! Horia Sima has not been a good leader to them, but we will be..."
ban.64.a: "Ha! Come here!"

ban.65.t: "The Socialist Republic Formed"
ban.65.d: "The Socialist Republic of Banat has been formed under the leadership of Petru Groza. Already wiping out all of the changes to the government made by Horia Sima, Groza has essentially reverted the government to a radical Rothian state. He plans on expanding socialism throughout the country, while also spreading the Revolution at a later date. Of course, these motives are unknown to most everyone in Banat and abroad."
ban.65.a: "Any more regime changes?"

ban.66.t: "[BAN.GetNameDef] asks to join the Reichspakt"
ban.66.d: "The [BAN.GetName] has requested to join the Reichspakt as a formal ally of ours, and cooperate together in defending German hegemony and enacting the will of Germany. What do we say?"
ban.66.a: "Splendid!"
ban.66.b: "Balkan peoples are no good."

ban.67.t: "[BAN.GetNameDef] asks to join the Entente"
ban.67.d: "The [BAN.GetName] has requested to join the Entente as a formal ally of ours, and cooperate together in defeating socialism. What do we say?"
ban.67.a: "Splendid!"
ban.67.b: "Balkan peoples are no good."

ban.68.t: "[BAN.GetNameDef] requests to join the Belgrade Pact"
ban.68.d: "The [BAN.GetName] has requested to join the Belgrade Pact as a formal ally of ours, and cooperate together in defeating Austrian influence. What do we say?"
ban.68.a: "Splendid!"
ban.68.b: "You are worth nothing."

ban.69.t: "Romania suggests an alliance"
ban.69.d: "The Kingdom of Romania has suggested a pact! We don't have much history with them, and we may even oppose them, so what do we say?"
ban.69.a: "Of course, friend!"
ban.69.b: "Why should we ever?"

ban.70.t: "The War Ends"
ban.70.d: "The war is over, and Banat stands victorious alongside us. We made a deal, a deal where we join them, as they helped us secure some sort of independence. But that deal gives up our independence! Thus many Transylvanians are fighting to keep away from Banat.\nWhat's our stance to this promise we made to Banat? Are we going to honor it, or no?"
ban.70.a: "We will gladly join you."
ban.70.b: "Why should we honor that?"

ban.71.t: "Transylvania resists annexation!"
ban.71.d: "The idiot Transylvanians have denied the deal we made and are attempting to keep their independence! Their armies are preparing for war against us, as it is thought that we will be ready to take what is ours as per the deal. We of course should have none of this. We should appear strong, but they may be too strong. What's our response to these foolish Transylvanians? Do we destroy them where they stand, or do we just really not care all that much?"
ban.71.a: "Fools!"
ban.71.b: "We don't care."

ban.72.t: "Protests Disperse"
ban.72.d: "The protests that have plagued the country since the death of Otto Roth have stopped at last. The right combinations of actions, not the moral ones, were essential to ceasing these protests. No longer shall they topple our nation.\nThe solid red banner will never fly over Banat again. The socialists are no longer a threat."
ban.72.a: "Good!"

ban.73.t: "[BAN.GetNameDef] requests to participate in the Internationale"
ban.73.d: "The [BAN.GetName] has requested to join the Internationale as a formal ally of ours, and cooperate together in spreading the Revolution. They hold plans themselves to conquer the Balkans for socialism, but to us, it is unknown how they will ever do that, being so small. Nevertheless, what is our response to this request of theirs?"
ban.73.a: "Splendid!"
ban.73.b: "Balkan peoples are no good."

ban.74.t: "The Four Year Plan"
ban.74.d: "Our great leader Mátyás Rákosi has enacted a plan for the industry, the Four-Year Plan. This plan tells that all the workers shall work especially towards innovation, alongside their own work. Shall we improve our technology, we shall improve our productivity too. The plan begins at dawn."
ban.74.a: "Let it begin..."

ban.75.t: "The Four Year Plan Progresses"
ban.75.d: "The gears go on uninterrupted, the workers continue toiling away. Praise thy worker for continuing on this long, as yet again we have reached another milestone in the Four-Year Plan. We shall see benefit from this, and hopefully even more benefit later! For this progress report, we have a couple new factories and innovative ideas towards industry."
ban.75.a: "This is thanks to the workers."

ban.76.t: "A Mechanical Banat"
ban.76.d: "The mechanical parts of our Banat, in the form of the grand factories over our nation, emit the signs of life of our nation, smoke. The factories work so diligently. It would be criminal to not praise them, their work, their continued feeding of Banat. Life flows out of these factories, and that life will empower the rest of Banat.\nWe must always be sure to keep our factories motivated, though, as it does get repetitive there. Workers truly are the life of a nation."
ban.76.a: "The factories go on uninterrupted."

ban.77.t: "Mátyás Rákosi's New Banat"
ban.77.d: "Mátyás Rákosi has done it. The dark red tide has claimed Banat too, and now the crimson banner is washed with new meaning. The new Banat, under Mátyás Rákosi, aspires to take Hungary, to spread the revolution, to bring prosperity to the world through whatever means possible.\nThe Balkans will turn red in the wake of our nation."
ban.77.a: "A red tide will wash over Earth too in time."

ban.78.t: "Rákosi Warns the Government"
ban.78.d: "Mátyás Rákosi, Totalist of Banat, being the "fortune teller" of Banat as per usual, has sent us a warning.\nIt reads out that Banat will get nowhere under our current system of government, and that the Revolution will not spare us. He says it will arrive soon, with burning black smoke and smoldering buildings. He says that Banat's people are getting angry, and are ready to accept the better way of life - Totalism."
ban.78.a: "Stupid rabble rouser."

ban.79.t: "French Support Arrives"
ban.79.d: "The French were late to deliver us our equipment, but they said it was just the fact that we needed to be stable enough so that the equipment didn't get into the wrong hands. Now, though, we have French weapons in our arsenal, ready to spread the Revolution onwards!\nThree hurrahs for France, and three hurrahs for Banat!"
ban.79.a: "Send our highest thank you!"

ban.80.t: "Magyarization of Banat"
ban.80.d: "Although Banat seceded to prevent war, and was ruled by a Swabian at one point, it appears that ethnic diversity is no longer important there, for according to them, the Banatians, their population must all be Hungarians. Of course, this may be beneficial to us, but then again, it is likely that their Totalist government is not friendly with us at all, and perhaps is even a threat to our nation... God forbid they attack us."
ban.80.a: "What is going on down there?"

ban.81.t: "The Red Tide"
ban.81.d: "The Red Tide, the Revolution, the Crimson Wave, call it what you like, for it will come to you next. The revolution moves onwards!\nOur armies will arrive and liberate your capital, burn the buildings of the oppressors!\nThen you shall become free, as the workers shall become more powerful than ever, elevated to a status in which they matter.\nThe Revolution progresses onwards, two nations at a time. Some day we shall see a Socialist World Republic."
ban.81.a: "Europe bleeds."

ban.82.t: "The Aspect of Guaranteed Benevolence"
ban.82.d: "While we have successfully seized power over the state, many are wary of our government and our vision, not understanding that we intend on providing a brighter future for our nation. We have conquered land, but we have yet to conquer the hearts of the people. With this in mind, General Secretary Rákosi has launched a series of public works projects in order to shore up public support. Across the nation the foundations of schools, hospitals, food banks, and monuments are being constructed and all will be completed before the year ends. As expected, our actions have been met with overwhelming approval from the public, solidifying our leader's image as a true man of the people and increasing our influence over the masses!"
ban.82.a: "The only speakers are the enlightened."

ban.83.t: "The Gray Army"
ban.83.d: "While the army itself is a capable force ready to spread our vision across the Danube, they are but one fundamental part of the wars to come. While our brave soldiers are ever eager to cut down the state's enemies, they require the arms and munitions in order to do so, products constantly churned out of our factories in order to keep our war machine running. Yet, insidious elements lurk among our productive workers, sabotaging our efforts and raising dissent to hinder us. If we are to achieve our goals, we must deal with such sinister forces immediately. To combat these traitors, we shall create a new army; one that will act as the guardians and watchers of the laborers, protecting them and rooting out any false shepherds that seek to lead them astray. This army will be known as the Gray Army, our eyes, ears, and hands in industry inorder to ensure the productivity of each and every worker!"
ban.83.a: "They will keep the progress steady."

ban.84.t: "The Economy of the Revitalized [BAN.GetName]"
ban.84.d: "Ever since our country's birth from chaos, its economy has been strained to its very limits as we struggled to find our place in the world. Now however, through reform and necessary sacrifice, we have been able to drag our economy out from the gutter and bring Banat economic stability once more! Employment is at an all-time low, the factories are producing their products more than ever, and the income for the average citizen has gone up! Much more can be done, but for now, we may rest on our laurels for a time."
ban.84.a: "Wonderful."

ban.85.t: "Sima's Rhetoric"
ban.85.d: "Sima's speeches have gained a reputation for their aggressive manner, bold claims, and promises. He backs them all up so well, using such diction that the population has only the choice to believe him.\nSima isn't the smartest in some places, but he sure knows how to use his words to his advantage. That's a necessary part of being a politician, and even more importantly, a leader."
ban.85.a: "Applause!"

ban.86.t: "Arrival of a Census"
ban.86.d: "An unmarked letter appeared in the mailbox of the government today.\n In it was a familiar name, the BPC, the Banat Population Census, which was the first of the nation. In it detailed the population, occupation, family count, the usual. But what stuck out to Sima was the party popularities. Above all, high and proud, the Iron Guard ruled the people! They were accepted by the people at last.\nA great, but easily forgettable, day for Banat."
ban.86.a: "They have no claims to us anymore."

ban.87.t: "Soup Kitchens Opened"
ban.87.d: "The dictatorship under our great leader, Horia Sima, only gets better. Under popular demand, the poor of Banat have been helped with the opening of soup kitchens in cities across the nation. The soup is free, and the government pays for it. Essentially free food. Who doesn't like free food? But it's only for the poor, and Sima knows just how the poor look and act."
ban.87.a: "I like it!"

ban.88.t: "Captive Praises the Iron Guard"
ban.88.d: "A captive of ours, under the appearance of a trusted individual, has publicly praised the Iron Guard here in Banat and afar in Romania. Being such a normal man, maybe it will make other citizens rethink their stance towards us, as we are not as popular in this country as we should be.\n All should listen to Horia Sima, Conducator of Iron Guard Banat!"
ban.88.a: "Keep talking."

ban.89.t: "The Gray Army Mobilizes"
ban.89.d: "The industrial police must go to the fight too. They are our most prized soldiers, the finest men of Banat. They have picked up their arms yet again, not to the workers, but to the enemy at hand.\nBlack boots and gray fog will wash over what land was once theirs. They shall march through, setting everything ablaze and turning the landscape into a blackened wasteland, unfit for living in. Their cities too, set alight by flamethrowers who spew flames with unusual distance, will burn.\nThey will burn. They are scared..."
ban.89.a: "On to the fight we go."

ban.90.t: "Military Mission with Banat?"
ban.90.d: "A diplomatic offer has arrived from Banat today. As of recent, the regional division of the Iron Guard has seized power within Banat and the new government seeks to establish closer relations with us and proposes for a joint military mission to be held between our armed forces. While many within our government approve, others see the Iron Guard in Banat as a treacherous rogue branch and oppose any form of cooperation. Should we take Banat up on their offer?"
ban.90.a: "Yes, my brother!"
ban.90.b: "No, traitor."

ban.91.t: "Romania agrees to cooperation!"
ban.91.d: "Joyous news! Romania has eagerly agreed to our offer! Now we shall walk forward towards the future as friends and allies!"
ban.91.a: "Let us share the reward together."

ban.92.t: "Romania says no to cooperation!"
ban.92.d: "Much to our surprise and horror, Romania has rejected our offer and even denounced us as traitorous opportunists!"
ban.92.a: "Dishonorable."

ban.93.t: "Research Pact with Banat"
ban.93.d: "As a result of increased interaction with one another, our allies in Banat have come with a proposal for both parties to sign a research pact where both would share technology and other scientific advancements with one another while our scientists collaborate for the benefit of both nations. While we wouldn't have much to lose, some skeptics are doubtful of how useful such a pact would be for us, seeing it as only benefiting the less-developed Banat."
ban.93.a: "Even they can help us."
ban.93.b: "That's a little too far."

ban.94.t: "Romania agrees to research cooperation!"
ban.94.d: "Romania has agreed to our proposal. With our limited resources, surely such a pact would benefit us immensely! Cheers to our friends in Romania!"
ban.94.a: "All according to plan."

ban.95.t: "Kidnapping Petru Groza"
ban.95.d: "The Syndicalist Petru Groza, more known as a traitor, has been struck by our police at what he would consider an untimely moment. It is not untimely for us, just perfect! He was dragged out of his hiding place, scraping against hard pavement, tied up and then thrown in a car, before the car sped off into the fog. Once he arrived, Rakosi wanted to see him personally, and Groza couldn't do much as he was jostled around violently. A little debate occurred, ending him versus life in prison. But of course..."
ban.95.a: "End the bastard."

ban.96.t: "The Wall Rises"
ban.96.d: "Early in the morning of (date), the construction of a wall that has been spoken of and talked about feverishly over the past few weeks has finally begun. It is a top priority, and as such, is expected to be done rather quickly, even with the impressive amount of work it will take. The wall, it's idea which was created by our government, has been described as a protective measure to keep the reactionaries out of our new country. The threat from the outside is great, but the threat that is posed from the inside is even greater. As such, the wall will be built to keep informants from inside of our borders inside, until they have been found and apprehended. As it is, it is hoped to be a temporary measure, but there is no telling how long this temporary measure will be in place. Until that time has come, Banat will truly be an information sinkhole in the balkans, where nothing will come out except for what we desire to, and our plans will be safeguarded until our time has come to bring it to light."
ban.96.a: "§RKEEP IN§!"

ban.97.t: "Totalists in Transylvania"
ban.97.d: "It has come to our attention as of recently that a few groups of totalists in Transylvania have begun to make themselves somewhat known around their respective areas. As such, this has become of great interest to us, as Transylvania is a naturally tempting expansion route for Banat. So far, they have shown promise and have not been caught as of yet by the administrative elements in their own country, so as of right now that could be incredibly interesting for us. Along with this, they may be worth keeping tabs on and inspecting, to find out if they are worth supporting and arming in their plight against their enemies, and as an extension, enemies of our own country."
ban.97.a: "Send a few inspecting teams."

ban.98.t: "Discovery of a Great Wall"
ban.98.d: "A perplexing result from a citizen's erratic report has detailed the finding of a large wall that is present where our border with Banat once stayed. A government-sponsored expedition revealed that in fact there was actually a wall, one hundred percent silent. You could hear nothing through the wall, no chatter, no marching, no engines. It was an eerie silence..."
ban.98.a: "Where did they get all this material?"

ban.99.t: "Massing at the Gates"
ban.99.d: "The army masses at the gates of the Great Steel Wall of the Banat, marching impatiently around as they wait for our word. They are ready to bring the new Banat to Hungary, to spread Totalism to Hungary. The Massing at the Gates is unknown to all else, as it appears to be silent to the outsider.\nThe soldiers are speaking, they want the wall lowered! They are impatient! But they must realize that they are not the only ones who need to be ready, all of Banat needs to be ready."
ban.99.a: "The Lowering will bring victory."

ban.100.t: "Citizenry on Edge"
ban.100.d: "Recently it's been reported that the citizenry are becoming more and more agitated. There is no sure reason why this could be as it is right now, but there is some cause for concern due to this. As it is, it seems to have begun to plague all corners of society, and there is a strange, unprecedented feeling of unease permeating all throughout our society. Police have no exact ideas as to why this is, and it's beginning to cause discordance in the government as well. Some of the highest echelons worry that there is some sort of revolt or rebellion brewing, even without any actual signs of it outside of general agitation of the populace, which isn't exactly unheard of to begin with. For now, all we can do is wait and see what comes from this, but whatever it is it most likely cannot be good." 
ban.100.a: "I feel like something horrible is going to happen."

ban.101.t: "The Never-Seen Draft"
ban.101.d: "Day by day, the population is plucked from their homes and incorporated into our Army. Day by day, the Wall seems closer to lowering. Day by day, the uneducated Hungarians on the other side of the Wall get more nervous. Day by day, weapons go into the hands of the Army of Banat. Day by day, Banat gets stronger.\nIt is time for Banat to show themselves to the Hungarians, to unleash terror and fear upon them. Our armies will eradicate all life. Flames will reach in vain to the skies, a signal to all that we are not to be resisted. The Gray Army continues running the factories. The Red Army continues running the country. Rakosi continues his broadcasts. The walls have lowered.\nBanat is ready. Banat will show itself, show the world a real Revolution, and show the world what truly should happen here. The darkness will turn red in the dimming lights bathing the Hungarian people. Hungarians are our right. Their will is what will drive this Revolution, along with our loyalists back in the Banat. No one will expect the Banatian Revolution."
ban.101.a: "We are ready for this war."

ban.102.t: "The Army Collapses"
ban.102.d: "The Never-Seen Draft has proven to be too much on both our soldiers and our people. The army has begun mass mutinies and rebellions, making coordination and continued resistance futile. They are no longer willing to fight, and the people back home roar for the repealing of the draft and the exemption of all affected from further service. Surely we will lose this war now, there is absolutely no way we can win with an uncooperative and disintegrated army."
ban.102.a: "No... this wasn't the plan!"

ban.103.t: "The New Hungarian Regime"
ban.103.d: "The red banner flies over Budapest with mercy, as the old red, white, and green flags are taken down and replaced with the red banner of the Revolution. The capital is still Budapest, of course. The Revolutionary Hungarian Union has been proclaimed, and expresses its intent to further spread the Revolution to both its new and old neighbors.\nProtests line our new streets, against the idea of Totalism - they will accept in time. With patience the riots will disperse, and we will force our will if that is a necessary maneuver."
ban.103.a: "Our duty is complete."

ban.104.t: "Slovak Revolution!"
ban.104.d: "The Slovaks have been the hotspot of anti-government activities ever since the establishment of the Revolutionary Hungarian Union. Now they have intensified their struggle, taking up arms, accepting Slovaks into proper infantry divisions, and beginning a southwards march. At this point it is evident that the Slovaks are in open rebellion against our rule, which will not last long. Their heads will line their streets once we're done with them, and they will serve as a perfect example of what not to do in our country."
ban.104.a: "Aren't you guys Hungarians?"

ban.105.t: "The White Peace"
ban.105.d: "The Slovaks have proven themselves to exceed our expectations. They hold numerous vital lands, and it is obvious that the war will not progress any more to our advantage. THe government has called an emergency meeting, and it was all agreed that peace was to be signed.\nThe peace, signed by both Slovak and Hungarian representatives, allows for Slovakia to become a free nation and force us to cede small portions of land to them. This is both humiliating and horrible."
ban.105.a: "We will return."

ban.106.t: "Rounding Up Criminals"
ban.106.d: "The criminals and "freedom fighters" that walk the plains of this new Hungary have all walked into the cells of our prisons, holed up and ready to be dished out punishments. There is no doubt in any of their minds what they will be meeting, but they surely know it is their end."
ban.106.a: "The firing squad will see to them."

ban.107.t: "The Otto Roth Memorial Plaza"
ban.107.d: "After Horia Sima defaced and vandalized Otto Roth, both by murdering him and taking his name off everything, we may never have remembered Otto Roth in later times - but now we can say we can. A plaza, constructed in Timisoara under the order of Otto Roth's personal friend, our leader Petru Groza, has completed construction. Fitted with a plaque, grand statue, and beautiful flora, we can say he is adequately honored."
ban.107.a: "A great tribute to a great man."

ban.108.t: "Mátyás Rákosi Arrested"
ban.108.d: "Mátyás Rákosi, influential Totalist leader, has been apprehended! He has attempted to worm his way into power, and just now we are yanking him out of the hole he is digging to achieve such a goal. He shall be dealt with at once, and be given a trial that will not be in his favour at all."
ban.108.a: "And you will stay in prison!"

ban.109.t: "The Socialist Transition"
ban.109.d: "The Revolution has finally made its way into Banat! Now liberated and free, Banat is ready to make its final changes into a socialist nation. Already having done social reforms, establishing a commune system, among other smaller, less significant things, we are rooting out the last vestiges of capitalism from this country."
ban.109.a: "Unlock the dam locking our freedom away!"

ban.110.t: "The Search for the Destablilizers"
ban.110.d: "There have been a string of minor attacks around Banat, with the aim of destabilizing our grip on these lands. We've frankly had enough of these troublemakers, so it's time we send out the army in order to find and bring these vigilantes to justice. They won't stand a chance against a professional military!"
ban.110.a: "We'll find you!"

ban.111.t: "Destablilizers apprehended!"
ban.111.d: "After countless hours of toiling in order to find these dangerous rebels, we've come up with both full hands and a lack of recent attacks. We've approved their execution, due to their horrible crimes against our nation. Hopefully now we can see some kind of stability return to Banat."
ban.111.a: "To the court you go. And you won't make it back home."

ban.112.t: "Planning a Referendum"
ban.112.d: "It's time for us to finally attempt expansion, peacefully. We have decided that the best way to do this would be holding a referendum in the desired territories, which may or may not go through. Really, it's all just a gamble. If we do get this, however, our potential as a nation shall be greatly increased. As if we aren't already increasing our potential."
ban.112.a: "Let's send this offer."
ban.112.b: "Send the offer, but sweeten the deal."
ban.112.c: "Nevermind this."

ban.113.t: "Banat Demands a Referendum"
ban.113.d: "The Banat Republic, a breakaway of ours, has suggested that we hold a referendum. It's quite the daring move, but it may be able to get those pesky Transylvanians off our backs. They only want the states of Crisana and Transylvania, it seems. Of course, if the referendum fails, we will keep our land."
ban.113.a: "We can do that, who cares?"
ban.113.b: "Get out."

ban.114.t: "Banat Demands A Referendum with Alliance"
ban.114.d: "The Banat Republic, a breakaway of ours, has suggested that we hold a referendum, and that they will join us in an alliance. It's quite the daring move, but it could prove beneficial to regain them in the Austrian sphere of influence."
ban.114.a: "Let's send this to Austria."
ban.114.b: "Yeah, sure."
ban.114.c: "No."

ban.115.t: "Hungary Accepts"
ban.115.d: "The Hungarians have tossed their lands up for a gamble and accepted our proposal! The voting will begin soon, and it will only include people in those affected lands. Let's pray that we get these lands, in order to expand the goodwill of Otto Roth..."
ban.115.a: "Unexpected, but good."

ban.116.t: "Hungary Denies Referendum"
ban.116.d: "The Hungarians have retorted at us that they will never give any land to our country. They have called us weak, and told thus that we will never even get anywhere with our nation. That was excessively rude to us, of course. But we can't do anything."
ban.116.a: "We'll do something sometime."

ban.117.t: "Hungary Comes with News"
ban.117.d: "Hungary has come to us with a supposed referendum on Transylvanian lands being given to the Banat Republic, but there's a catch. They will become our ally in return for the exchange. With such an interesting proposal, it is the fact that they are technically rejoining us versus the fact that they can just be run over by our military. What do we say to this referendum?"
ban.117.a: "Well, we will technically regain land"
ban.117.a: "No, outrageous!"

ban.118.t: "Referendum succeeds!"
ban.118.d: "The Hungarians have placed their votes and now tallied them. Somehow, just somehow, the territories affected by the referendum want to join our nation! The Hungarians have accepted the results, and the agreed lands have been transferred to us.\nLet's welcome the new lands to Great Banat!"
ban.118.a: "Welcome, new lands!"

ban.119.t: "Referendum fails!"
ban.119.d: "The Hungarians have placed their votes and now tallied them. Somehow, just somehow, the territories affected by the referendum want to stay with Hungary! Shocking to the entire Banatian government, but perhaps the vote was rigged, although we have no proof. We can get more land later..."
ban.119.a: "That's too bad."

ban.120.t: "Rothian Thought"
ban.120.d: "Otto Roth, First President of the Banat Republic, has proven himself capable of leading the nation time and time again. His thought has influenced other social democrats from across the globe, in not many ways but it is still something. His kind attitude garners the support of his people, his professional manner, his code of conduct. A competent leader, it seems. If only we were more powerful."
ban.120.a: "A man of many talents."

ban.121.t: "Banat, the Harmonious"
ban.121.d: "The Balkans has always been known as a place of turmoil, where the Weltkrieg started, where the Ottomans waged war, where everyone there waged war. But there's one exception: us! We have been noted as not having ethnic conflicts and internal strife. This allows for a unified populace that can work together to fight, even if it means fighting the country to where their ethnicity originates from. They have accepted themselves as Banatians, not Serbs, nor Romanians, nor Hungarians. They are Banatians."
ban.121.a: "Indeed we are."

ban.122.t: "Women Celebrate"
ban.122.d: "The women of Banat have at this point noticed their elevating status, their equalization with the men. Although not there yet, the women are allowed to get jobs at a wider selection of sources, be appointed to higher positions, and a few other things, all of which they are ecstatic about. You can see a female pedestrian with a grin as she walks to her new job. The new laws have seen a rise in our economy too, as the women work hard jobs as well as easier, tedious ones."
ban.122.a: "Celebrate all you want!"

ban.123.t: "Albert Bartha's Words to Roth"
ban.123.d: "Albert Bartha called for a private meeting with Otto Roth, our President, on this day. To him he expressed his gratitude to Roth for his handling of the nation, how it was prospering under him, and how the people were happy to be ruled by the man. Albert Bartha blessed Roth with these words, along with a few more compliments to the topic. Soon, Bartha shook hands with Roth and departed, as Roth himself figured out his country, and obviously found himself seeing all the things Bartha had told him."
ban.123.a: "We are small yet ideal."

ban.124.t: "Attack in Liberty Square!"
ban.124.d: "Only a mere hour ago did the residents of Timisoara shake to the sound of an explosion. An explosion in Liberty Square, to be exact. As the police arrived, the criminal was busy murdering and executing helpless civilians. When the police did arrive, the masked man fled, and the gunshots faded. As of this time, the death toll stands at 19, a huge number for such a terrorist attack. The people grieve for those lost, and the people shout at the law enforcement for their failure."
ban.124.a: "This is not what a Banatian would do!"

ban.125.t: "Perpetrator Arrested"
ban.125.d: "While on duty today, a cop noticed a familiar figure. Black clothes, face shied away from him, and a hastier gait, the policeman grabbed this unknown figure, and stared into his eyes. In those eyes were the pupils of destruction, hate, and death. He struggled, but was knocked unconscious. He awaits his execution now, as there was no time to give such a horrible man a fitting punishment. He is considered mentally insane, so it was just thought that it would be more humane to put the man out of his misery, and give him justice."
ban.125.a: "He is insane..."

ban.126.t: "Robbery thwarted" 
ban.126.d: "A couple hours ago, the Timisoara Museum was attacked by a masked man, who subdued three civilians before being neutralized by the on-duty security guard. The police declared no deaths, simply incapacitations, and the only casualty was that of the robber. The police have requested the firearm to be added to the museum's collection, in a special case. The people too are proud of their nation for such a disarmament."
ban.126.a: "and that IS what Banatians do!"

ban.127.t: "The Friendliest Face"
ban.127.d: "Banat, under Otto Roth, appears to be as kind as it gets. It is not that way - we are willing to fight! We can pick a fight, and come out victorious! No, not a one on one with Albania - a one on one with Serbia or Romania. Whatever it is, we will stand up for what is right, all the while the world believes that the enemy is in the wrong simply because of our facade."
ban.127.a: "Even if we are kind, we are ferocious."

ban.128.t: "The Spirit of the Banatian"
ban.128.d: "A reaper looms over our nation in the form of a ghastly war. It will bring death and destruction, and we are willing to both cause it and endure it if it means the victory or unchanged position of Banat. The spirit of our nation is like no other. We are ready to fight! We will go on to the end. Every Banatian is willing to die for the nation.\nWe'll see them on the battlefield soon enough."
ban.128.a: "Rise, Banat! To the fight!"

ban.129.t: "Banat at Rest"
ban.129.d: "The war that once loomed like a reaper over our nation is gone. We still stand alive, strong, and proud. But we have lost one important thing - our will to fight as hard as we did. Perhaps in the next war it will return, and that will happen as long as the patriotic Banatian continues to believe in his nation, which should continue for all eternity.\nEternal glory and life to the Banat Republic!"
ban.129.a: "It is a day of mourning for those lost."

ban.130.t: "Codreanu Gives up Cache Location"
ban.130.d: "Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, former Conducator of the Romanian Legionary State, under intense pressure, has given up the location of a large weapons arsenal hidden in the Carpathian Mountains. We of course have sent him off to prison now, and as for the cache, a brigade was ordered to make its way to the arsenal in case of any unlikely resistance. Motorized equipment is being sent as far as possible, due to the unknown location of the cache. Codreanu was also generous enough to provide an exact guide and key to the vault door."
ban.130.a: "Treasure hunt?"

ban.131.t: "Cache Found!"
ban.131.d: "Following the guide Codreanu presented, the brigade discovered an obscure hole in the side of a mountain, leading to a door. Using the key also provided, inside was a large pile of infantry weaponry, enough to supply a small guerilla army. We've sent vehicles to go pick up the weapons, and return them to the national arsenal, where we will give them over to our soldiers."
ban.131.a: "Oh, wow."

ban.132.t: "Romanian Generals Defect"
ban.132.d: "We've made headway! Three Romanian generals have returned to our rule, and have surrendered. They have already pledged allegiance to the King, and we in turn have given them amnesty and re-appointed them to positions of power within the army.\nNeedless to say, this will surely assist the Banatian military in its great conquests!"
ban.132.a: "They have realized the error of their ways."

ban.133.t: "Signing of the new Constitution"
ban.133.d: "Carol II has approved the signing of a new Constitution, which is allegedly supposed to provide freedom, liberty, and equality to the people, but it is unsure for just how much of that is true, as no reporter has got their hands on a copy of the Constitution.\nAs for the people who can do that, it was unanimously agreed upon, and has taken effect. The Kingdom now has a formal constitution, catered to Romania rather than Banat."
ban.133.a: "Fair, as it should be."

ban.134.t: "Carol II Appointed Field Marshal"
ban.134.d: "Carol II, our glorious King, has appointed himself as a field marshal of the army. He states that his reason is so he can personally see the fall of enemy armies. Nobody knows how competent he really is as a military commander, but it is hoped that he will at least be able to hold the country in case of a foreign invasion..."
ban.134.a: "His fighting spirit is extraordinary."

ban.135.t: "Disgruntled Soldier Opens Fire on Carol!"
ban.135.d: "A mere four hours ago, Carol II was in the midst of a public appearance for his people. While his crowd eagerly cheered and hailed him, there was an exception to that crowd. A man in a concealed trench coat, hidden face, suspicious gait. The suspect slunk around Carol's entourage, making his way behind, to which he lifted his face to appear more casual. The suspect blinked. Without much hesitation, the man ran forward as fast as his legs could carry him, and whipped out a pistol in the act. His finger closed around the trigger, as Carol turned around in what seemed to be an eternity.\nBANG! BANG! BANG! A multitude of gunshots rang throughout the Bucharest streets. The gun's smoke cleared as fast as the screams fled into the distance, and on the ground lay a body. The gunman convulsed, twitching in vile pain. Carol himself was dragged away, ushered away by his bodyguards, while his shocked eyes watched the gunman bleed out in a bloody mess. As soon as those three gunshots had reached the press, which was at the speed of sound, articles were put out all over Romania within the hour, headlines reading "Attempted Assassination on King Carol!" and similar titles, describing the event rather vaguely, falsely claiming that the gunman pulled the trigger and missed. In fact, the gunman had no chance to fire his weapon. Had he, there would have been no missing.\nCarol, however, has been shaken by the incident, but his resolve only hardened and his hatred against the Iron Guard intensified."
ban.135.a: "Thank God."

ban.136.t: "Romania Wishes for our Territory"
ban.136.d: "The Romanians have been plotting. Plotting behind us, to our flanks, anywhere where we cannot see. But we have caught them red-handed! As with their predecessor, the Iron Guard, Carol II's regime from Bucharest desires Transylvania. Not just that, but Alfold, and perhaps even Transcarpathia!\nWe must prepare for a defensive campaign against the belligerent Romania."
ban.136.a: "Come and take it then, Banatian!"

ban.137.t: "Use of the Military"
ban.137.d: "The military has proven itself loyal to the cause of Albert Bartha and his stratocratic regime. Power is motivating, after all, but not to Bartha. The only real reason why he would ever need an expansion in power is if unscrupulous dolts decide to oppose his plans and actions. Only then will he need to take direct control, which will come right from Timisoara. But dealing with opposition forces, such as rebellious citizens, is also a fine move - one which only the most stupid of politicians could try to not do."
ban.137.a: "Use it to deal with all opposition forces."
ban.137.b: "Use it to personally elevate Albert Bartha."

ban.138.t: "Unrest Plagues the Streets"
ban.138.d: "As our situation spirals further down the drain every day, the people are taking notice. Protests line the streets, and even have begun blocking vehicles. From each avenue to alleyway, people crowd, musing about how horrible our government is. Of course, they are very incorrect! But there is just too much."
ban.138.a: "Unrest here is like locusts in Egypt."

ban.139.t: "Efforts Fruitless"
ban.139.d: "The efforts strategized by police and generals alike is, surprisingly, having little effect on the population's angry attitude. The situation is getting worse with each passing day, so reforms are a must. As Conducator, Albert Bartha really must do things soon, if he is to save Banat from total ruin."
ban.139.a: "Despicable."

ban.140.t: "End the Draft?"
ban.140.d: "After the introduction of a great draft, many citizens have actively dodged the draft and taken to the streets to protest the radical change of course. Of course, now that much of the troubles are over, and the unruly riled citizenry dealt with, it is time to either reduce or outright end the draft."
ban.140.a: "It is causing us more harm than help."
ban.140.b: "Reduce it. We won't can it."

ban.141.t: "Draft Change Comes Into Effect"
ban.141.d: "The proposed change to the extreme draft has started actually working. The reduction of conscription has relieved many, and kept others bitter. No matter how many times we tell them it is for the greater good of Banat, they will not listen. When will they learn?\nThis draft change should at least quell some of the new protests. Not many like to be drafted, so it was only necessary that we reduce the draft. Some may still get conscripted, but this should work for both the government and the people."
ban.141.a: "This should do it!"
ban.141.b: "Let's hope it's enough..."

ban.142.t: "The Riots Calm Down"
ban.142.d: "After many days of intense criticism of the government, the turmoil is over! The army and police together were able to calm down the people, angry at the government for failing to contain the peace after the death of Otto Roth. We've finally done enough to satisfy these angry citizens, the ones wanting Roth's government back.\nWith this advancement, surely now progress can be made towards a better Banat..."
ban.142.a: "That was too close."

ban.143.t: "Reinvigorated Military"
ban.143.d: "The small military is battered from all the internal strife, but now they have seen hope and glory! It's time to strike on them! We're planning a mass arrest on the next big protests, and scare all the rest off. It is a requirement for the greater good later on, which has to be obtained through these controversial methods.\nBut for now, the military has their heads high up for the first time in weeks, their talk is commonplace, and you can generally just see improvement. Let's hope to see victory!"
ban.143.a: "Let's try now!"

ban.144.t: "Effects of the Attempt"
ban.144.d: "The military has regained a lot of its morale, so they thought it was only necessary to try and quell the riots. As military units marched into the streets, they were met with fierce protest resistance. No rounds were fired. The military was successful in making many arrests, although not enough.\nIt remains to be seen what happens now, but it appears that riots are somewhat calming down, according to both police and on-duty soldiers."
ban.144.a: "Good enough."

ban.145.t: "Bartha Makes a Speech"
ban.145.d: "Albert Bartha, famed leader of the Banat, is giving a speech. In it he is detailing the state of the nation truthfully, and how it is prospering. The public met his appearance with jeering, but after the speech started they quieted, as he detailed his saving of Banat, despite the protests that have struck Banat over and over. There is truth to this speech as well, as stability is slowly returning to our country, no matter how slow."
ban.145.a: "Good speech."

ban.146.t: "Secret Police Provides Intelligence"
ban.146.d: "The secret police, used to locate inside threats, have targeted the Iron Guard for some time now. At last their efforts have bore fruit, as they uncovered a plot to commit atrocities on our soil. Of course, that will never happen now that we know that they will be attacking us. A strike plan has been drawn, and a police unit is being organized and disciplined to fight this small battle."
ban.146.a: "Let's get these vigilantes."

ban.147.t: "Military Parade"
ban.147.d: "A uniform military parade was conducted today, with the might of our military displayed across the nation. It is a necessary defense against both outside and inside threats. Each soldier marched flawlessly, with perfect movement and discipline. Guns hoisted upwards, deafening marching, and clinking gears. The next one should be even better than this one!"
ban.147.a: "Delightful!"

ban.148.t: "Reinstate the Draft?"
ban.148.d: "The Great Draft, as it has been called, was reduced recently, but we have found our nation on the battlefield again. Thus a debate has opened inside the government, on whether to re-implement the old draft. While unpopular due to the high conscription, it is necessary for the defense of Banat.\nAnd once they had considered every last detail, they said to the law:"
ban.148.a: "Rise again!"
ban.148.b: "Of course."
ban.148.c: "We do not need to."

ban.149.t: "Hungary is Ours"
ban.149.d: "The red banner flies over Budapest at last! However, it is jeered by the passersby. While we officially control all of the lands of the former Hungary, their people have not accepted the rule of our nation yet. In time they too will see the benefits of cooperation.\nAs for now, we should continue the suppression of uprisings across our new territory."
ban.149.a: "Our rule shall be benevolent."

ban.150.t: "Hungary is Truly Ours"
ban.150.d: "After a tumultuous few weeks of Hungarian incursions that cropped up across the country, it is with great excitement that we report that these uprisings have all been eliminated! The Hungarian people bow to our benevolent rule, their true overlords. The red banner flies in Budapest unopposed, tall and proud, a true sign that the days of the old Hungary is no more."
ban.150.a: "Thank you for listening."

ban.151.t: "Restocking the Military"
ban.151.d: "The economic rehabilitation plan is... going all according to plan. This phase of the plan involves the construction of military production facilities in order to restock our war machine and improve the current equipment of the army. This is the second to last phase of the plan, and with a few more reforms and given a couple more months, we could see an economy relatively worthy to the country's potential.\nSurely we will be out of this economic grave soon!"
ban.151.a: "Great!"

ban.152.t: "Strike on the Disturbed"
ban.152.d: "The widespread socialist riots and demonstrations have ended today!\nA large protest in Timisoara was quelled peacefully, even as an explosion broke police lines. The explosion killed nobody, and the line was reformed, and slowly the protest was beaten back until they dispersed on their own. The army is also having similar success quelling small demonstrations and even armed vigilantes.\nNeedless to say, we've begun the path to restore stability to Banat."
ban.152.a: "There is stability now."

ban.153.t: "Socialist Violence!"
ban.153.d: "The minor socialist insurrections and riots have spread further through Banat, and now what were peaceful protests are truly no more, as every last protest ends up with an injury or death. Our police are overwhelmed, and the army cannot do much either against the masses of protesters walling Timisoara.\nToday, it only got worse than that. A large protest in Timisoara, with rocks flying from every direction, red banners waving, and deafening yelling, was interrupted by an explosion on the police lines. The shockwave sent many to heaven and many more in every direction. The yelling only intensified, and as the protestors charged forward, a word from the police was shouted with louder volume than the screeching of the protestors:"
ban.153.a: "Shoot!"

ban.154.t: "Corneliu Zelea Codreanu Arrested"
ban.154.d: "Famed Romanian Legionary, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, has been found at last! Found hidden in a house during a raid, he attempted to deny his identity, but was given away by his colleagues. Now he appears in front of the Banatian courts, sentenced to endless prison.\nJustice has been served at last to the man who destroyed Romania!"
ban.154.a: "You will never escape us."
ban.154.b: "Execute him."

ban.155.t: "Joint Invasion with Banat?"
ban.155.d: "Our similar-minded friends in the Banat have proposed quite the interesting plan. It is a coded attack on Transylvania, with their forces moving northwards to cut off Hungary. The Banatians have repeatedly affirmed that they can indeed hold their line, but shall they fall, we will too. Hungary is very unlikely to accept a white peace, they will be out for blood on the chance we enact this plan. Shall we do it, or shall we not do it?"
ban.155.a: "Let's do this."
ban.155.b: "It's too risky."

ban.156.t: "The Red Menace"
ban.156.d: "The Red Menace in Banat has been ravaging the Balkans for far too long. Now that we too are under that attack, others have definitely noticed their aggressive warmongering in the name of the Revolution. It is time to form a coalition, a Balkan coalition.\n\nThere shall be no compromises... it is total surrender for either side."
ban.156.a: "We have to, to protect the Balkans!"

ban.157.t: "Banat Wishes to Join the Sphere"
ban.157.d: "Having split from Hungary in the wake of the Hungarian-Romanian War, the Banat has formally extended both a treaty of friendship and furthermore an offer of alliance, with us being the head of said alliance. Technically, they are rejoining us, but some are unhappy with this, citing that they abandoned us first, and that we should decline and re-annex them. But after hours of fierce debate, there was a settlement:"
ban.157.a: "They are rejoining us."
ban.157.b: "Nope."

ban.158.t: "Banat Seeks Protection"
ban.158.d: "As our sphere of influence grows, an unlikely candidate has reached out with hopes of joining that sphere: Banat. Banat has expressed quite clearly their intentions to join our alliance, and to cooperate with our interests. However, many people dealing in this affair do not care for their joining, citing how small and insignificant it is, no matter how bad that is of an opinion. And we told the Banat Republic this:"
ban.158.a: "We have to, to protect the Balkans!"
ban.158.b: "You keep out, socialist."

ban.160.t: "[BAN.GetName] in the Belgrade Pact?"
ban.160.d: "The old Iron Guard in Romania has been extinguished by none other than the old Romania, centered in Banat. Their government has ambitions much like the Iron Guard - to gather the lands needed for realizing the dream of Greater Romania.\nTheir army is large enough to oppose an enemy nation like Bulgaria, competent enough to stand up to that enemy, and overall just ready enough to fight an opposing nation. This begs the question:\n\nShould we let [BAN.GetNameDef] into the Belgrade Pact?"
ban.160.a: "Better than we expected."
ban.160.b: "We had other plans."

ban.161.t: "Austria Subjugated"
ban.161.d: "The old Austrian regime lies in bonds. We hold it and its future, along with the future of all of the former lands of Austria. The ideas of the Revolution are to be spread around the world, everywhere.\nAnd so the future for Austria was set. We have declared a Union, a Union of the Danube. United by the river, and by the spirit of all workers, we press forward. Nationalism will be eradicated from their land. Ethnic boundaries will no longer exist in our Danubian Union. We are all Danubians."
ban.161.a: "Let us make this... official."

ban.162.t: "Order Slipping from Transylvania"
ban.162.d: "Our new government is in disarray. Slovakia has declared open rebellion against our administration, and every day where our armies are not the people get more restless. Restlessness that culminates in violence, infighting, and unruly freedom. All over Hungary, besides Banat, is in this state.\nThis is especially noticeable in Transylvania, where the Carpathian Mountains shelter angry terrorist organizations. They have pounced on our weakness and have begun to coerce the weakened minds of the population into joining their flawed cause. Meanwhile, police forces are going rogue and the cities have no more laws. It is essentially anarchy, and that is not what any of them want either. They wish for freedom, and they want it badly. That freedom will most likely come sooner or later, and we'll be the ones fighting against it..."
ban.162.a: "We're in danger."

ban.163.t: "Transylvania Unifies!"
ban.163.d: "And it has happened. Transylvania is now in an official revolution. And unluckily for us, there is no infighting within the newly-proclaimed "Transylvania". They are one and together, against our government. They are being recruited en masse, and being unscrupulous militants who raid armories. We are alone.\nBut we will fight the good fight. We will defeat these rebels. Once we take their dirty hands off our Transylvania, their hands will be removed, and their heads on pikes sitting on the mountains. And if they do manage to come out alive, somehow, then we have failed in our duties.\nBut we must not focus on what we will do to them then - we must think about what we will do to them now, in order to ensure that they will never attempt to oppose our regime ever again."
ban.163.a: "Onwards!"

ban.164.t: "Transdanubia in Flames!"
ban.164.d: "The situation is not aging kindly. The Transdanubia area has been burning with unrest ever since the arrival of Rakosi's government into Hungary. Today, those tensions exploded. Buildings are burning and fourteen small militias are on the hunt for us Totalists. Eager and encouraged to wipe our government out, they march towards Budapest. They have also claimed a never surrender policy, and that we may only beat them once every last bit of them is stamped out. Thus we will do exactly that, and dump them all in a disrespectful grave.\n This tallies our revolt counter higher, and furthermore the need to suppress and exterminate. In only a matter of a month or two from now, our boots will be marching through streets with their blood smeared all over. We'll show yet more traitors who's boss."
ban.164.a: "Stop resisting!"

ban.165.t: "Transylvania Holds Strong"
ban.165.d: "It has been a grueling slog attempting to fight the Transylvanians, but it has been proven that they are too strong. Matyas Rakosi has met with leaders of the Transylvanian revolt, and negotiated terms of surrender, which include recognizing Transylvania as an independent nation.\nThis is a day too dark even for us..."
ban.165.a: "How?! We'll get you!"

ban.166.t: "The war is lost!"
ban.166.d: "The war is not necessarily advancing with Hungary's interests. The enemy holds Budapest. However, it is entirely possible that we give up as much land as possible to our unconquered allies, in the attempt to save the country from occupation from the Totalist scum. We have proposed ceding land to Slovakia in the north, Galicia in the north, and Austria in the west, in order to save as much land as possible. However, again, we are surrendering, and if we keep up this war any longer we will surely lose."
ban.166.a: "We give up, but cede as much land as possible!"
ban.166.b: "Fight... on..."

ban.167.t: "The war is lost!"
ban.167.d: "The war is not necessarily advancing with Hungary's interests. The enemy holds Budapest. However, it is entirely possible that we give up as much land as possible to our unconquered allies, in the attempt to save the country from occupation from the Totalist scum. We have proposed ceding land to Slovakia, releasing it as part of the Austrian Empire in the north, Galicia in the north, and Austria in the west, in order to save as much land as possible. However, again, we are surrendering, and if we keep up this war any longer we will surely lose."
ban.167.a: "We give up, but establish Slovakia and cede land!"
ban.167.b: "Fight... on..."

ban.168.t: "The war is lost!"
ban.168.d: "The war is not necessarily advancing with Hungary's interests. The enemy holds Budapest. However, it is entirely possible that we give up as much land as possible to our unconquered allies, in the attempt to save the country from occupation from the Totalist scum. We have no choice but to offer unconditional surrender, or continue on this pointless war. The enemy holds Budapest, they hold Slovakia, they hold everywhere of interest. There is not much we can do, fighting more will only mean more harm to the Hungarian people. Hopefully they can take up the fight..."
ban.168.a: "Cede land to Austria!"
ban.168.b: "Fight... on..."

ban.169.t: "Hungary surrenders!"
ban.169.d: "The Hungarian nation is overwhelmed by our forces, and while they have been forced into submission, they have ceded as much land as possible to neighbors such as Austria, Galicia, and Slovakia. There isn't much we can do about this, as the peace treaty details a peace with Hungary as well."
ban.169.a: "They'll fall too."

ban.170.t: "Hungary surrenders!"
ban.170.d: "The Hungarian nation is overwhelmed by our forces, and while they have been forced into submission, they have ceded as much land as possible to Austria, specifically German West Hungary. There isn't much we can do about this, as the peace treaty details a peace with Hungary as well."
ban.170.a: "We shall take that later."

ban.500.t: "Invitation to the Harmony Accord"
ban.500.d: "The Banat Republic has invited us to their faction of mutual cooperation, the Harmony Accord. It is made up of anything and everything. Shall we join?"
ban.500.a: "Sure, why not?"
ban.500.b: "Stupid idea."

hun.1.t: "Maneuvers in the Carpathians"
hun.1.d: "The Romanian Army has been spotted seemingly exercising along the range of the Carpathian Mountains, or worse, preparing. There is now a significant military buildup on our side, and we are ready to fight... if we are even to fight. It is evident that the Romanians have seen us too, as there are standing guards along the mountains.\nWhatever is supposed to be happening down in the Legionary state, we don't know, but a preemptive strike could bring them down."
hun.1.a: "Leave them alone."
hun.1.b: "Shoot them."

hun.2.t: "Romania returns fire!"
hun.2.d: "After our shots rang out, the Romanians ducked behind cover. A few minutes later, no white flag was seen waving over the border, but instead gun barrels. The border is in a state of war! What shall we do?"
hun.2.a: "Stand down! Stand down!"
hun.2.b: "This is war!"

hun.3.t: "Peace with Hungary?"
hun.3.d: "This war has been raging for months now and there is no arguable victor. Many are now arguing for peace with the Austro-Hungarian forces and several in the high command agree. Of course, this would not be popular with revanchist elements within society, but even they agree that we need more time to regroup and rebuild so we can liberate our brothers in Transylvania. "
hun.3.b: "Keep the War going!"
hun.3.a: "We have gained nothing, time for Peace"

bannews.1.t: "The Return of the Romanian Monarchy"
bannews.1.d: "After years of exile and nonexistence, the remaining Monarchists of Romania have managed a coup of the newly-founded Banat Republic. King Carol II has already been crowned King of the Kingdom of Romania, or as others say, the Kingdom of Romania in Exile. The Iron Guard in Romania eyes the situation nervously, as this development is a major threat - but more worrisome is the fact that some neighboring nations have already recognized its independence. The Romanian Monarchy in Banat has begun a militarization, arming, and reorganizing process to ready the country for its struggle against the Iron Guard. The remaining Monarchists inside the Iron Guard have began terrorist and warlike attacks on the Iron Guard's military and people, causing criticism - but the Kingdom claims no affiliation. This could easily be a large power shift in the Balkans..."
bannews.1.a: "War is soon to come again, isn't it?"

bannews.2.t: "Proclamation of Greater Romania"
bannews.2.d: "After exile and return, King Carol II of Romania has found Romania as a strong nation yet again. Having taken back Romania first, then the entirety of Transylvania and eastern national Hungary, and the claimed Dobrudja region, the Romanian Parliament met today to unanimously decree that the nation of Romania to be from then on referred to as "Greater Romania".\nHaving amassed a large amount of territory to control and subdue, many figures have already mused that this Greater Romania will not last for long, and will fall to the fate of inner conflict."
bannews.2.a: "Good job, I guess."
bannews.2.b: "A joyous and opportune time for celebration!"

bannews.3.t: "The Four Squares' Riots"
bannews.3.d: "The Banat is once again in crisis. The new Iron Guard government has encountered fierce resistance from the population upon the execution of their beloved leader, Otto Roth. Unrest has spiked all across the nation, and a part of that is violent. This violence is especially prevalent in Timisoara, where riots have erupted and massed in the four squares of Timisoara. The Four Squares' Riots has become extreme, with police shooting down unarmed protestors, rocks being pelted at police, and amassing of military ordnance in secluded areas. Word is mounting that the military is preparing to cull the protest through violent means, as the protests have only worsened. Horia Sima, currently leader of Banat, has denounced the protests and issued threats and warnings to the population."
bannews.3.a: "Banat is on a knife's edge..."
bannews.3.b: "Clamp down on the media!"

bannews.4.t: "Banat Goes Dark"
bannews.4.d: "An unknown amount of time ago the world stopped receiving transmissions and messages from the Banat region. Although only hours have passed since this event, anyone trying to find their way into the Banat in order to find out what went wrong has turned up either no answers or a harrowing tale of nearly being killed. Or, not returning at all. \nA volunteer expedition into the area yielded zero results at all, and only half the party returned. When inquired on that other half's whereabouts, the party unanimously claimed that they had split, and heard quiet gunshots some twenty minutes later.\nWhatever is going on in this situation, only the Banatians know...\nAny radio stations tuned to previous Banatian channels yield only propaganda for the Totalist cause, and strange talk about Hungary."
bannews.4.a: "Just what is really going on in Timisoara?"
bannews.4.b: "They know nothing. Neither will they ever know."
