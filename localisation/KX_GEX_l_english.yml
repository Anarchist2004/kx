GER_rebuilding_desc: "With the devastation of both the fall, invasion and reclamation of the Kaiserreich, our home is in ruins, every village has felt the scalding touch of artillery, bombs and more.

GER_swords_into_plowshares_desc: "The German people are tired of blood, two wars and the reclamation have made sure of that.

And through the works of our hands we will have created a magnificent fleet to surpass the old."

GEX.12.d: "The German government has collapsed and fled to Africa, assuming control over their former colonies here.

Should we demand that they turn over the territories, on threat of continuing the war, or end it now?"

GEX.12.b: "We have had enough of war with the Germans."

GEX.13.t: "The [NFA.GetAdjective] Threat"

GEX.101.t: "The Liberation of the Reich"
GEX.101.d: "Few expected our defeat in the Second Weltkrieg and our subsequent banishment from Europe. Even fewer expected our return. With the help of our auxiliary territories around the world, we have mustered the strength to reclaim our homeland from the traitors and invaders that forced us out not too long ago. Massive celebrations have erupted throughout all of Germany, and our Kaiser held a speech in front of jubilous crowds of the Brandenburg Gate. While damaged extensively, restoration has already began to repair the monument. Yet, behind all of the celebration and carousing, roundups of the supporters of the collaboration government have begun already, as we ensure that we are never put in a position of exile ever again."
GEX.101.a: "We Finally Return"
GEX.101.b: "Three Cheers for Germany!"

GEX.102.t: "The state of the Kaiserliche Marine"
GEX.102.d1: "After our return to the Kaiserreich, many openly wondered how we would go about dealing with the loss of the Kaiserliche marine, while undoubtedly it would be inevitable that a great effort would be made to restore it's former might, the administration has been torn between two plans, a moderate proposal to intensify manufacturing to quickly build a workable fleet, or a much more ambitious proposal, dubbed "Plan Z" to rapidly build up the fleet to it's former strength within just a few years, a decision must be made."
GEX.102.d2: "After our return to the Kaiserreich, many openly wondered how we would go about dealing with the loss of the Kaiserliche marine, while undoubtedly it would be inevitable that a great effort would be made to restore it's former might, the administration has been torn between two plans, a moderate proposal to intensify manufacturing to quickly build a workable fleet, or an alternative proposal that emphasized more the merchant marine, to bolster trade and thus simultaneously the economy of Germany, a decision must be made."
GEX.102.a: "Go with the Moderate proposal"
GEX.102.b: "Initiate Plan Z!"
GEX.102.c: "Let us focus on the merchant Marine"

GEXAOG.101.t: "Chaos in outer Manchuria!"
GEXAOG.101.d: "Though the border of Manchuria with the German administration of China has always been tense, not least since the German exiles landed in the region, the past few days has been seeming radio silence on the matter, perplexingly not a single report from the garrison about German interference or even presence had been made. It was not until today that a message arrived from an inspection sent by the local administration relayed reports that militants had cut off communications and had almost managed to seize the Amur Basin for themselves. However that was not the end of it, shortly thereafter, reports from Chinese newspapers announced that German troops intended to "restore order" in the region, while it is definitely possible to reach the region first given our superior familiarity with logisitics in the region, and it would definitely be a great loss to relinquish the region to their control, many of our general staff fear such an intervention would bring us to open warfare with the war hardened German Exiles."
GEXAOG.101.a: "Unacceptable, send in troops at once!"
GEXAOG.101.b: "Pull out any remaining garrisons, its not worth the blood"

GEXAOG.102.t: "The [FROM.GetNameDef] repel our encroachment"
GEXAOG.102.d: "Despite our attempt to seize the lands of Outer Manchuria quietly, the [FROM.GetNameDef] threatens to thwart us, with reports coming in of rapid military mobilization, soon to fall upon the region, if we are to seize our gains now, we shall have to do so by the sword."
GEXAOG.102.a: "We were this close"

GEXAOG.103.t: "We have seized Outer Manchuria"
GEXAOG.103.d: "It seems our scheme has been a runaway success, following the chaos spreading through the Amur Basin, our troops capitalizing on the inaction of the russian administration swooped in to restore order to the tumultuous region, clearing out "Brigands and rebels", and handing over the entirety of Outer Manchuria to us de facto without a single a gun fired."
GEXAOG.103.a: "Wonderful"

GEXAOG.104.t: "The German exiles sieze the ports!"
GEXAOG.104.d: "Today, chaos spread throughout the concessions as a sudden wave of unrest seized our territory, with riots flooding the streets of Shanghai, the German exile government, citing this, has sent in troops to "restore order" in the concessions, claiming that authority and order in the concessions has collapsed through our failure, though many openly suspect them to be responsible for agitating the sudden chaos, using the opportunity as a power play to seize the concessions."
GEXAOG.104.a: "We have no choice"
GEXAOG.104.b: "Expel their garrison, we won't hand over the ports so easily!"

GEXAOG.105.t: "The League expels our garrison!"
GEXAOG.105.d: "Despite our attempt to seize the concessions without bloodshed, it seems that against the odds, the Legationary council has kept course and expelled our troops."
GEXAOG.105.a: "We have been denied our prize!"

GEXAOG.106.t: "The League concedes authority"
GEXAOG.106.d: "After the chaos that gripped Shanghai and several other concessions, it seems that the legationary council has wisely decided not to object to our intervention into the ports, giving us valuable control over the rich assets and impressive dockyards that they offer."
GEXAOG.106.a: "Wonderful work."

GEXTXS.1.t: "Pro German Monarchist Sentiment"
GEXTXS.1.d: "Germany has Fallen, the German Sphere has collapsed and now tehir hated foes rule the European Continent. But against the Socialistic hordes, Texas holds out as one of the last beacons of responsible government in the world. Seeing that, the Kaiser of the German Empire has fled to Texas to seek refuge against the Invaders\n\n Along with a large pool of other advisers, exiles, and generals, they pledge to hold out against all whom would destroy their homeland and what it stands for in perpetuity. Their noble cause has caught the attention of the large community of Germans in Texas, who are loyal to the Kaiser and even support the peculiar idea of the government proclaiming him the Kaiser of Texas"
GEXTXS.1.a: "Hold him as an exile"
GEXTXS.1.b: "Proclaim him as Kaiser of Texas!"

GEXTXS.2.t: "A flag for the American Kaiserreich"
GEXTXS.2.d: "Despite our initial use of the new flag of the Amerikaniches Kaiserreich, it seems some in our administraiton fear it's overly "German" motif will not endear itself with our new American Citizens, and ahve come up with some alternative proposals for flags."
GEXTXS.2.a: "Stick with the Tricolor and Eagle"
GEXTXS.2.b: "The Star and Eagle flag is ideal"
GEXTXS.2.c: "Go with the Star and Tricolor design"

GEX_foreign.1.t: "Overtures from the German Exile Government"
GEX_foreign.1.d: "Today a messenger from the German Exile government has arrived, offering us a place in their renewed alliance, citing old ties, while they could make useful allies once more, one must consider that being dragged once more into a war already lost may not be wise."
GEX_foreign.1.a: "Together we are stronger!."
GEX_foreign.1.b: "They have already lost, let us not be dragged down with them."

GEX_foreign.2.t: "The [FROM.GetNameDef] have returned to the fold"
GEX_foreign.2.d: "Appealing to our preexisting ties, it seems that the [FROM.GetNameDef] have accepted our offer of renewed alliance and are ready to do their part in the liberation of Germany."
GEX_foreign.2.a: "Splendid."

GEX_foreign.3.t: "The [FROM.GetNameDef] have spurned us"
GEX_foreign.3.d: "Despite our old ties, it seems the [FROM.GetNameDef] have turned away any diplomatic overtures for a renewed alliance, perhaps either not wanting to get involved in far away wars or not recognizing our government as legitimate"
GEX_foreign.3.a: "Unfortunate."

GEX_foreign.4.t: "The Germans threaten us!"
GEX_foreign.4.d: "Do we become puppets?."
GEX_foreign.4.a: "Are they that eager to die again?."
GEX_foreign.4.b: "I always liked RP games more anyway."

GEX_foreign.5.t: "The [FROM.GetNameDef] have rejected our demands"
GEX_foreign.5.d: "YES!."
GEX_foreign.5.a: "KILL!."

GEX_foreign.6.t: "The [FROM.GetNameDef] have Accepted"
GEX_foreign.6.d: "Wisely, the [FROM.GetNameDef] have acquiesced to our demands in full. This is a great relief, as there is no need to spill German blood or waste German iron on this day. A peaceful resolution has been negotiated between our government and theirs, and light celebrations have flickered throughout our lands. While this victory is a far cry from what we hope to achieve, let us rejoice that there is still cause to celebrate."
GEX_foreign.6.a: "Another step closer to Berlin."

GEX_foreign.7.t: "The Germans Mobilize!"
GEX_foreign.7.d: "Ever since the Germans were banished to [FROM.GetNameDef], we have anticipated the day where we fight the weakened, yet formidable German presence on our border. We have received reports that the German exile government in [FROM.GetNameDef] has mobilized against our border and skirmishes have already erupted in neighboring towns. While the German government is weakened, there is no doubt that they are still capable; we will need a miracle to survive against the Hun."
GEX_foreign.7.a: "Each and every man under my command owes me one hundred German scalps... And I want my scalps!"

GEX_foreign.8.t: "The German Government in Exile request protection"
GEX_foreign.8.d: "We have received an offer from the German government in exile, offering to establish trade and economic ties with us in exchange for assurance we will come to their aid should they come under attack.
GEX_foreign.8.a: "We accept."
GEX_foreign.8.b: "We don't need them."

GEX_foreign_east.1.t: "The Fallen East"
GEX_foreign_east.1.d: "Our glorious fatherland has fallen, the emotional blow still striking our government even after we narrowly escaped and brought whatever assets we could. However it seems god himself isn’t relenting the fury brought upon our increasingly apathetic leadership, News has arrived from the east of vultures bearing down on our possessions. Even as we thought our far off possessions safe from the much larger stakes in Europe, it appears that the opportunists of the Japanese, guerrilla groups and even other colonial regimes have taken our fall as a firesale in the east. Now we must decide what to do with this recent turning point.\nSome in our government, most particularly the apathetic ones are saying that we should just give up the east, as it’s already lost and any attempt to regain it draws resources away from our reclamation of the fatherland. However some remain adamant that we should intervene in the east, both to save the assets we have as well as an act of defiance to our recently grim fate. We have been trampled on before, but this will continue no further."
GEX_foreign_east.1.a: "It's a lost cause."
GEX_foreign_east.1.b: "We will not accept this humiliation, to war!."

GEX_foreign_east.2.t: "The Germans extend an olive branch"
GEX_foreign_east.2.d: "The Germans have sent us a telegram, after their loss in mainland Europe that exiled them to Africa, they are unwilling to fight and so offer us a deal. They will give us their eastern lands in exchange we let them move all their assets and troops out. While this does seem to be a good deal, it will both allow the Germans all their eastern military units to rejoin with their government and their future schemes, as well as take up the ever more scarce prospect, Time. So shall we let them leave peacefully within the year, or shall we take up arms in a swift conquest that will leave the Germans without their precious troops and gain us legitimacy in the eyes of potential Asian allies."
GEX_foreign_east.2.a: "We have triumphed"
GEX_foreign_east.2.b: "No Negotiations with Imperialists!"

GEX_foreign_east.3.t: "The Japanese accept our withdrawal"
GEX_foreign_east.3.d: "The Japanese have responded to our offer with acceptance, Allowing us to exit the east in peace which means we can conserve our strength in the wider fight to reclaim the homeland. Only thing now is that we have yet to send the message to those governing our eastern lands, so we must hope they take the news well and come back into our fold. Since after all, only a fool would attempt to make a stand in the east by themselves right?"
GEX_foreign_east.3.a: "Splendid, send it forth"

GEX_foreign_east.4.t: "The Japanese reject our withdrawal"
GEX_foreign_east.4.d: "The Japanese have responded to our offer of a peaceful transfer by mocking us in a telegram, and shelling our colonial possessions ports. It seems their ambition is so great they reject all reason and peaceful conclusions, choosing conflict over the amount of time it would take to peacefully leave."
GEX_foreign_east.4.a: "I ain’t no fortunate son."

GEX_foreign_east.5.t: "A Victory of Japanese Ambitions"
GEX_foreign_east.5.d: "Our benefactors in the exiled colonial office have seemingly grown weak after their humbling, for now we have received orders to abandon the holdings they tasked us to maintain. They ask us to make preparations to leave this territory and move all our assets to their holdings where we will join with them. While we technically still serve them, many among our forces have a bitter taste leaving what we had to protect with blood, especially to the Japanese who will surely abuse these lands we hold.Now we must ask what to do as it seems if we do wish to put up a fight against the japanese to protect our lands, the wider German government will see us as traitors. Our leadership is at a crossroads as their loyalty to kaiser, but also to these lands we govern is in question."
GEX_foreign_east.5.a: "We have no choice"
GEX_foreign_east.5.b: "We shall not suffer such a fate, declare independence from the Reich!"
GEX_foreign_east.5.c: "We knew they couldn't be trusted"

GEX_foreign_east.6.t: "Mucke says yes"
GEX_foreign_east.6.d: "Although bitter, our colonial regime in East Asia under Von Mucke has agreed to abide by the treaty and withdraw. While this decision left him very bitter at having to leave his self created realm in Asia, his invaluable naval and marine assets are now back with us in our wider attempts to retake our home, especially since if he decided to fight, losing Mucke would have been devastating."
GEX_foreign_east.6.a: "United we sail home"

GEX_foreign_east.7.t: "Falkenhausen says yes"
GEX_foreign_east.7.d: "Although seemingly thrown under the bus when we told them that they had to abandon our concessions in China, the garrisons have reluctantly agreed. This is good news for our valuable advisors and even weapons stores have returned into our hands for the coming fight for the fatherland. While dreading the thought of what the japanese will do to the citizens within the concessions we ceded, Falkenhausen now is coming back to us with all the invaluable knowledge he carries."
GEX_foreign_east.7.a: "Yellow fever be damned"

GEX_foreign_east.8.t: "Mucke says no"
GEX_foreign_east.8.d: "Turns out throwing a naval commander who values his possessions under the bus makes him reluctant to comply with the peace terms, especially when he has the armada to do so (if only temporarily). While Japan is a looming giant that has the power to crush him, this hasn’t deterred Mucke, who only rallied the eastern fleets and marines under him in an attempt to save the lands they were tasked to hold, even if it's no longer under our sanction. This is tragic both in the future cost of lives but also the fact we now have no way of retrieving the fleets under his command that would have been invaluable to our cause."
GEX_foreign_east.8.a: "Seen coming a nautical mile away."

GEX_foreign_east.9.t: "Falkenhausen says no"
GEX_foreign_east.9.d: "Falkenhausen has surprised our government today by declaring he would not leave the concessions, as he grew a connection to it and could not bear to leave it to the fate of Japan’s hands. Although arguably futile against the might of Japan, He will stand against the coming Japanese when they come to take the lands, rallying the Chinese and even some German troops into defending those concessions. Not only tragic in the fact it will damage our image as they continue to fly the German banner in a last stand, he also denied us those extra garrison and advisors from returning home with us."
GEX_foreign_east.9.a: "55 days in Qingdao"

GEX_foreign_east.10.t: "Times up!"
GEX_foreign_east.10.d: "Our time limit that was explained in the treaty is finally up. Now Japanese ships come into the lands we are giving over, our troops all gone besides an honor guard to go through the ceremony of transferral. The International media are watching closely as their ships enter and we leave, with the German banner being descended over the concessions and ports we used to own. Despite this loss, at least we went through with it and managed both peace while also keeping our dignity intact."
GEX_foreign_east.10.a: "About time!"
GEX_foreign_east.10.b: "It feels as if they just disappeared."

GEX_foreign_east.11.t: "The Treaty is completed!"
GEX_foreign_east.11.d: "The imperialist Germans have actually gone through with their end of the deal, which shows they might have some honor left intact after all. Meeting an honor guard which went through the final ceremony of transferral, their flag descended, while the sun rose over their former lands, liberated by Japan as all asian lands shall be. This transferral gained us both valuable ports as well as prevented any bloodshed, meaning that we came out of this on top."
GEX_foreign_east.11.a: "Was there really any doubt?"

GEX_foreign_east.12.t: "An Avenue of Attack"
GEX_foreign_east.12.d: "Planning potential methods of invasion against Japan's territories, it has been seen as necessary to bring troops accross the sea, our general staff has proposed we further our focus of one of two methods, either means of transporting them via naval transports, though this would mean contesting the Japanese navy as is, a difficult prospect at the best of times, or focusing on producing transports by air and using paratroopers, though winning the air superiority necessary to get them to where they need to go is too, far easier said than done."
GEX_foreign_east.12.a: "Invasion by sea is the way to go"
GEX_foreign_east.12.b: "Paratroopers will have the element of surprise"

GEX_foreign_east.13.t: "Lessons of the Pacific War"
GEX_foreign_east.13.d: "Now that we have defeated the Japanese Empire, we are presented with the unique opportunity to learn lessons that could be the key to returning home."
GEX_foreign_east.13.a: "Reinforce the lessons learned in naval warfare"
GEX_foreign_east.13.b: "Mimic Japanese pilot training"
GEX_foreign_east.13.c: "Study their exotic torpedoes"
GEX_foreign_east.13.e: "Study the construction of Japanese Ships"
GEX_foreign_east.13.f: "Demand reparations"
GEX_foreign_east.13.g: "Demand military support"

GEX_foreign_east.15.t: "A Message from the German Exiles"
GEX_foreign_east.15.d:0  "Today, we received telegrams not from our Asian neighbors but from one of the former titans in Europe. The newly humiliated and exiled Germans seemingly haven't exhausted their thirst for war, and have consulted our ministers about launching a joint operation against the Japanese. With the Rising Sun eyeing a sizable portion of German holdings in the Pacific and in Asia, it is no surprise that Germany seeks allies; however, they don't seem to realize how truly vulnerable they are after the fall of Berlin. While the German delegation has pledged a decent portion of their remaining military power to assist us, many within our government are skeptical. If an opportunity to retake their seat in Europe arises, it would be probable that Germany would abandon their war effort to concentrate their resources on Europe, leaving us vulnerable to becoming another support for the Chrysanthemum Throne. However, if we were to succeed, the rewards could be great, as our regime could be secured and our influence projected across the power vacuum created by the Waning Sun. How should we proceed?"
GEX_foreign_east.15.a: "An enemy of Japan is a friend of ours!"
GEX_foreign_east.15.b: "The Germans cannot be trusted, especially without a home."
