GEX.12.d:0 "The German government has collapsed and fled to Africa, assuming control over their former colonies here.

Should we demand that they turn over the territories, on threat of continuing the war, or end it now?"

GEX_foreign.1.b:0 "Pffft, once a loser always a loser."

GEX_foreign_east.1.t:0 "The Fallen East"
GEX_foreign_east.1.d:0 "Our glorious fatherland has fallen, the emotional blow still striking our government even after we narrowly escaped and brought whatever assets we could. However it seems god himself isn’t relenting the fury brought upon our increasingly apathetic leadership, News has arrived from the east of vultures bearing down on our possessions. Even as we thought our far off possessions safe from the much larger stakes in Europe, it appears that the opportunists of the Japanese, guerilla groups and even other colonial regimes have taken our fall as a firesale in the east. Now we must decide what to do with this recent turning point.\nSome in our government, most particularly the apathetic ones are saying that we should just give up the east, as it’s already lost and any attempt to regain it draws resources away from our reclamation of the fatherland. However some remain adamant that we should intervene in the east, both to save the assets we have as well as an act of defiance to our recently grim fate. We have been trampled on before, but this will continue no further."
GEX_foreign_east.1.a:0 "It's a lost cause."
GEX_foreign_east.1.b:0 "We will not accept this humiliation, to war!."

GEX_foreign_east.2.t:0 "The Germans extend an olive branch"
GEX_foreign_east.2.d:0 "The Germans have sent us a telegram, after their loss in mainland Europe that exiled them to Africa, they are unwilling to fight and so offer us a deal. They will give us their eastern lands in exchange we let them move all their assets and troops out. While this does seem to be a good deal, it will both allow the Germans all their eastern military units to rejoin with their government and their future schemes, as well as take up the ever more scarce prospect, Time. So shall we let them leave peacefully within the year, or shall we take up arms in a swift conquest that will leave the Germans without their precious troops and gain us legitimacy in the eyes of potential Asian allies."
GEX_foreign_east.2.a:0 "We have triumphed"
GEX_foreign_east.2.b:0 "No Negotiations with Imperialists!"

GEX_foreign_east.3.t:0 "The Japanese accept our withdrawal"
GEX_foreign_east.3.d:0 "The Japanese have responded to our offer with acceptance, Allowing us to exit the east in peace which means we can conserve our strength in the wider fight to reclaim the homeland. Only thing now is that we have yet to send the message to those governing our eastern lands, so we must hope they take the news well and come back into our fold. Since after all, only a fool would attempt to make a stand in the east by themselves right?"
GEX_foreign_east.3.a:0 "Splendid, send it forth"

GEX_foreign_east.4.t:0 "The Japanese reject our withdrawal"
GEX_foreign_east.4.d:0 "The Japanese have responded to our offer of a peaceful transfer by mocking us in a telegram, and shelling our colonial possessions ports. It seems their ambition is so great they reject all reason and peaceful conclusions, choosing conflict over the amount of time it would take to peacefully leave."
GEX_foreign_east.4.a:0 "I ain’t no fortunate son."

GEX_foreign_east.5.t:0 "A Victory of Japanese Ambitions"
GEX_foreign_east.5.d:0 "Our benefactors in the exiled colonial office have seemingly grown weak after their humbling, for now we have received orders to abandon the holdings they tasked us to maintain. They ask us to make preparations to leave this territory and move all our assets to their holdings where we will join with them. While we technically still serve them, many among our forces have a bitter taste leaving what we had to protect with blood, especially to the Japanese who will surely abuse these lands we hold.Now we must ask what to do as it seems if we do wish to put up a fight against the japanese to protect our lands, the wider German government will see us as traitors. Our leadership is at a crossroads as their loyalty to kaiser, but also to these lands we govern is in question."
GEX_foreign_east.5.a:0 "We have no choice"
GEX_foreign_east.5.b:0 "We shall not suffer such a fate, declare independence from the reich!"
GEX_foreign_east.5.c:0 "We knew they couldn't be trusted"

GEX_foreign_east.6.t:0 "Mucke says yes"
GEX_foreign_east.6.d:0 "Although bitter, our colonial regime in East Asia under Von Mucke has agreed to abide by the treaty and withdraw. While this decision left him very bitter at having to leave his self created realm in Asia, his invaluable naval and marine assets are now back with us in our wider attempts to retake our home, especially since if he decided to fight, losing Mucke would have been devastating."
GEX_foreign_east.6.a:0 "United we sail home"

GEX_foreign_east.7.t:0 "Falkenhausen says yes"
GEX_foreign_east.7.d:0 "Although seemingly thrown under the bus when we told them that they had to abandon our concessions in China, the garrisons have reluctantly agreed. This is good news for our valuable advisors and even weapons stores have returned into our hands for the coming fight for the fatherland. While dreading the thought of what the japanese will do to the citizens within the concessions we ceded, Falkenhausen now is coming back to us with all the invaluable knowledge he carries."
GEX_foreign_east.7.a:0 "Yellow fever be damned"

GEX_foreign_east.8.t:0 "Mucke says no"
GEX_foreign_east.8.d:0 "Turns out throwing a naval commander who values his possessions under the bus makes him reluctant to comply with the peace terms, especially when he has the armada to do so (if only temporarily). While Japan is a looming giant that has the power to crush him, this hasn’t deterred Mucke, who only rallied the eastern fleets and marines under him in an attempt to save the lands they were tasked to hold, even if it's no longer under our sanction. This is tragic both in the future cost of lives but also the fact we now have no way of retrieving the fleets under his command that would have been invaluable to our cause."
GEX_foreign_east.8.a:0 "Seen coming a nautical mile away."

GEX_foreign_east.9.t:0 "Falkenhausen says no"
GEX_foreign_east.9.d:0 "Falkenhausen has surprised our government today by declaring he would not leave the concessions, as he grew a connection to it and could not bear to leave it to the fate of Japan’s hands. Although arguably futile against the might of Japan, He will stand against the coming Japanese when they come to take the lands, rallying the Chinese and even some German troops into defending those concessions. Not only tragic in the fact it will damage our image as they continue to fly the German banner in a last stand, he also denied us those extra garrison and advisors from returning home with us."
GEX_foreign_east.9.a:0 "55 days in Qingdao"

GEX_foreign_east.10.t:0 "Times up!"
GEX_foreign_east.10.d:0 "Our time limit that was explained in the treaty is finally up. Now Japanese ships come into the lands we are giving over, our troops all gone besides an honor guard to go through the ceremony of transferral. The International media are watching closely as their ships enter and we leave, with the German banner being descended over the concessions and ports we used to own. Despite this loss, at least we went through with it and managed both peace while also keeping our dignity intact."
GEX_foreign_east.10.a:0 "About time!"
GEX_foreign_east.10.b:0 "It feels as if they just disappeared."

GEX_foreign_east.11.t:0 "The Treaty is completed!"
GEX_foreign_east.11.d:0 "The imperialist Germans have actually gone through with their end of the deal, which shows they might have some honor left intact after all. Meeting an honor guard which went through the final ceremony of transferral, their flag descended, while the sun rose over their former lands, liberated by Japan as all asian lands shall be. This transferral gained us both valuable ports as well as prevented any bloodshed, meaning that we came out of this on top."
GEX_foreign_east.11.a:0 "Was there really any doubt?"

GEX_foreign_east.12.t:0 "An Avenue of Attack"
GEX_foreign_east.12.d:0 "Planning potential methods of invasion against Japan's territories, it has been seen as necessary to bring troops accross the sea, our general staff has proposed we further our focus of one of two methods, either means of transporting them via naval transports, though this would mean contesting the Japanese navy as is, a difficult prospect at the best of times, or focusing on producing transports by air and using paratroopers, though winning the air superiority necessary to get them to where they need to go is too, far easier said than done."
GEX_foreign_east.12.a:0 "Invasion by sea is the way to go"
GEX_foreign_east.12.b:0 "Paratroopers will have the element of surprise"

GEX_foreign_east.13.t:0 "Lessons of the pacific war"
GEX_foreign_east.13.d:0 "Now that we have defeated the Japanese Empire, we are presented with the unique opportunity to learn lessons that could be the key to returning home."
GEX_foreign_east.13.a:0 "Reinforce the lessons learned in naval warfare"
GEX_foreign_east.13.b:0 "Mimic Japanese pilot training"
