###NationalistTree###

ICE_fall_koldewey: "Fall Koldewey"
ICE_fall_koldewey_desc: "Fall Koldewey was the German codename for the Nationalist coup against the Socialists. The Nationalists, with generous German leadership and equipment, have managed to pull it off too. Now however the Nationalists lay in uncharted waters, almost literally. They are newly minted politicians at the head of a new nation and a coalition just as likely to tear itself apart rather than elect a new leader. Despite the inevitable tumult of the future, if they can overcome their problems there are boundless futures ahead of them."
ICE_blessa_stri: "The Blessed War"
ICE_blessa_stri_desc: "Despite our recent victory there is still much to be done in regards to the Socialist poison. While they are out of power the English and their Socialist puppets have retreated into the countryside to resist our takeover. Much of the land lies outside our grasp and government control, our government control has shrunk to cities and the roads connecting them. So, to liberate our land from Socialist tyranny and to finally drive the English taint from our soil we shall engage in our first conflict, a war blessed by God to save his children from debauchery and sin!"
ICE_maintaining_the_jernishyggja: "Nationmindedness"
ICE_maintaining_the_jernishyggja_desc: "Nationmindedness is a very weighted term in Icelandic history. Its meaning of nationalism and, by some interpretations, ethnonationalism, have had a major influence on all aspects of Iceland’s political scene, from left and right. However with our new administration looking diligently for some legitimacy, we have decided to champion the cause of Nationmindedness throughout the land. No more will Iceland be just another nation, it will be THE nation! A shining island in a sea of darkness!"
ICE_restore_the_ingvellir: "Restore the Thingvellir"
ICE_restore_the_ingvellir_desc: "With the Nationalist grip tight enough it seems the legislative mind has wandered to a new pet project. For most of Iceland’s storied history the Althing had been held at the Thingvellir just a short distance from Reykjavik. In the century since its abandonment however it has been relegated to a tourist trap. This is a shameful end to such a holy place! We shall restore it to its former glory and once more shall the Althing meet on its hallowed grounds!"
ICE_modernize_the_goor_system: "Modernize the Goðorð System"
ICE_modernize_the_goor_system_desc: "The Goðorð System was the system of government of Old Iceland from 930 to the settling of the Norwegian Yoke in 1262. It was a fantastically loose system with local chiefs making their own laws and any conflicts being settled at the annual Althing. The system was one to be admired even today and had kept peace on our isle for centuries. However a one to one transition into the modern day cannot do. WIth some touch ups here and there though Iceland will be a model nation."
ICE_rise_of_flokkur_jernissinna: "Rise of the Nationalist Party"
ICE_rise_of_flokkur_jernissinna_desc: "With the constant low-broiling tumult that has kept Iceland restless since our takeover the Nationalist’s grip has been left strong, but not as strong as it should be. That is why at the Althing it has been proposed that the various factions of the Nationalists put aside their petty differences and unite into a single party. With our resources pooled together we could finally stamp out what last resistance to our rule remains and finally get to governing rather than just running around and putting out fires."
ICE_land_j_og_tunga: "Land, Nation, Language"
ICE_land_j_og_tunga_desc: "Iceland is a unique nation, the most unique. It is a time capsule of an era long since passed where men were men and the world made sense. Its land still retains the mystic, untamed, arboreal feel that all of Northern Europe once had but had long since lost. Dense forests run up against sheer cliffs which plunge onto beaches covered in black, volcanic sand. The beaches then run out into the deep blue of the ever raging ocean, smashing against our shores trying to drag us below. Our language has been unchanged for centuries and not too far removed from Old Norse once spoken by the legendary Vikings. Such amazing things must be honored and honor them we shall."
ICE_a_nationalist_alingi: "A Nationalist Allthing"
ICE_a_nationalist_alingi_desc: "With our opposition scattered, the people tamed and the coalition at rest for now, its clear that the Nationalists finally have a secure grip on power. This grip shall now filter into the Althing which has been the main hub of legal rebellion against our new order. What few non-Nationalist members of the Althing shall be expelled and replaced with more compliant yes men and those opposition parties that still exist shall finally be squashed like the bugs they are and all of Iceland will finally march to the Nationalist drum."
ICE_honoring_the_lgsgumaur: "Honoring the Lawspeaker"
ICE_honoring_the_lgsgumaur_desc: "For over a thousand years the Althing was overlooked by a Lawspeaker who acted as its leader. That position was abolished with the Althing and has yet to be restored. For now the Head of State sits in on most meetings but he has better things to do then hear yet another argument over taxes or fishing quotas or whatever nonsense the Althing is arguing over today. So he has proposed that the Lawspeaker be restored to do it for him instead. Besides, if we are doing things as they once were, why not go all the way."
ICE_free_state_restored: "Free State Restored"
ICE_free_state_restored_desc: "Iceland has been traditionally hard to govern. Its location so far away from everywhere else, its rugged land and the independent spirit of the people have made many wannabe conquers think twice before making slaves of us. Only an Icelander knows how to govern Iceland, and we know to govern Iceland. That is why we have done much to restore the Free State of Iceland to being once more and finally have come out successful. While some will decry our state's decentralization, the good thing about a dictatorship is we don't have to listen to them."
ICE_the_beginnings_of_a_new_saga: "The Beginnings of a New Saga"
ICE_the_beginnings_of_a_new_saga_desc: "After much debate and political jockeying Eldur Kvaran and his cadre of Rightists have taken control of the Nationalist Party. Pledging a return to the Old Ways, Kvaran and his clique have left the nation enraptured by a vision of Iceland strong, independent and traditional. Suffice to say that many are also wondering how much of his wild declarations are fake, if any of them are."
ICE_dealing_with_standi: "Dealing with Ástandið"
ICE_dealing_with_standi_desc: "As the English occupied our soil, they had their way with our women. Untold thousands of rapes were committed for who would ever want to sleep with an occupier. Many of these crimes spawned children, children who now threaten our nation's future with their very existence! This...Situation as it's called needs to be addressed as soon as possible!"
ICE_legions_of_leiangr: "Icelandic Legions"
ICE_legions_of_leiangr_desc: "Iceland has never had an army since simply we never needed one. However with the world having come through the charnel pits of the First Weltkrieg and now seems dead set on charging into another; a nation without an army is begging for destruction. The English already set foot on our Island once before, now if they try again they will be met with thousands of proud Icelanders with the blood of Vikings in their veins. With enough guns and discipline, nobody could dare hope to pollute our holy soil once more."
ICE_hail_the_allsherjargoi: "Hail the Allsherjargoði!"
ICE_hail_the_allsherjargoi_desc: "The Allsherjargoði or All Peoples Chieftain is the man, traditionally a descendent of the first settler in Iceland Ingolfr Arnarson, who would sanctify the opening of the Althing. The position was abolished with the Althing in the 1200s but now, as we once again reach back to our illustrious past, shall be reformed. With all the interbreeding done on our island too it's not too far a stretch to name just about anybody to the post, confident that they have some ties back to Ingolfr."
ICE_our_norwegian_roots: "Our Norwegian Roots"
ICE_our_norwegian_roots_desc: "The first settlers of our fair isle were Norwegians, for many years we were dependent on Norway and finally in 1262 our nations were forced into being one. While we are Icelanders and proud of it, we all have deep roots in Norway too. Its time we exploit those roots to our benefit."
ICE_witness_the_rise_of_the_northman: "Witness the Rise of the Northman"
ICE_witness_the_rise_of_the_northman_desc: "In the centuries past the very term, Northmen, brought visions of strength and vigor. All through Europe we were known and more importantly, we were feared! Now however we are barely even thought of by the major powers, brushed aside like so many bugs on the street. Well we have finally rediscovered our ancient strength and when we are through all the world will tremble once more when the title Northman passes through someone’s lips once more!"
ICE_the_land_of_thule: "The Land of Thule"
ICE_the_land_of_thule_desc: "To many people of ancient times we were simply Thule, the great and unknown North. We were the land of barbarians and monsters where few lived long. To many today that view has not changed much. Knowing anything is a privilege that few even care to reach. We can use that to our advantage and spin wild stories that would strike fear in our enemies hearts."
ICE_a_orrablt_to_make_rr_proud: "A Þorrablót to make Thor Proud!"
ICE_a_orrablt_to_make_rr_proud_desc: "The Thorrablot of old were wild affairs full of parties, orgies and sacrifices. The blots are still celebrated today but, due to the corruption of Christianity they are rather duller than they once were. As we return Iceland to the old days of strength we shall inject some life into the Thorrablot once more and bring Iceland just that much closer to paradise."
ICE_bringing_ariosophy_to_iceland: "Bringing Ariosophy to Iceland"
ICE_bringing_ariosophy_to_iceland_desc: "Ariosophy has almost no presence in Iceland. Being so far away from the ideology’s birthplace in Austria and the fact that many Icelanders are poor as dirt means they don't know of and don’t care about what some old monk thinks. However they should. Ariosophy brings forth a fundamental truth of the world, the truth of the genetic strength of Icelanders as pure Ayrans. We shall introduce our people to this strength once more."
ICE_founding_the_satrarflagi: "Founding the Ásatrúarfélagið"
ICE_founding_the_satrarflagi_desc: "As Ariosophy catches on in our nation it has become requested that some sort of organization be founded to further cultivate its growth. The Astartu Fellowship will be that program. It will introduce all loyal and smart Icelanders to their illustrious heritage and awaken that ancient fury that once drove us to such greatness."
ICE_hvtramannaland_our_home: "Hvítramannaland... Our Home"
ICE_hvtramannaland_our_home_desc: "Our forefathers discovered America, not perfidious Albion. Markland, Vinland, Helluland and even Hvitramannaland, White People Land to the locals. This last one, Hvitramannaland, has attracted much interest in our administration. Its location, Labrador, makes possessing it a strategic boon and beating the Old British as well as the new makes that apple even sweeter."

ice.x.a: "WIP"
ice.x.b: "WIP"

#Intro Events#

ice.9996.t: "Iceland in 1922"
ice.9996.d: "Starting in 1874, Iceland had its first taste of independence when Denmark granted the colony the right to home rule and a constitution. As a part of Denmark, Iceland remained neutral throughout the Weltkrieg. After the conclusion of the Weltkrieg, Iceland joined the Mitteleuropa Economic Bloc alongside its master Denmark. This brought a period of prosperity to the island nation as Iceland could now tap into two markets for its main export: fish. The British market continued its lucrative fish imports from Iceland due to the distance between the two islands. Meanwhile, the entry of Icelandic Cod into the European Market became a source of smaller additional funds to help boost Iceland’s economy."
ice.9996.a: "What once was..."

ice.9997.t: "Iceland in 1925"
ice.9997.d: "However, this economic prosperity would not last forever. The British Revolution of 1925 shattered the miracle that post-weltkrieg Iceland was experiencing. As the royalists fled to various corners of the Empire, the British-Icelandic trade route instantly ran dry. The only close remainders of the cod trade were the royalists who fled to Canada but they had more pressing economic issues than resuming Icelandic trade. Thus, Iceland was left wallowing in the wake of the British Revolution since Mitteleuropan economic doctrine dictated that no trade could be enacted with Syndicalist countries."
ice.9997.a: "Is no longer..."

ice.9998.t: "Iceland in 1932"
ice.9998.d: "To help put a stopgap on the massive unemployment that started to rise in the country, the Althing created the City Work-Creation Scheme to put the people to work on manual labour construction projects. This worked for some time but eventually became a divisive topic between the parties in the government. During a city council meeting on the 9th of November 1932, the council debated pulling the plug on the project. News of this reached the population who arrived in droves to riot in front of the building demanding that the Scheme remains in place due to the fact that the economic recession still continued to afflict Iceland. This riot became known as Gúttóslagurinn and ensured that the CWCS remains in effect for the near future of the country."
ice.9998.a: "Will this crisis ever end?"

ice.9999.t: "Iceland in 1936"
ice.9999.d: "While the past decade has been a disaster for the people of Iceland, there still remains a hope for a brighter future over the horizon. Prospective government officials have started crafting plans for large scale public works projects to provide jobs, kick-starting a tourism industry, or even looking into tapping into the geothermal and hydroelectric resources that our island provides us with. Perhaps with a little assistance from Denmark, we can make these dreams come true!"
ice.9999.a: "Perhaps the end is near!"

#Cod War Events#
ice.1.t: "Iceland expands its fishing zones"
ice.1.d: "With our recent change in policy, our fishermen now have a much larger area to trawl fish from. This is expected to increase our haul by large margins. To that end, our merchants have already started looking towards our old trade partners in the British Empire to see if there is a possible economic deal we can make."
ice.1.a: "What a bountiful catch!"
ice.1.b: "Perhaps it'd be best to fully placate the Empire or the Syndicalists?"

ice.2.t: "Iceland expands their fishing zone"
ice.2.d: "Iceland has recently claimed large swathes of the North Atlantic as their rightful fishing grounds. This is bound to draw the ire of the Syndicalists in Britain but we could perhaps use this occasion to gain support in Iceland to eventually use as a staging ground for the reclamation of the home isles."
ice.2.a: "Offer Iceland a deal"
ice.2.b: "We can't risk it"

ice.3.t: "Iceland expands into British Waters!"
ice.3.d: "The Icelanders have expanded into our waters in the North Atlantic. They claim that they are only trying to get over the lingering effects of Black Monday but they nevertheless have created unrest from the Scottish fishermen in the north. They are a small nation and whatever fish they pull in won't affect us too badly but we have a chance to attempt to rekindle the trade agreement that our two Atlantic isles shared before the Revolution."
ice.3.a: "Attempt to form a deal"
ice.3.b: "There is plenty of fish in the sea"

ice.4.t: "Canada offers a deal"
ice.4.d: "The merchants of Canada have contacted us to express their interest in an economic deal between our two countries. As the largest successor state to the British Empire, they hope to resume the trade that our islands once shared."
ice.4.a: "To our friends in Ottawa!"

ice.5.t: "The Union of Britain offers a deal"
ice.5.d: "The merchant union in the Union of Britain has come to us to discuss the terms for a potential economic deal. Our two islands once shared a generous trade deal in the past but recent events of the last decade have caused the dissolution of that deal. They claim that now is the perfect time to renew the trade."
ice.5.a: "Once more shall the isles trade!"

ice.6.t: "Iceland receives multiple trade offers"
ice.6.d: "With our recent expansion, the powers on both sides of Atlantic are vying to get their piece of the cake. Both the Canadians and the syndicalists have made overtures to make new deals for our growing supply of cod. Which side should we create a trade agreement with?" 
ice.6.a: "Make a deal with Canada"
ice.6.b: "Make a deal with the Union of Britain"

ice.7.t: "Cod trade deal formed with Iceland"
ice.7.d: "Our merchants have successfully secured a deal with Iceland. This deal will help them get out of their economic slump and gain us a valuable ally in the North Atlantic."
ice.7.a: "Cross Atlantic cod trade begins!"

ice.8.t: "Canadian Cod deal signed"
ice.8.d: "The Canadians have agreed to a deal for our cod sales. We will now see a substantial increase in our profits from this."
ice.8.a: "A Sweet Catch"

ice.9.t: "Icelandic-Canadian deal signed"
ice.9.d: "The royalists have signed a deal with the locals of Iceland to encourage them to fish in our waters and take the fish that rightfully belongs to us. We must retaliate or face humiliation over being belittled by such a tiny nation."
ice.9.a: "Contest the Waters!"

ice.10.t: "Cod deal signed with Iceland"
ice.10.d: "Icelandic merchants have opted to resume the trade that our two nations shared in the past. Let the future of our islands grow prosperous together."
ice.10.a: "Atlantic cod trade begins"

ice.11.t: "Atlantic cod deal signed!"
ice.11.d: "With the signing of this deal, the Unionists have agreed to look past our intrusion upon their waters in exchange for giving them a significant portion of our new catches. This will allow a safer environment for our fishermen."
ice.11.a: "To our Atlantic allies!"

ice.12.t: "The English have made a deal with the Icelanders"
ice.12.d: "Those dastardly Unionists in England have struck a deal with Iceland for almost a complete monopoly on the cod sales gathered from the North Atlantic. We can't let that happen! Should we offer Iceland a new deal or quietly back down?"
ice.12.a: "A sweeter deal for Iceland"
ice.12.b: "A quiet exit from the cod trade"

ice.13.t: "Canada approaches us with a new deal"
ice.13.d: "Not willing to be pushed out of Iceland over a business deal, the Canadians have approached us with a new deal for our cod sales. They agree to pay a much higher price for the cod compared to our offer from the English. Should we switch sides and go with the Canadian deal, or stay committed to our English deal?"
ice.13.a: "To a brighter future with Canada!"
ice.13.b: "Our allegiance lies with England"

ice.14.t: "Contest the Waters!"
ice.14.d: "Icelandic fishing trawlers are claiming our waters and stealing catches that should be rightfully ours! How should we respond?"
ice.14.a: "Show them their place"

ice.15.t: "Warding off the trawlers"
ice.15.d: "Following this outrageous assumption of fishing rights from Iceland, we have sent a small detachment of destroyers out to stop this threat against our fishermen. The destroyers RNS Seawolf and Sparrowhawk have seen success in warding off any Icelandic fisherman who foolishly try to claim our waters."
ice.15.a: "Britannia rules the waves"

ice.16.t: "Fishermen Attacked"
ice.16.d: "In the past couple days, our fishermen have come under assault by a small squadron of destroyers sent from the Union of Britain to contest the waters. Following these attacks, less of our fishermen are willing to trawl the rich waters that we have just claimed ownership of from the English. As a consequence, we are not able to draw in as many fish for sale."
ice.16.a: "We won't back down over a few destroyers"

ice.17.t: "Retaliate against their trawlers?"
ice.17.d: "Some of our population calls for revenge against the English for attacking our fishermen. They clamour for us to equip some of our coast guard vessels to intercept English trawlers operating in our waters."
ice.17.a: "Cut their lines"
ice.17.b: "No need to stoop to their level"

ice.178.t: "Fishermen still in danger"
ice.178.d: "Despite our quiet withdrawal from the contested waters, the English continue to harass our fishermen. They are careful to stay within our previous territorial waters yet the English still viciously chase down our boats. Once more the fishermen are requesting that we mobilize some of our coast guard vessels with armament to protect them. Who would we be if we just left our people alone on the high seas?"
ice.178.a: "Mobilize the coast guard"
ice.178.b: "We can't risk the English response"

ice.179.t: "Fishermen march on the Althing"
ice.179.d: "Faced with a continual lack of government support, large groups of fishermen have started to gather in the capital to march on the Althing and demand action. This situation reminds many of when back in 1932 a group of workers started a riot over the City Work Creation Scheme. We are now faced with two options: either we cave to the fishermen and mobilize the coast guard, or we can try to plead mercy from the English. What does the government decide?"
ice.179.a: "The fishermen must be protected"
ice.179.b: "May the English find mercy"

ice.18.t: "English fishermen attacked"
ice.18.d: "We have received reports that Icelandic patrol boats from the coast guard have been equipped with net cutters and sent after our fishing boats. As the Icelandic vessel sails behind our trawlers, the trailing hook cuts our nets compromising our ability to collect fish. Our force in the North Atlantic is spread too thin to protect all our fishermen. We must send them reinforcements!"
ice.18.a: "Reinforce the squadron!"

ice.19.t: "A hero returns home"
ice.19.d: "In a daring raid against the English fishing trawler Carlisle, the crew of the Ægir found themselves under attack from a new English squadron that was freshly deployed to the region. The commander of the RNS Dunedin ordered his ship to ram the Ægir to protect their fishing vessel. After two ram attempts, the Ægir was barely left upright hanging on by a single screw. In an act of desperation, the commander of the Ægir gave the order to man the guns, in spite of the overwhelming firepower advantage that the Dunedin had at her disposal. Serviceman Guðmundur Kjærnested manned the 6 pounder to deter the Dunedin from finishing the fleeing patrol vessel off. News of the crew's heroism has swept across the nation and people are calling for the knighting of Guðmundur Kjærnested."
ice.19.a: "Remember the Ægir!"

ice.20.t: "Appeal to the Canadians for aid"
ice.20.d: "While the Ægir was successful in beating back the English, we don't have enough vessels to sustain an attritional battle against the English. We need some more substantial aid to protect our waters. Something that the Canadians ought to be able to provide. How much should we ask of them?"
ice.20.a: "Request troops and a naval force"
ice.20.b: "Request just a naval force"

ice.21.t: "Iceland requests aid from us"
ice.21.d: "The Icelandic government has approached us looking for military assistance. The waters off their coast are becoming more like a warzone every week as the coast guard and republican navy clash against each others fishing ships. Without our protection, the cod deal we have running with them could wither away as the Republican navy could cut off Iceland. They have asked for a detachment of troops to protect the island itself and several vessels to ward off the republican forces. How should we respond?"
ice.21.a: "Send them what they ask for"
ice.21.b: "We can only spare the naval force"
ice.21.c: "We can't spare anything"

ice.22.t: "Iceland requests aid from us"
ice.22.d: "The Icelandic government has approached us looking for military assistance. The waters off their coast are becoming more like a warzone every week as the coast guard and republican navy clash against each others fishing ships. Without our protection, the cod deal we have running with them could wither away as the Republican navy could cut off Iceland. They have asked for several vessels to ward off the republican forces. How should we respond?"
ice.22.a: "Send them what they ask for"
ice.22.b: "We can't spare anything"

ice.23.t: "Send off the navy"
ice.23.d: "Today marks the departure of the newly formed Northwest Atlantic Squadron for the Icelandic waters. The fleet is composed of the destroyers HMCS Sterling and Tactician led by the light cruiser HMCS Dauntless. Command will be issued from the HMCS Cumberland which will serve as the flagship. Together, our proud men set sail to protect our trade from those godless syndicalists in the Home Isles."
ice.23.a: "Good Luck and Godspeed!"

ice.24.t: "Canadian fleet arrives"
ice.24.d: "Our harbour was busy today as the Canadian ships we requested have just arrived. The English destroyer RNS Seawolf had been prowling after a few of our fishing trawlers waiting for an opportune moment to disrupt our haul for the day but the arrival of the Northwest Atlantic Squadron had the destroyer fleeing with its tail between its legs. The Canadian sailors were given a cheerful greeting by our fishermen on the docks as they pulled into the harbour."
ice.24.a: "Welcome Canadians!"

ice.25.t: "Canadian armed forces arrive"
ice.25.d: "On a bit of a quieter note, forces from Canada have landed in Akureyri last night. They opted to take a more indirect route through the Arctic waters to avoid catching the notice of any English vessels. In the event that we are attacked, we will be better prepared to hold back the enemy."
ice.25.a: "Reassuring"

ice.26.t: "No aid from Canada"
ice.26.d: "Disappointing news came today as our envoy to Canada has reported back that the Canadians are unwilling to devote any resources to help protect us and the cod trade between our two countries. We can not expect any aid from Canada from the Republican navy."
ice.26.a: "We stand alone"

ice.27.t: "More lost fishing trawlers"
ice.27.d: "As the week continues since the Canadians neglected to send support to us, we have had massive problems with the Republican navy. Their bolstered forces are able to terrorize our vessels and restrict nearly all fishing off of our southern coast. We have contacted Canada to inform them of the cancellation of our trade agreement due to our inability to protect our fishermen."
ice.27.a: "We must admit defeat..."

ice.28.t: "Fishing deal with Iceland is ended"
ice.28.d: "Iceland's fishermen are ruthlessly attacked without our aid which has severely diminished the amount of fish they can haul as fewer fishermen are willing to go out on the seas. To this end, the merchants from Iceland have informed us that the trade deal between our countries is at an end."
ice.28.a: "Unfortunate"

ice.29.t: "Send an ultimatum to Iceland?"
ice.29.d: "With the situation in Iceland firmly under our control, we now face a crossroads. We could send some representatives to Iceland to 'suggest' that they form a new syndicalist government under our guidance. Or we could leave them alone on their island without any other major allies."
ice.29.a: "Send some representatives"
ice.29.b: "Let them remain isolated"

ice.291.t: "Ultimatum from England"
ice.291.d: "text"
ice.291.a: "We must bow"

ice.30.t: "Alone in the Atlantic"
ice.30.d: "As the cod war draws to a close, the Union of Britain stands dominant over us. However, they have contented themselves with merely leaving us adrift, alone, and allyless in the Atlantic. Now we must figure out what to do with our mourning country."
ice.30.a: "Looking to the East"

ice.31.t: "Canadian Fleet Arrives"
ice.31.d: "The royalists have recently arrived in Iceland to help them claim our waters as their own!. The presence of their squadron has our republican navy on the back foot. We need a new strategy for our probes into the Atlantic."
ice.31.a: "Get Aggressive"
ice.31.b: "Stick Together"

ice.32.t: "Aggressive strikes from the English"
ice.32.d: "While the Canadian squadron has been effective in stopping some attacks against our trawlers, frequently our fishermen have found themselves under attack before they can radio for help in time. With a force of planes flying recon overhead, we can get the edge we need against the Republican navy."
ice.32.a: "Request planes for aerial recon"

ice.33.t: "All quiet in the North Atlantic"
ice.33.d: "For now, the skirmishes in the Atlantic have come to a close. The Canadians and English have been eyeing each other up as the fleets shadow each other's movements. Neither side has been willing to force an engagement as the Canadians do not want to be seen as the aggressors while the English are unwilling to make a move against the overwhelming firepower of the modern heavy cruiser that leads the Canadian squadron."
ice.33.a: "Peace at last!"

ice.34.t: "Iceland requests scout planes"
ice.34.d: "The government of Iceland has requested a lease of scout planes to help our squadron better protect their merchant's vessels."
ice.34.a: "Send them the planes"
ice.34.b: "We can't spare anything"

ice.35.t: "Canada sends scout planes"
ice.35.d: "The government in Canada has authorized the shipment of a wing of scout planes to help us defend our merchants."
ice.35.a: "Thanks, Canada!"

ice.36.t: "Canada does not send any scout planes"
ice.36.d: "The Canadian government has told us that their planes are needed more elsewhere in the world."
ice.36.a: "Unfortunate"

ice.37.t: "A daring plan for the Atlantic"
ice.37.d: "Admiral Norman Holbrook has come to us with a plan to break the Canadians stationed in Iceland. Recently returned from a hunting trip, Holbrook had inspiration come to him. Eventually, everyone falls into a routine pattern. He believes if we track the Canadians long enough they will eventually reveal a pattern of when they retire to harbour. Once we learn the timing, we can send a submarine in to blow their armoured cruiser before they even know what is happening, giving us the edge in the Atlantic!"
ice.37.a: "Authorize the raid"
#ice.37.b: "The plan is too risky" #Not used currently

ice.38.t: "The raid on the Cumberland"
ice.38.d: "Tonight marked the appointed night of the raid. Our brave submarine crew operating underneath Holbrook took to the sea and carefully made their way to the harbour where the Canadian fleet was docked for the night. Due to the lax nature of the recent conflict in the Atlantic, there seemed to be no real attempt to post adequate sentries to stand guard against something like this. As Holbrook surfaced he fired two salvoes of torpedoes into the HMCS Cumberland. The first salvo was ineffective, bouncing off the hull, but the second salvo ripped a massive hole into the starboard hull immediately causing it to list over and begin to flood. Following this display of fireworks, Holbrook and his crew submerged and began their escape back to the safety of English waters."
ice.38.a: "In and out clean"

ice.39.t: "Claxons in the night"
ice.39.d: "Chaos rang out in the harbour last night. The peace over the last month has led to our guard being more relaxed than it should have been. For tonight saw the loss of our heavy cruiser the HMCS Cumberland. Aboard, we lost some 300 sailors as the ship sunk fairly quickly. We suspect some of the ammunition was improperly stored below the deck or a that a boiler had a mechanical failure overnight. No matter the reason, this loss is felt deeply by everyone in Iceland and Canada."
ice.39.a: "Chaos in the Harbour"

ice.40.t: "Sombre news from Iceland"
ice.40.d: "We have received grave news from Iceland today. Overnight, the heavy cruiser, HMCS Cumberland experienced a sudden explosion causing the ship to sink rapidly. The cause of the explosion is not known at this time but the incoming reports list at least 300 sailors lost in this tragic incident."
ice.40.a: "A day of mourning"

ice.41.t: "The fate of the Cumberland"
ice.41.d: "Following the tragedy of the Cumberland, we have dispatched divers to search the wreckage for any more information that we missed in the chaos of the night. By the afternoon, our divers found the smoking gun. Almost literally. They found an intact syndicalist torpedo of English design laying on the bottom of the port. This tragedy was not a mechanical failure but a deliberate assault from the Union of Britain against us! We will not stand for this!"
ice.41.a: "Demand an apology!"

ice.42.t: "Cumberland submarine raid discovered"
ice.42.d: "This morning we received a telegram from the government of Iceland demanding reparations for the sinking of the HMCS Cumberland. They claim to have indisputable evidence against us that prove we were the ones responsible for the loss of their ship. Our submarine crew claim they were in and out without being detected. How should we respond to this outrageous accusation?"
ice.42.a: "Deny our role"
ice.42.b: "Boast about our role in the sinking"

ice.43.t: "The English response to the Cumberland Telegram"
ice.43.d: "The English are denying their role in the sinking of the HCMS Cumberland. However, the torpedo we found is definite proof of their dastardly deed. The international community must know of the heinous nature of those in the Union of Britain to attack a ship full of boys in the dead of night."
ice.43.a: "They will be forced to admit the truth"

ice.44.t: "The English response to the Cumberland Telegram"
ice.44.d: "The English have responded to our telegram with boasts. They boast proudly about their daring crewmen who were willing to sail into the jaws of our harbour to inflict damage upon us. They claim that they were only protecting their fishermen with a forward defence. The Canadians must know of the cruelty of their English brothers."
ice.44.a: "Those devils!"

ice.45.t: "English Torpedoes found near the corpse of the Cumberland"
ice.45.d: "News has come from Iceland in regards to the cause of the sinking of the HMCS Cumberland. Divers found an intact English torpedo that failed to detonate when it was launched against the hull of the Cumberland. The explosion was not an internal mechanical failure after all but an insidious attempt by the English to cowardly attack us during the night. Our people clamour for revenge over the loss of our young men aboard the Cumberland who never made it to shore."
ice.45.a: "The people shall be heard!"

ice.46.t: "Spies report back from Canada"
ice.46.d: "Our spies in Canada have reported back to us about the public opinion in Canada towards Iceland since the sinking of the Cumberland. In contrast to what we thought, the surprise attack did not discourage them but rather embolden them. They remain resolute in their commitment to Iceland. How should we proceed?"
ice.46.a: "Blockade Iceland"
ice.46.b: "Back Down"

ice.47.t: "Free reign over the waters!"
ice.47.d: "In an unexpected turn of events, the English have opted to back down from the skirmishes in the Icelandic waters. This places us as the undisputed masters of the waves around our island. Our fishermen are now free to resume catching fish without fear of any attacks from the Republican navy. We could not have done this without the aid of Canada."
ice.47.a: "Britannia no longer rules the waves"

ice.48.t: "Ships all across the horizon"
ice.48.d: "This morning our merchants woke to a horrifying sight: the horizon filled with English warships. In a display of power, the English have stationed their supercarrier the Rebecca 5 miles off the shore from Reykjavik. Bombers have flown over Reykjavik dropping thousands of pamphlets that state that our trade with the Canadians is now at an end and that we are strongly advised to heed whatever demands the English send to us."
ice.48.a: "Cut off from our friends in the west"

ice.49.t: "North Sea Squadron Trapped"
ice.49.d: "As the English descend on Iceland, our detachment of ships has become trapped in the Icelandic ports. Any attempt to break out of the blockade would be a bloodbath. They are effectively trapped."
ice.49.a: "May God help them"

ice.50.t: "The Blockade of Iceland"
ice.50.d: "Our blockade over the course of the last week has been a great success. All trade with the royalists in Canada has ceased on Iceland. Our intelligence reports no action from the Canadians to relieve their trapped squadron of sailors in Iceland. We have Iceland right where we want them."
ice.50.a: "A successful operation"

ice.51.t: "Delivering the Demands"
ice.51.d: "Following a two week period of blockade, their merchants and traders must be desperate for some ability to resume trade. We have proposed a treaty for them. In the deal, we press our claims over the waters, which naturally give us a sizeable portion of all profits that come from fish caught by Icelandic fishermen. Any disagreement with said policy would be seen as an attack against our sovereign waters and would be subject for military intervention."
ice.51.a: "Force their hand"

ice.52.t: "England offers a new deal"
ice.52.d: "English merchants delivered an ultimatum to our merchants earlier today. They landed at Reykjavik and demanded a meeting with the prominent traders of Iceland. They brought with them a document in which they pressed their claims over the waters, which entitled them to a sizeable portion of all profits from fish caught by Icelandic fishermen. Any disagreement with their deal would be seen as an attack against their sovereign waters and they say they will not hesitate to send in the military to ensure we honour the bargain."
ice.52.a: "Reject their extortion"
ice.52.b: "We have no choice but to bow"

ice.53.t: "Organizing the Defence of Iceland"
ice.53.d: "Following our rejection of their ridiculous demands, the English merchants left in a big huff of hot air. We don't expect they would make any empty threats after their raid on the Cumberland. Therefore, we must prepare for their incoming attack. How should we proceed?"
ice.53.a: "To arms!"
ice.53.b: "Organize an underground resistance"

ice.54.t: "Iceland rejects our demands"
ice.54.d: "With their rejection of our terms, we now have a justifiable excuse to land forces on their island. They have no military of any means and would have no means to resist us. Should we land a large force in a display of power, or use our resources elsewhere and deploy a smaller force?"
ice.54.a: "Display our power"
ice.54.b: "A small force will do the job"

ice.55.t: "Iceland lies defeated"
ice.55.d: "The Icelanders attempted to offer up resistance with the help of their Canadian allies at the beaches. They, however, were no match for our Republican marines who made short work of them. We now stand atop our conquered isle."
ice.55.a: "Triumph"

ice.56.t: "Uncontested Landing"
ice.56.d: "Our forces have successfully landed on Iceland. The locals put up no resistance and we were able to quickly secure key positions throughout Reykjavik and take control of the island."
ice.56.a: "Who can hope to stand against us?"

ice.57.t: "Operation Fork Foiled!"
ice.57.d: "We underestimated the tenacity of the Icelandic people. They were able to mount a sturdy defence with the aid of their Canadian allies and beat back our small landing parties into the sea. With this setback, we look like fools on the international scene with our failure to project power against a country as small as Iceland."
ice.57.a: "How could this happen?"

ice.58.t: "Defeat in Iceland"
ice.58.d: "Our forces attempted to fight a pitched battle to retain control of Iceland. Unfortunately, the English came in too large numbers and were able to defeat us."
ice.58.a: "Catastrophe!"

ice.59.t: "Organize a commando resistance?"
ice.59.d: "Without boots on the ground, our visible presence in Iceland has been finished. Should we attempt to send commandos to Iceland to help organize a local resistance against English rule?"
ice.59.a: "A good idea"
ice.59.b: "Too risky"

ice.591.t: "Organize a commando resistance?"
ice.591.d: "The people of Iceland are not content to lie under the heel of the Union of Britain. They have requested that we send a small force of commandos to help them drive off the English. Should we send them?"
ice.591.a: "Send the men"
ice.591.b: "The plan is too risky"

ice.60.t: "Defeat in the field"
ice.60.d: "We gambled everything we had on this one attempt to drive the English back. Despite our best efforts, the English simply kept coming and blew through our limited defenders. The English have been quick to implement martial law and our government does not have long until they receive a demand that they can not refuse."
ice.60.a: "Once more under the yoke"

ice.61.t: "Iceland's new government"
ice.61.d: "With our conquest of the island, our delegations have been busy drafting up a new government for us to install on Iceland. The previously marginalized syndicalist population will be given control of a new Althing that ultimately answers to us."
ice.61.a: "A new government for the island"

ice.62.t: "English troops in Reykjavik"
ice.62.d: "English troops landed on Iceland earlier today and quickly seized control of all the key government buildings. The Althing is expecting to receive demands from the Union of Britain any day now."
ice.62.a: "We stood no chance"

ice.63.t: "English troops beaten back"
ice.63.d: "Our forces in Iceland successfully held off an English attack on the island. Their heroism will be remembered for a long time as revenge for the Cumberland!"
ice.63.a: "Remember the Cumberland!"

ice.64.t: "Successful defence of Iceland"
ice.64.d: "Our Canadian allies were able to push the English back into the sea when they attempted a landing with a small contingent of troops. For now, the island retains its independence."
ice.64.a: "Thanks to Canada!"

ice.65.t: "The Icelandic Question"
ice.65.d: "With the failure of our ground forces, the navy has come forward to offer their support for a new operation. This would involve sailing the Rebecca right off the port of Reykjavik and sending bombers to target their infrastructure and harbour facilities to demonstrate what we are capable of. This would likely draw the ire of the international community. Our other option would be to back down out of the waters and hope that this debacle fades from memory."
ice.65.a: "Make an example of Iceland"
ice.65.b: "Back Down"

ice.66.t: "England backs down from the Atlantic"
ice.66.d: "The representative from the Union of Britain has announced that the Union of Britain is withdrawing from its current affairs in the North Atlantic. This means we are free to align ourselves with our Canadian trade partners and protectors."
ice.66.a: "Free from their tyranny"

ice.67.t: "Reykjavik bombed!"
ice.67.d: "Panic broke out overnight as the RNS Rebecca sailed up to the Reykjavik port and launched wave after wave of bombers. They struck with precision crippling what little infrastructure we have and the port facilities. Other waves dropped mass pamphlets that called for Iceland to adopt a policy of isolation in the Atlantic. It will take some time to rebuild this damage!"
ice.67.a: "Luckily the people are alright"

#Recovery Events#

ice.74.b: "A small austerity budget!"

ice.75.t: "The Question of Fund Allocation"
ice.75.d: "As our nation is thrown into great economic crisis, the people have cried out in a request for aid. Our coffers are very light so we will only be able to send a token gesture to one side. Who should we help relieve?"

ice.76.b: "The rural population needs our help more"

ice.77.t: "The Rural Population Protests"
ice.77.d: "Since we have elected to give our resources to support the urban population of Iceland, the post has been filled with letters from the outlying communities with their complaints. They argue that their goods are what give those in the city jobs and that without the rural community, the urban community would be unable to survive."
ice.77.a: "If we find the money..."
ice.77.b: "A strong capital will share its wealth out later"

ice.81.t: "Continue the Radio Broadcasts?"

ice.82.t: "Iceland Asks for Financial Relief"
ice.82.d: "The government of Iceland has come forward to us with a request for financial assistance during this crisis that we find ourselves in after Black Monday. They claim that with the injection of Danish cash into the Icelandic economy, they will be able to finance their own recovery programs. The amount that they ask for is relatively small due to the difference in population density between our two nations. Should we grant them this request?"
ice.82.a: "We must help our people!"
ice.82.b: "They must help themselves"

ice.83.t: "Denmark sends Financial Relief"

ice.84.a: "We must weather this alone"

ice.85.t: "A Charitable People"
ice.85.d: "The people of Iceland have gone above and beyond to reach out a helping hand to their neighbours in need. Churches all across the island have started donation drives and opened their doors to any and all who come seeking help. If everyone could love their neighbour as much as these men and women do, then the world might just turn out to be a better place."
ice.85.a: "May the Lord smile on their kindness"

ice.86.t: "Running a Census"
ice.86.d: "With our commitment to aiding the rural population, we need an accurate account of where they are located and in what numbers. Due to the general lack of communications infrastructure across the island, the census must be taken via messengers sent out from Reykjavik. Many generous herders near Reykjavik have offered some of their horses to be used to send riders off."
ice.86.a: "Send out the riders"

ice.87.t: "Sending Out Aid"
ice.87.d: "With preliminary reports coming in, the aid for the rural population has begun to be doled out to the people. Carts and wagons are loaded up and then sent in teams out into the countryside to reach the more remote settlements on the island."

#Status Quo Tree Events#
ice.90.t: "Temperance Movement Protests"

ice.90.a: "What is one drink here or there?"

ice.91.t: "Reform the Taxes"
ice.91.d: "As the government has taken a larger role in creating work opportunities for our people, we have increasingly run into budgetary restraints. With a new tax system, we can afford to continue these projects and keep people working"

ice.91.b: "No need"

ice.100.t: "Reducing our Austerity Budget"
ice.100.d: "It has been several years since the disastrous crash of Black Monday that threw our struggling economy into shambles. To that end, it is time to consider cutting back on the austerity budget that we have imposed on our people. The times have seen recent improvement in our situation that will allow us to start to slowly start reducing the severity of our budget. The people would surely appreciate this cutback. What shall we do?"
ice.100.a: "Reduce our austerity budget"
ice.100.b: "Stay at our current budget"

ice.101.t: "Austerity Budget reduced, when should we revisit our situation?"

ice.111.t: "Requesting a Canadian garrison force"
ice.111.d: "We stand only a short distance away from the Union of Britain.

#CWCS#

ice.150.t: "The State of the Roads"
ice.150.d: "The infrastructure of Iceland has never been the top priority as most activities took place on the coast where the boat was the better form of transportation. As Iceland attempts to modernize, our backwards infrastructure really shows its age. What few roads that exist on the island are only seasonal and are in extremely poor condition."
ice.150.a: "We must do something about this"

ice.151.t: "Warm Water Piping"
ice.151.d: "A recent development in Iceland is the installation of warm water piping in certain parts of Reykjavik. Discovered when a farmer set a pipe to draw steam into his house a few years ago, the idea caught on quickly. Many schools and hospitals in the city were the first buildings to receive hot water pipes, but the pipe system has started to make its way into peoples homes now. Soon the whole city will be able to draw a hot bath with ease due to our abundant thermal springs beneath our island."
ice.151.a: "May a warm bath, warm our spirits"

#Generic Events#

ice.170.t: "Geysir Donation"
ice.170.d: "Iceland is home to several hot water geysers which have a tendency to draw crowds due to their beautifully explosive nature. Previously, this geyser was hidden away and used as a business venture to earn money from any who wished to watch the geyser erupt. Inspired by the charity of the nation, the owner has removed the fence and donated the geyser to the Icelandic people in perpetuity!"
ice.170.a: "A most generous donation"

ice.171.t: "Grand Opening of the Hydroelectric Plant"
ice.171.d: "Today marks the completion of the Laxárstöð Hydroelectric Plant. This singular plant has the capacity to quadruple our local power production on the island. May this new achievement help drive the recovery of our people and propel us to new and greater heights!"
ice.171.a: "To a brighter future!"

ice.172.t: "Hummock studies"
ice.172.d: "Scientists continue to study the effects that these grassy 'bumps' or hummocks have on the soil.

ice.172.a: "If it works, it works"

ice.173.t: "Farming Communities"
ice.173.d: "Small farming communities have started to be examined by government officials in search of ways that they could be managed better during these trying times.

ice.174.t: "Packing the Barrels"
ice.174.d: "A crucial part of the export business is the packing of barrels of fish to be sent abroad and sold. We must invest in proper infrastructure to make sure that we don't run into any bottlenecks due to overcrowding on the docks."

ice.175.t: "A New Source of Power"
ice.175.d: "Engineers in Iceland have come forward with ideas to bring large amounts of power to the island to help with industrialization. The bountiful rivers and waterfalls carry an immense amount of energy that just passes us by. If we could create dams in some of our rivers, we might be able to harness Mother Nature's gift for our benefit."
ice.175.a: "An untapped spring"

ice.176.t: "Expansion of Vestmannaeyjar"
ice.176.d: "As the fishing industry grows, so too do the towns that support such businesses. While the harbour is too shallow for larger more modern vessels, the coastal town of Heimaey remains a crucial part of the cod fishing industry that is run off of the southern coast of Iceland. Already efforts are under way to streamline the transfer of catches from newer vessels to smaller ships that can bring the haul to the city for processing."
ice.176.a: "This can only grow busier"

ice.177.t: "A Modern Fleet"
ice.177.d: "The smaller ships that we have used in the past can not hope to handle the amount of fish that Iceland needs to recover from Black Monday. We must invest in larger vessels that are better suited for keeping up with the demands of the modern era."
ice.177.a: "Farewell old friend"

#Black Monday#
ice.200.t: "Black Monday strikes the Island!"
ice.200.d: "The economic collapse that originated in Germany has now reached the shores of Iceland. Our already tenuous hold over the economy has shattered and we have been left reeling. A total reorganization of Iceland will be needed to fix this crisis."
ice.200.a: "Catastrophe!"

#1937 Vote#
ice.250.t: "Plebiscite of 1936"
ice.250.d: "The time has come to vote over the continuation of Danish rule over Iceland. A generally ineffective response to helping the plight of the people of Iceland during the recent economic crisis has shaken the faith of the people in Danish rule. The cries for independence grow louder with every passing week. As the polls draw to a close, the results point to a desire"
ice.250.a: "For an independent Iceland!"
ice.250.b: "To remain in the Danish sphere!"

ice.251.t: "Independence Victory!"
ice.251.d: "With the recent victory of the vote for independence from Denmark, the althingi has been a rush with ministers declaring for one party or the other. The one constant is an upswing in the members who are a part of the Independence Party coalition."
ice.251.a: "To more prosperous times!"

ice.252.t: "Loyalty to Denmark"
ice.252.d: "No matter the economic crisis that has polarized many on the isle, Icelanders are not a rebellious people. We will do our part as a constituent of the Kingdom of Denmark to care for our corner of the realm without cutting ties with the rest. This has unfortunately had the effect of radicalizing part of the hardline independence wing."
ice.252.a: "We must remain a beacon of calm."

#Leaving Mitteleuropa#
ice.253.t: "Iceland leaves Mitteleuropa"
ice.253.d: "With our latest extension of freedom from Denmark, we are free to forge our own way separate from the ailing Mitteleuropan economic bloc. Some merchants are apprehensive towards our uncertain future but are hopeful to find more lucrative deals."

ice.254.t: "Iceland leaves Mitteleuropa"
ice.254.d: "The people of Iceland have elected to leave the Mitteleuropan sphere and attempt to forge a new web of independent trade. This could be an opportunity for us to find an ally closer to the home isles."
ice.254.a: "Interesting"

ice.255.t: "Iceland leaves Mitteleuropa"
ice.255.d: "The people of Iceland have elected to leave the Mitteleuropan sphere and attempt to forge a new web of independent trade. This could be an opportunity for us to find an ally closer to the royalists in exile."
ice.255.a: "Interesting"

ice.256.t: "Iceland Elects to End Their Personal Union"
ice.256.d: "After the Weltkrieg, in 1921, Iceland, at the time fully part of Denmark was given its independence, under personal union with Denmark and with Denmark taking care of Iceland's foreign policy until possible revision by plebiscite in 1946, 25 years after Iceland's independence. As such, they came along into Mitteleuropa and they remained in general in a course with us. However, Iceland's position makes their Mitteleuropa membership less than ideal, and as such, the island declined over the years. Under the dissent that this caused, Icelandic politicians had expedited the referendum, and the Icelandic people elected to end our relationship. A republic will be declared in Reykjavik and Iceland has let us know that they no longer need our foreign ministry to treat Icelanders as if they were Danes."
ice.256.a: "So be it"

ice.257.t: "Iceland Elects to Remain in Their Personal Union"
ice.257.d: "After the Weltkrieg, in 1921, Iceland, at the time fully part of Denmark was given its independence, under personal union with Denmark and with Denmark taking care of Iceland's foreign policy until possible revision by plebiscite in 1946, 25 years after Iceland's independence. As such, they came along into Mitteleuropa and they remained in general in a course with us. However, Iceland's position makes their Mitteleuropa membership less than ideal, and as such, the island declined over the years. Under the dissent that this caused, Icelandic politicians had expedited the referendum, but the Icelandic people elected to maintain our relationship. Iceland shall thus remain in our sphere for the coming years."
ice.257.a: "Ah, splendid"

ice.258.t: "Jon Baldvinsson Retires from Office"
ice.258.d: "A popular member of the Althingi and leader of the Social Democrat Party has recently announced his plans to step away from office. Citing his failing health, he has decided to pass the torch on to Stefan Stefansson to continue to lead the Social Democrat Party."
ice.258.a: "We wish him the best"

ice.300.t: "Restructuring the Banks"
ice.300.d: "The current situation in Iceland does not suit anyone as the banking system has completely failed following the disaster of Black Monday. Two camps have formed which argue too separate views for how the banks should be rebuilt. One group believes that the only way forward is through a strong centrally planned bank, while the other argues that a series of separate specialized banks are how the people of Iceland will recover best from this crisis. Which group should we endorse?"
ice.300.a: "One Island, One Bank!"
ice.300.b: "Delegate to smaller banks"

ice.301.t: "Purchasing a New Design"
ice.301.d: "Our current ships are ill-suited for the modern market. As we seek to improve, we must contact our Nordic neighbours and request a purchase of some of their latest designs. Who should we conduct business with?"

ice.301.b: "Deal with Denmark"
ice.301.c: "Neighbour Norway"

ice.350.t: "Iceland Getting Rebellious"
ice.350.d: "Our forces on Iceland have intercepted a radio signal broadcasting to the locals in an attempt to antagonize their view of us. We know that they lack the means to drive us off the island so should we let them talk or shall we bulk up our forces slightly?"
ice.350.a: "Authorize an additional force"
ice.350.b: "What could they do?"

ice.351.t: "The Future of Iceland in the Entente"
ice.351.d: "With the victory of Canada and the Entente navy during the Cod Wars, our Iceland now finds itself no longer adrift - now tethered to the whims of Ottawa and the Anglos. With this new status quos, and with our people now free from Copenhagen, the Canadian government has moved to ‘aid’ us in reorganizing our government. A new head of state shall rise, but who that being shall be is up for debate. Thor Thors, a long-standing fixture of the domestic Icelandic political scene and one of the most powerful men on the island, is a popular candidate. Under this conservative lawyer, Iceland shall rise as a republic within the Entente. However, with the backing of these new allies, support for a domestic Icelandic monarchy has also cropped up. The two main figures put forth as possible monarchs are the Canadian King [CAN.getleader], and the granddaughter of the late King Edward VII - Princess Alexandra Victoria Alberta Edwina Louise Duff. With these two proud and loyal Anglos also having their supporters, the future of Iceland truly is up in the air, but one thing is for certain: the Entente’s grasp around the small Icelandic archipelago has been sealed."
ice.351.a: "Princess Alexandra shall be the first Queen of Iceland!"
ice.351.b: "The Anglo King shall take the throne."
ice.351.c: "Thor Thors shall be the liaison between Ottawa and the Icelandic people."

ice.600.t: "Cutting the Tape at the New Factory"

ice.600.a: "Let the catches come in"

ice.399.t: "Nationalist Rebellion"
ice.399.d: "It seems our Socialist government was not as popular as we had thought. Almost unexpectedly a group of nationalists have begun to take power. All across the island nationalist militia are moving into important areas and in Reykjavik much of the city has become a battleground. While much of the lower levels of government have temporarily relocated, most of the top government officials remain in the city despite the danger. As civilians scurry for cover and more fighting men pour into the city it's anybody’s guess who will come out on top."
ice.399.a: "The People's Will is victorious!"
ice.399.b: "The Socialist poison has been cut out!"

ice.400.t: "Fall Koldewey"
ice.400.d: "Today we have received a message from our backers in Berlin. They have congratulated us wholeheartedly on our victory. They have also taken the time to remind us of our promises to bring Iceland further into the Reichspakt. While the German guns were valuable, and even more were sent with this message, already resentment is building against Berlin. We are proud Icelanders! We threw off the lapdogs of Copenhagen but not to just become lapdogs of Berlin! For the time however we must bide our time and play nice. Who knows what opportunities the future may bring. Besides, we could always use the guns."
ice.400.a: "We shall do what is expected of us."
ice.400.b: "Iceland shall never bow again!"

ice.401.t: "The Gathering of the Nationalist Allthing"
ice.401.d: "Until now the Nationalists had no real leader and that was fine. There were many things to be done after all and political factionalism fell by the wayside. However, with our power secure and normalcy returning, arguments and fights are breaking out in the coalition. To remedy this a new Althing has been called to sort out the Nationalist cause and decide what course we will take moving forwards. The largest faction are Moderates led by the traditional Conservatives like Thor Thors and Svien Bjornsson who feel the Socialists were obviously too left leaning, but the other factions are too nationalist. The second largest are the Constitutional Rule Faction, led by Bjorn Bjornson who also led the Nationalist militia during the Coup. They feel Iceland should be totally free from Copenhagen and draw closer to Germany for protection. The third faction is both the smallest and most radical. Led by writer Eldur S Kvaran and Wolf Helmuth Wolf-Rottkay they want Iceland to return to the Old Ways of the Vikingr. As the three factions gather and begin to discuss the future of the nation now hangs in the balance. After days of fiery debate a victory becomes clear and it is..."
ice.401.a: "The Traditional Conservatives!"
ice.401.b: "Bjornson and his Nationalists!"
ice.401.c: "Eldur and the Rightists!"

ice.402.t: "Keeping Course"
ice.402.d: "After much tense deliberation and arguments, the political weight of the Traditional Conservatives has won out. Arguing for a right of center democracy the Traditional Conservatives are the expected outcome. Bjorn’s Militarists have returned to their barracks and the Rightists remain even more marginalized than before. For the average Icelander this change of course will have little effect on them as the Conservatives have pledged to not rock the boat so much."
ice.402.a: "A return to form"

ice.403.t: "The Hallowed Thingvellir"
ice.403.d: "The Thingvellir is an area 25 miles north east of Reykjavik which had the unique distinction of being the place where the Icelandic Althing had been held from 930 until 1789 when it was moved to Reykjavik by the Danes. Since then it has been a tourism hotspot and a place of pilgrimage for nationalists. Now that we are free a motion has passed that the Thingvellir be restored and pressed back into service as the meeting place of the Althing. This move has been celebrated by most Icelanders, at least by those who cared in the first place, as a valued return to tradition." 
ice.403.a: "A nice change of pace"

ice.404.t: "Conquer your Fate" 
ice.404.d: "Today Bjorn Bjornson has declared himself the new President as the closing arguments in the Althing are read out. After weeks of tense deliberation Bjorn’s faction has emerged as the clear winner. The political ineptitude of the moderates and radicalism of the rightists seemingly left him the only real choice. In his first speech to the Althing Bjornson painted a picture of a strong and independent Iceland, bound to Germany not by force like Iceland was bound to Copenhagen, but by choice. Not only that but he has promised that all Icelanders will learn to love their country again and the new nation he pledges to build."
ice.404.a: "A nation with spine once more!"

ice.405.t: "The Position of the Lawspeaker"
ice.405.d: "As part of our reform of the Icelandic state we have been met with an interesting proposal of restoring the position of Lawspeaker. The position was traditionally said to have been founded along with the Althing itself back in 930. Its duties were to read the laws passed by the Althing and act as the Althings head, among others. However, when the Althing was abolished in 1800 the position was abolished as well and wasn’t reinstated when we regained independence. Now however we shall rectify that oversight. To occupy this most important of positions, some have suggested the current Chief of Police Agnar Kofod-Hansen, a strict disciplinarian and friend of the regime. Others have named influential Althing member and father of nationalist leader Björn Sveinsson Björnsson as a potential Lawspeaker. While some have expressed reservations about naming a new head of the highest office in the land, the offer is certainly attractive to the more orderly among our ranks. Ultimately the choice is ours, should we do it?"
ice.405.a: "The Althing refuses to appoint the Lawspeaker as Head of State."
ice.405.b: "The Althing elects Agnar Kofod-Hansen as Lawspeaker and Head of State."
ice.405.b: "The Althing elects Sveinn Björnsson as Lawspeaker and Head of State."

ice.406.t: "Free State Restored"
ice.406.d: "After much toil and work we have achieved our dreams! We fought off the radicals of the left and the right to form a nation of strong men, women and budding children. In the dozens of factories spreading across our island men work hard and work diligently knowing that every hour in the factory makes the nation that much stronger. At home the women work just as hard making sure their husbands come home from a long day to get what precious moments of relaxation a man can get. Meanwhile in the schools the factory workers and housewives of tomorrow are taught to be proud of themselves and proud of their nation and its history. We are a diamond in the rough, and it's time we watch it sparkle."
ice.406.a: "Öryggi og hefðir!"
ice.406.b: "The entire North Sea must know of our Glory!"

ice.407.t: "The Saga of Kvaran"
ice.407.d: "Through more the ineptitude of the other factions more than their own admittedly growing popularity, Eidur Kvaran and his Rightists have taken control of the Althing. In a fiery two hour and a half long speech, Eidur railed against the degenerate socialists for poisoning the minds of the workers, he railed against the moderate conservatives to bowing to business interests over their own country and he railed against the Nationalist Militarists for caring more about power than about restoring Icelandic pride. He then went off on a profusely long winded and, if reports are to be believed, profusely boring tangent about how modern society was just as poisonous as the Socialists and declaring Iceland was better off when sticking to the ‘Old Ways’. Without really clarifying what ‘Old Ways’ he was specifically referring to, he then marched triumphantly out of the Althing to total, stunned silence."
ice.407.a: "A Fire in the Cold"

ice.408.t: "Status of the 'Angoloids'"
ice.408.d: "When the Socialists held power they allowed British soldiers onto holy Iceland to ward off German pressure. These degenerate limeys then forced themselves onto the pure hearted Icelandic women and spawned many mongrel half-breeds. These half breeds have become a problem in our new nation. Some see them as a stain on the nation's honor, an entire race of degenerate Anglo sympathizers who will sell their own mother down the river for the benefit of Iceland’s enemies. They have come up with some rather... severe solutions to this problem. Others however point out that state sanctioned child killing makes them no better than the Socialists and instead point out that as kids, they are malleable. They instead suggest that a minor fine be levied on the parents for their miscegenation and put them into state run schools where they can be forged into model Icelandic citizens, part-Anglo or not."
ice.408.a: "Minor fines and try to raise the kids right"
ice.408.b: "Put them against the wall!"

ice.409.t: "Rise of the Icelandic Legion"
ice.409.d: "The Icelandic Army does not and has never existed. Instead we have the National Police, but they are no match for even a half baked militia. To an extent such a situation is understandable. Iceland had been far from any potential threats for its entire history, there was no need for an Army, much less a large one. However, times have changed. The First Weltkrieg showed just how generalized a ‘local’ war can become and the coming Second Weltkrieg promises to be even more severe than the first. Who's to say the damned Socialists won't try something while everybody is distracted? Not only that but a strong and large Army will be a pillar of pride for the nation as a whole!"
ice.409.a: "Forged from Cold Steel!"

ice.410.t: "Avenging Norway"
ice.410.d: "Norway has fallen far from its illustrious heights. Long forgotten are the hardy men the effeminate Western Europeans called Vikings. They are saturated with liberal decadence and Western degeneracy. They have strayed far from their ancestors and must be saved. The plan is audacious to be sure, requiring a naval landing across almost 1500km of sea. This has not been attempted by anybody in history, much less a nation such as us. However unlike the other nations of the world we have a long and storied tradition of seafaring. By channeling our Northmen blood and heritage we will master Aegir’s domain once more like our forefathers did so long ago."
ice.410.a: "Making History"

ice.411.t: "Conquering our Fate"
ice.411.d: "Despite challenges many deemed impossible we have achieved the impossible and achieved our goal of a model Nordic nation. We stand proud and strong, paying tribute to our illustrious past while also looking towards the future. With continued assistance from our friends in Berlin there is nothing that can stand between us and our ultimate Nordic utopia. To this end, our legions shall march forth, and bring the rest of Scandinavia into the fold!"
ice.411.a: "Styrkur og dýrð!"
ice.411.b: "No, we shall rest on our reclaimed land, and march no more."

ice.412.t: "The Land of the Ice and Snow"
ice.412.d: "Iceland is a unique nation, unlike any other in the world. No other nation can claim such a direct line of heritage to the past as ours. Our language remains much like it was thousands of years ago, our people live in lands many would consider inhospitable with little issue and Viking blood courses through our veins. In this land so distant from them, even in an era of such rapid communication, our lands still remain mysterious to most across the world. In the ancient tongue of the Romans we were known as the Thule, the farthest northern reaches of the world. The Romans and the Greeks saw our lands as nearly inhospitable and yet we remained. We shall demonstrate our strength for all the world to see and revel in their fear."
ice.412.a: "The White Wolf Wakes" 

ice.413.t: "The Þorrablót"
ice.413.d: "The Þorrablót is a traditional Icelandic midwinter feast with roots, like many of our festivals, dating back to time immemorial. As the Rightists and their ideals seep further into Icelandic society the blot, whose activities have long ago deviated from the wild parties, orgies and sacrifice of yore, once again have rumored to return to the Old Ways. While major cities have kept the blot, ‘civilized’ reports have begun to filter in from the countryside that in some instances these festivals have gotten out of control. Reports of parties and orgies lasting days and even animal and human sacrifice has shocked many, including those in Iceland. Some reports even said that the Government itself gathers for its own Þorrablót and they have had some political prisoners shipped in for their own human sacrifice and cultish rituals. These reports have been countered by the Government as nothing less than lies by the nation's enemies seeking to bring the nation down and instead insist that all reports of sacrifices to be about as fanciful as can be. Nevertheless many people named in said reports have been reshuffled to less public positions or even fired outright with little fanfare."
ice.413.a: "Praise Thor!"

ice.414.t: "Odin's Court"
ice.414.d: "In far away Austria in the early 1900s two men, Liebenfels and von List, realized a long standing fact covered up by the world and its puppet masters. This is the fact that the Aryan Europeans, those like us, were superior to all others. Before the corrupting institution of Christianity we ruled the world, we harnessed the fantastical forces of magic and the Sun and with our power none could stand against us. However after the False Christian ‘Gods’ took over the world, our magic and power waned until we were debased enough to be ruled over by the lesser beings. Our proud ancestors on the Continent have been entirely annihilated by the constant forced miscegenation with the beast-men. Here however, in perfect and pristine Iceland, our isolation has left us the last pure blooded Aryans on Earth, the last of an endangered super-race. Such beliefs were once in the extreme minority, held only by a few people. Now however, with our strength once again plain for all to see, more and more people are flocking to our cause. Everywhere people are now waking up to their long dormant power and flocking to our cause. Every new soul awakened is another vessel of power that strengthens all of us."
ice.414.a: "We shall strike down the beasts as Thor strikes the sky!"

ice.415.t: "Valhalla Calling"
ice.415.d: "As more and more people are drawn to our beliefs we have realized that outside the Party there is no real organization for them. While the Party is more than enough of a representative, it's not well suited to spreading the truth so much as protecting those who have already accepted it. To remedy this The Ásatrúarfélagið or Astartu Fellowship has been founded. It will act as a sort of social wing/outreach program for our beliefs. It will organize a youth wing, the Youth Fellowship, to instill a love for the lands we have been blessed with by the Gods through hiking, exercise and camping. Not only that but we could very obviously teach the truth to the young and malleable minds of the next generation and will believe them no matter what false facts the beastly European ‘scientists’ may claim. Already thousands have joined the Fellowship and many thousands more are waiting to join."
ice.415.a: "It's just a study group!"

ice.416.t: "The Saga of the Whites"
ice.416.d: "As our diligent historians pour over documents to prove our superiority over the rest of the world they have come across a collection of very interesting manuscripts. They date back centuries but describe Skraeling, or Native Americans to the degenerates, accounts of a land called Hvitramannaland or White People Land. The Skraeling said it was inhabited by white men with long poles, shouting war cries and wearing fringes. Now where this land is exactly is up to some serious debate. It’s not like those barbarians knew anything of maps, especially anything close to as accurate as the ones we have now. Reports are that it’s somewhere near old Vinland, modern day Newfoundland, or Markland, modern day Labrador. However, the very broad range of places this Hvítramannaland could be is rather convenient. The land was once Icelandic, and it shall be again, no matter where it is! We shall build a true Land for White People!"
ice.416.a: "Skin as white as snow, Hearts as cold as ice!"

ice.417.t: "To Prevent a 'Cod War'"
ice.417.d: "As Iceland begins to expand her fishing waters, it is becoming increasingly clear that such actions may lead to all out war. Why Canada or the Union of Britain would fight over nothing but fishing rights is something of a mystery, but perhaps such a war can be avoided. If Iceland were to fully bend to either Canada or Britain, there may be a chance to prevent war. To this effect, a group of seemingly other-worldly figures have gathered, and plan to push Iceland one way or the other, to prevent conflict of any kind. As the clock ticks, seemingly turning 10 times faster than an earthly clock, the group makes a decision and..."
ice.417.a: "...moves to push Iceland to embrace Syndicalism, under British tutelage."
ice.417.b: "...moves to push Iceland fully into Canada's Sphere"

ice.418.t: "Icelandic Statelessness"
ice.418.d: "Running from roughly 930 to 1262 C.E., the original Icelandic Free State, also called the Icelandic Commonwealth or the Þjóðveldið Ísland, had perhaps the most unique political system of its era. A common legal code was loosely established by cooperating chieftains, called goðar, and judicial disputes were settled in the Althing - the oldest still operating parliament in all of Europe. However, the Althing had no executive position or body, and as such, the original Icelandic Commonwealth is considered as a truly stateless society with ‘Anarcho-Capitalist’ facets to its bizarre economy, making it the closest thing the world has ever seen to a functioning Anarcho-Capitalist system - the dream of Anarchists and Anti-Statists the world over. However, unlike the fanciful and naive ideologies of these radicals, our stateless society not only worked, but prospered for centuries until we were subjugated by the Norwegians. With our renewed independence, the rise of the nationalist movement, and with our decision to rempower the Althing, Iceland once again shall slowly move to pursue this stateless dream once again. Modernized and adapted for contemporary realities, the reformed Althing will guide our people back towards the system that truly worked for us, proving to the world that statelessness can thrive if done right."
ice.418.a: "No gods, no masters?"
ice.418.b: "Let us embrace the modern stateless tradition fully!"
ice.418.c: "Embrace semi-statelessness in compromise with our nationalist modernizations." 
ice.418.e: "Embrace statelessness in tune with our ancestors' lifestyle."

ice.419.t: "Iceland’s First Domestic Meadery"
ice.419.d: "Despite our Viking roots, Iceland has no domestic meadery. We have our own breweries, but even they have been hit by hard times due to the prohibition laws passed in 1915. Luckily, as of the 1933 referendum, beer is once again legal in Iceland, though it must stay below an alcoholic content of 2.25%. However, other liquors and alcoholic beverages, including mead, do not have such a restriction, and as such, we have moved to create our first domestic meadery just outside Reykjavik in order to give our citizens something strong and traditional to drink, further linking them with our ancestral way. \n\nIn the past, all mead was imported to Iceland from Denmark and Norway, largely because mead’s main ingredient of honey has been nigh impossible to produce here on our island due to lack of local beekeepers and apiaries, as well as due to our harsh climate limiting the growth of the needed spices to flavor the brew. With modern technology though, we have been able to source our own hives and now are finally able to produce mead locally. By importing bees from the Federation of Irish Beekeepers' Associations and from famous father-son apiologists from New England John Harvey Lovell and Harvey Bullfinch Lovell, and by working with Ölgerðin Egils Skallagrímsson - the oldest brewery in Iceland, established in 1913 - we shall establish a local mead industry so that we may breathe life into our own economy while also filling the drinking horns and mugs of our citizens with the sweet amber ambrosia of our ancestors."
ice.419.a: "Too much ale, and a man’s heart is laid open for all to see."

ice.420.t: "A New Danelaw?"
ice.420.d: "Our raiding parties and viking hordes have seized the old area of the Danelaw, finally securing the British Isles within our grasp once again. Not since 954 have Nordic-blooded thanes and jarls ruled over this barbaric land, but we have finally righted this centuries-old wrong. Should we move to directly administer this land, or should we create a Danelaw client state along Icelandic cultural lines called Nýtt Íslensktlag, or New Icelandiclaw, under local collaborator and Nordicist William Brittain? If created, this new client-state would only administer the southern sliver of England, for the rest of the Isles are our rightful clay! Directly annexing the entirely of the land, including the vile hive of London, would likely cause mass unrest, so many urge us that it would be wise to create the client state, for the good of the realm, but of course, we are always free to do as we see best."
ice.420.a: "Create our own British dominion. So rises Nýtt Íslensktlag."
ice.420.b: "We will administer this land ourselves."

ice.421.t: "Revenge for Former Glories"
ice.421.d: "The old Viking raiding parties were incredibly successful, sailing across the Northern coasts of Europe and all throughout the North Sea and Scandinavia, out past Greenland and into the northern reaches of the New World, beyond the Mediterranean and into North Africa, and even out towards the Volga and the Caspian and Black Seas, or farther North towards Archengelsk. So far did they spread, that the Turks and the Barbary Pirates even came to our island seeking retribution in 1627 in a series of slave raids called the Turkish Abductions, or the Tyrkjaránið. With all this martial history and success behind us, and with our renewed Viking spirit and culture, we must decide how far our new raiding parties should go as we rebuild our vast sphere of influence once again."
ice.421.a: "Stick to the North Sea and its fringes."
ice.421.b: "Merely raid and pillage the Northern Coasts of Europe and Scandinavia."
ice.421.c: "The Northern Coasts of Europe and its Eastern fringes shall hear our war cries once again."
ice.421.e: "From Europe to North Africa, and from the Volga to Gibraltar, all former foes shall feel our wrath."

ice.422.t: "A New Raiding Fleet"
ice.422.d: "In order to reclaim our far-off lands across the sea, we are going to need a fleet to get there. No matter if we set sail for the New World or for Norway, we must have a new raiding party to carry us to the shores of our enemies, so we shall undergo a massive shipbuilding initiative in order to build the armada we need. From traditional long ships updated and refitted to compete with modern patrol boats and other small craft to cruisers and submarines of our own, we will build a fleet to rival the Great Powers themselves, for not even the raging maelstrom of the oceans keep us from our destiny."
ice.422.a: "We set sail into glory!"
