ENG_militia_idea: "Militias"
ENG_militia_idea_desc: "The British military is still largely organised in the impromptu worker's militias of 1925. While these local militias have a high morale, they seem disregardful for some of the finer concepts for warfare, such as the need for working logistics. Due to their deafening cries of 'Break the chains! Break the chains!', our officers routinely suffer from psychological breakdowns."
ENG_isolation_idea: "Splendid Isolation"
ENG_isolation_idea_desc: "While the Congregationists are the most vocal about it, all factions of British politics advocate at least some form of British isolationism. This may change over time, but for now it will make foreign involvement very hard."

ENG_england_army_mutiny: "Internal Collapse"

ENG_ministry_truth_idea_desc: "The Ministry of Truth is a government ministry in charge of enforcing loyalty to the Chairman. The mass destruction of reactionary literature, necessary falsicfication of historical events that tarnish the reputation of the revolution and production of news media, education and entertainment for the populace of Britain are all used to disuade reactionary thought and maintain devotion to the revolution."
ENG_cable_street_idea: "Memories of Cable Street"
ENG_cable_street_idea_desc: "The riots that took place on Cable Street showed the entire nation that not all are loyal to the Chairman, foolish defiance has led more to take up arms against Mosley. These pathetic attempts at rebelling will be crushed however the simple existance of struggle shows weakness in the Union. The memories of what took place at Cable Street now serve as a battle cry for those opposed to Maximism."

While to many this comes across as tyrannical, Mosley has been able to attract likeminded individuals to his cause and it seems to grow by the day, regardless a victory for Mosley and his Maximists would be a suprising and disturbing result.§!"
ENG_syndicalist_party: "Feds/Cons"
ENG_syndicalist_party_long: "Federationist/Congregationist wing of the TUC        §gWith the vote likely to be split between the various groups at the upcoming TUC election, the too most likeminded groups of the Federationists and Congregationists have banded together in an electoral pact with Arthur Horner as the main candidate and Annie Kenney as his running mate. The decision of who is to lead will likely be settled after the election.§!"
ENG_CON_syndicalist_party: "Congregationists"
ENG_CON_syndicalist_party_long: "Congregationist wing of the TUC                           §gThe Congregationalists are unique offshoot from the orthodox syndicalist movement that had arisen in France and Italy, promoting pacifism and pushing feminist causes as well as the general improvement of the status of women. To many working men this seems like an unnecessary goal and a distraction from the revolution but they appeal to women in a large number. It is unlikely the Congregationalists can take power on their own and they are likely to be propelled into a position through dealings with the larger Federationists§!"
ENG_FED_syndicalist_party: "Federationists"
ENG_FED_syndicalist_party_long: "Federationist wing of the TUC                    §gRepresenting the more standard and orthodox syndicalist views, the Federationists are noted for their support of the status quo with some minor reform. Focusing on an evolution of the system rather than radical upheaval they instead to steer a steady and untempered course through these stormy times. Representing the status quo it'd be suprising for the Federationists not to hold sway in the TUC.§!"

ENG_radical_socialist_party_long: "Autonomist wing of the TUC                     §gSyndicalism's focus on decentralisation would inevitablly lead to calls for more power to the Home Nations and with the Federationists only allocating power to local trade unions it was inevitable that special interest groups seeking to advocate for Scotland and Wales would form. Led by the famed Welsh poet and nationlist Niclas Y Glais, the Autonomists represent the most moderate but also more radical leanings within the TUC. Made up primarily of Scottish and Welsh nationalists they gain support elsewhere for their moderate and liberal views attracting those who would otherwise be disenfranchised in the new Syndicalist order.§!"

While noble in its aims, the small party was unable to have much impact in British political scene and saw mass defections both during the initial revolution and especially after with most of its former supporters finding a comfortable home in the Autonomists. While some TUC representatives swear allegiance to the now zombified party it has no central leadership or real clout.§!"

In the aftermath of the revolution, to suit the new realities the Liberals dropped the business friendly approach and fully adopted a progressive world view, gaining it some minor support in the TUC. It continues to be the only legal 'party' in the entire Union though it holds no sway in politics and is considered a non-entity by many. It's old leader David Lloyd George continues as its nominal chairman despite his retirement from politics and in reality he serves as more of a meaningless figurehead and personality rather than actual leader..§!"
ENG_market_liberal_party: "National Liberals"
ENG_market_liberal_party_long: "National Liberal Party                                            §gThe National Liberals are less of a party and more of a clique of likeminded individuals, mostly comprised of the ex-middle class and Liberal members who followed the Gladstonian tradition, finding no home in the new Liberal party. While the group have no real popular support and are effectively unable to ever take power as well as lacking in central leadership they represent the most cohesive reactionary opposition to the post-revolution Syndicalist order.§!"

ENG_social_conservative_party_long: "The Conservative Party                                         §gThe Conservative Party was officially disbanded following the revolution with centuries of support for the old order theoretically vanishing. The reality was much more stark, while much of the party's natural supporters and top officials escaped to Canada, it continues to linger on, mostly among supporters in the rural areas of the Union. While these small and disorganised 'Conservative Fraternities' as they are called are not illegal, syndicalist militas make a habit of harrassing their members and breaking up their meetings.§!"

Some generals and admirals stayed in Britain, refusing to stop fighting even as the Old Order collapsed. Wishing an end to the civil war, and seeing the chance to win a true officer core, a general pardon was offered. Many accepted, and pledged their services to the Union. While their service is desperately needed to makeup for the chronic lack of skilled military leadership among our direct supporters, their loyalty is constantly in question and they have made it implicitly known that they will not tolerate the government to overstep its boundaries, more specifically a Maxmist administration. For now though they continue to serve with a close eye on the government.§!"
ENG_paternal_autocrat_party: "Royalist Sympathizers"
ENG_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Royalist Sympathizers                                  §gMonarchism never truly died in Britain and while republicanism has firmly taken root in the minds of many British men and women, many would still accept and some even be glad for a return of the King. Among the most radical of these are groups that advocate for not only a return of the King in Canada but an extension of his powers. While only comprised of fringe groups allocated to the countryside, they continue to serve as an irritating nuisance to the Union.§!"

ENG_national_populist_party_long: "Assorted Nationalist Groups                              §gWhile the Autonomists represent the socialist side of nationalism in Scotland and Wales, on the other side of the coin is made up of more radical and openly reactionary groups such as the Homeland Watch and the Welsh Home Rule Army. Openly opposed to our regime, syndicalism and continued rule from London, these groups and other similar ones are not a cohesive body and so serve as little more than a thuggish nuisance. If things were to explode out of control however, they might just seize their chance to break away once and for all.§!"

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_ARTHUR_HORNER_DESC: "Born in the mining town of Merthyr Tydfil in Southern Wales, the young Arthur Horner was very much a working-class lad. As the eldest surviving son of seventeen children, of whom only six lived past infancy, his career began in the mines of Wales, and the idealistic young man came into contact with the mining unions of Southern Wales, becoming a member.\nHe would continue his low-level political activism in Welsh mining unions until the British Revolution of 1925, when the Monarchy was forced out and the Union of Britain was declared by the Trade Union Congress.\n\nDuring the Revolution, Horner was a key organiser of Miner's strikes in Wales and played a large role in guaranteeing the support of Miner's unions of Wales. After the death of the revolutionary leader John Maclean, Horner became involved in the emerging factionalism of the TUC, becoming an important leader of the status quo Federationist faction, favouring the Unions and the status quo established after the 1925 revolution.\n\nHorner's big moment came when Philip Snowden retired from the position of General Secretary of the TUC, and Horner captured and canvassed enough votes to become the new General Secretary of what is the vanguard of Syndicalism in Europe. Socialist Britain stands united under its General Secretary, for better and worse times to come!"
POLITICS_PHILIP_SNOWDEN_DESC: "The mild-mannered Viscount almost shouldn't have been the Chairman of the British Trade Union Congress, yet somehow he is, and he is well liked by the factions of what is a viciously factional body. Snowden's victory is largely credited to his decision to avoid the fractional politics of the Trade Union Congress and how he showed himself to be an unaligned and neutral candidate, free of partiality. Since his assuming of the title of Chairman, Snowden has seen old faces go and new faces come in the TUC, but he has always remained a symbol of British post-revolutionary unity, always calming factional tensions wherever they come, and seeking to maintain a balance between all four factions- which is perhaps why he unopposed Mosley's bid for Exchequer. The former Liberal-turned-Syndicalist is perhaps the most normal figure in these strange times, always staying above and refusing to occupy his time with petty insults. As the 1936 Congress of Trade Unions approaches, Snowden has given many hints to his possible retirement- an uncomfortable reality to say the least."
POLITICS_TRADE_UNION_CONGRESS_DESC: "Until the next year, the Trade Union Congress will have to work without a Chairman."
POLITICS_OSWALD_MOSLEY_DESC: "Oswald Mosley, left with a permanent limp from a flying accident during the Weltkrieg, entered into British politics a conservative. By the outbreak of the British Revolution, however, Mosley famously crossed the floor of parliament to stand with the revolutionaries of the Independent Labour Party.\n\nMosley, despite his physical impairment, quickly became perhaps the most passionate orator on the left. His firebrand speeches, particularly his famous address before the conservative workers of Birmingham, propelled Mosley to the forefront of the Trade Union movement, and eventually leadership of the governing TUC.\n\nMosley, founder of the authoritarian Maximist faction of the TUC, is a vocal exponent of increased centralisation, and aggressive foreign policy."
POLITICS_NICLAS_GLAIS_DESC: "Niclas Y Glais and the poetry, both in English and Welsh, he penned regarding the struggles of the working class, inspired many typically conservative rural laborers to embrace the British Revolution; his Welsh translation of the British anthem "The Red Flag" is sung by Welsh socialists of all stripes.\n\nDespite fierce opposition, Glais advocates both on the floor of the Trade Union Congress, and through his poetry, the devolution of power from the TUC to workers' assemblies in Wales and Scotland. The people of these regions, he argues, are both culturally different from that of England and currently politically underrepresented. With Glais as chairman of the Trade Union Congress, power is likely to be increasingly decentralised."
POLITICS_ANNIE_KENNEY_DESC: "Annie Kenney, imprisoned by the old regime of Britain for militant women's suffrage activism, convinced many of the working women of Britain to join the Trade Union movement in the prelude to the British Revolution. Her advocacy massively inflated support for the revolution, and subsequently pressured the new socialist government to grant political rights to women.\n\nOriginally run as candidate for TUC chair by the pacifist Congregationist faction in protest of the TUC's alleged failure to secure equality between men and women, through cooperation with the more orthodox Federationist faction, Kenney has become the first chairwoman of the TUC."
POLITICS_TOM_MANN_DESC: "Tom Mann, the famous first General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress, has been appointed as chairman of the TUC following electoral gridlock. Mann, though a Leninist, has shown great historical commitment to the Trade Union movement and a dedicated spirit of civil service. Mann, in his old age, however, has indicated that he does not intend to stand for re-election."
POLITICS_TE_LAWRENCE_DESC: "To some, Lawrence is a New Cromwell, hellbent on shaping England in his dictatorial image. To others, Lawrence is the protector of British Democracy, and the savoir of the nation. Many things can be said about Thomas Edward Lawrence, the famous officer and archaeologist who unsuccessfully led the Arab tribes in rebellion against the Ottoman Empire during the Weltkrieg. However, despite people’s views on him, one thing is a fact: His power over Britain is undeniable. Lawrence, charismatic yet reserved, has made ambiguous promises to the British people regarding Britain's future. While his past dedication to the Syndicalist cause is undeniable, many now fear that his power may go to his head; and he could end up being no better than the man he deposed. "
POLITICS_CLEM_ATTLEE_DESC: "Clem Attlee, shocked and disgusted by the poverty he witnessed while working at youth charity, became a prominent figure within the Independent Labour Party, and eventually the Trade Union movement. His activism, however, was cut short by the Weltkrieg.\nAttlee served on multiple fronts during war, and was eventually promoted to the rank of major. While Attlee's army service did instill in him a strong work ethic, it only entrenched his opposition to rigid hierarchy.\n\nAttlee, in British politics, is an ally, but not formal member of, the Autonomists."
POLITICS_BARBARA_CASTLE_DESC: "Barbara Castle, as a girl of only fifteen, led the children of her secondary girls' school in a rising in support of the British Revolution. The quirky red-haired girl quickly became a cultural icon throughout the newly established Union of Britain.\nAs she grew into a young woman, Castle again came into the public eye as the first female leader of the Oxford Students' Union, and never again left it. She became an increasingly vocal Congregationist, and eventually challenged the leadership of the admittedly magnanimous Annie Kenney.\n\nAs chairwoman of the TUC, Castle has vowed to fight the injustices that still plague the Union of Britain, especially inequities between men and women."
POLITICS_ERIC_BLAIR_DESC: "Eric Blair, the famous writer who helped propel his long-time ally Oswald Mosley to political prominence, came gradually to oppose Mosley. At every opportunity, Mosley seemed to tread upon the principles of the Union of Britain and the revolution which created it.\n\nBlair, with political triumph over his old friend, has vowed to restore to the people of Britain the freedoms Mosley so egregiously stripped from them."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_GALLACHER_DESC: "William Gallacher founded the Labour Withholding Committee in opposition to the Weltkrieg era Munitions Act. Jailed in his native Glasgow for undermining the war effort, Gallacher became increasingly radicalised. Upon release from prison, Gallacher joined the Glasgow Trades Council, part of the greater British Trade Union Movement, and organised it into an effective militia force during the revolution.\n\nGallacher, though initially opposed to Niclas y Glais's devolution efforts, has become satisfied with the current state of affairs."

ENG_anstice_plan: "Anstice's Plan"
ENG_anstice_plan_desc: "While many scoff at the notion that aircraft could ever serve as the backbone of a navy, Admiral Edmund Anstice asserts the necessity of controlling the skies over the sea. To do so, Anstice proposes that the role and number of aircraft carriers be greatly expanded."
ENG_dickens_plan: "Dickens' Plan"
ENG_dickens_plan_desc: "The Royal Navy was centred around the battleship and naval firepower. While Britain lost the Weltkrieg, its Navy held strong throughout the conflict. Since the revolution, naval strategy has advanced rapidly, and to many Republican naval officers, the Union of Britain must make a concerted effort to catch up to its rivals, rather than take a radical new approach to naval warfare."
ENG_merchant_marine: "Merchant Marine"
ENG_merchant_marine_desc: "The British Merchant Service was on the bleeding edge of civilian shipping administration. During the Weltkrieg, tactics developed by the Service to counter U-Boat raids kept Britain from terrible starvation. If our republic is to have any chance of surviving future conflicts, we must develop a robust Merchant Marine to both regulate shipping and conscript civilian ships for military service when needed."
ENG_expand_dockyards: "Expand Dockyards"
ENG_expand_dockyards_desc: "With a Merchant Marine service established and all union operated ships firmly integrated, our nation's ports are becoming increasingly congested. With the problem projected to only worsen, we must immediately expand the most clogged ports."
ENG_submarines: "Submarine Effort"
ENG_submarines_desc: "Per Admiral Cayley's direction, our presently quite small submarine fleet is due for expansion. Our current submarine designs, however, are inadequate. We must develop and deploy more advanced models."
ENG_destroyers: "Destroyer Effort"
ENG_destroyers_desc: "Our new fleet cannot operate entirely below the waves. To support out U-Boats, we need ships that are both versatile and agile, capable of dealing with those threats are U-Boats are unable to."
ENG_carrier_efforts: "Carrier Effort"
ENG_carrier_efforts_desc: "Aircraft Carriers have taken on a much greater role in naval combat, and Britain must change with the times. Our carrier fleet will be the centrepiece of the renewed British Navy."
ENG_naval_aviation: "Naval Aviation"
ENG_naval_aviation_desc: "Traditional aircraft designs are unable to fulfil the unique requirements of naval aviation. We must develop new aircraft designed be operated from carriers and other situations where runway space is at a premium."
ENG_battlecruisers: "Fast Battleship Effort"
ENG_battlecruisers_desc: "While lacking the armour of a Dreadnought, Fast Battleships are agile and pack a versatile suite of heavy guns. An evolution of the Battlecruisers of WW1 who served effectively during the Weltkrieg, an expansion of our Fast Battleship fleets is essential to the reconstruction of the British Navy."
ENG_battleships: "Dreadnought Effort"
ENG_battleships_desc: "Dreadnoughts are the kings of the sea, and were key to the global dominance of the British Royal Navy at the prior to the Weltkrieg. If we are to ever regain our naval strength, we must have new battleships."
ENG_republican_marines: "Republican Marines"
ENG_republican_marines_desc: "While naval power and the projection thereof are critical to military success, ships alone are unable to invade islands or assault coasts. Few Marine officers sided with the revolution in 1925, and as a result, the Republic's ability to conduct amphibious operations was stunted. If we are to having any hope of confronting our enemies across the seas, we must have a Marine department."
ENG_revolutionary_admiralty: "Revolutionary Admiralty"
ENG_revolutionary_admiralty_desc: "The Office of the Admiralty and Marine Affairs was the body responsible for the administration of the Royal Navy and served as a forum for communication between officers. The Republican Navy currently lacks any comparable office, with Naval affairs often tied-up in politics. Thus, we must establish an independent and thoroughly socialist Admiralty."
ENG_brittania_rules_the_waves: "Britannia Rules the Waves"
ENG_brittania_rules_the_waves_desc: "At last, the British Navy is beginning to look like its former self. If not already, soon enough, Britain will again rule the waves! Britons never will be slaves!"

ENG_republican_air_force: "Republican Air Force"
ENG_republican_air_force_desc: "Air power is critical for success on the modern battlefield. Currently, our air service is subordinate to our army, and while that assures democratisation, an independent Air Force would certainly be more effective. Thus, we must establish an Air Force both independent and socialist in character."
ENG_new_pilot_training: "New Pilot Training"
ENG_new_pilot_training_desc: "Pilot training in many nations, including our own, has been largely non-standard, and reliant on enthusiasts turned instructors. By consulting with prominent pilots, we can develop an effective training regimen."
ENG_flying_women: "Women's Flying Corps"
ENG_flying_women_desc: "Capable pilots are always in short supply, and the women of our nation, whose support was so crucial to the success of the revolution, yearn for the freedom of the skies. While it will certainly prove controversial, we have drafted a plan to create allow women to serve in the RAF in support roles to free up more men for combat."
ENG_aviation_unions: "Aviation Unions"
ENG_aviation_unions_desc: "Many syndicates around Britain operate small aerodromes for a variety of purposes. The larger of these facilities should be given state funding for expansion."
ENG_aviation_fuel_administration: "Aviation Fuel Administration"
ENG_aviation_fuel_administration_desc: "Without fuel, it does not matter how skilled our pilots are. It is likely that when war comes our fuel imports will be cut-off so we must work towards domestics sources of fuel; for the safety of the revolution we mustn't be depended on capitalist suppliers of oil. They can't be trusted."
ENG_air_observer_corps: "Air Observer Corps"
ENG_air_observer_corps_desc: "While London was terrorised throughout the Weltkrieg by German airships, relatively little damage was done by these raids. Since then however, the range and payload of aircraft has increased greatly. To counter the threat, we should create a volunteer organisation which looks vigilantly for enemy planes to forewarn our interceptor and anti-aircraft teams."
ENG_expand_air_unions: "Expand Air Unions"
ENG_expand_air_unions_desc: "Our programme of aerodrome enlargement was of great benefit to the expansion of the Republican Air Force, but proved to be a substantial administrative burden. With the air force now well-established, the Air Union programme can be expanded."

ENG_international: "Britain Within the International"
ENG_international_desc: "Britain's political factions advocate quite different foreign policy approaches. With the turbulent 1936 special session of the TUC at an end, Britain's place in the world, and especially its relationship with its socialist comrades of the Third Internationale, must be reassessed."
ENG_anglo_norwegian_cooperation: "Norwegian Comrades"
ENG_anglo_norwegian_cooperation_desc: "A more equitable Norway has arisen, and we will stand arm in arm with our socialist brethren there. The Norwegian and British people have much to offer each other, and as a gesture of our goodwill, we shall offer Norway generous economic assistance in exchange simply for future cooperation."
ENG_anglo_irish_friendship: "Anglo-Irish Friendship"
ENG_anglo_irish_friendship_desc: "With the light of socialism at last shining upon the Emerald Isle, the time for reconciliation between our historically closely linked peoples has come. Not only should we send diplomats and politicians to Dublin, but also representatives of the most successful British syndicates to help Ireland along the path of progress."
ENG_class_warfare: "Class Warfare"
ENG_class_warfare_desc: "War is upon us, and to preserve our great nation and secure our liberty, all working men must now unite for victory. We should promote the spirit of unity, self-sacrifice, and most of all, renewed class consciousness, to augment our war effort."
ENG_never_surrender: "We Shall Never Surrender"
ENG_never_surrender_desc: "As with any war effort, there are many detractors who advocate reconciliation with the enemy. To counter this sentiment, we should begin a propaganda campaign to promote the just nature of our war and the necessity of victory."
ENG_bletchley_park: "Bletchley Park"
ENG_bletchley_park_desc: "In the north of Buckinghamshire, a crack team of military intelligence researchers has emerged. Despite minimal funding, the Bletchley Park Electrician's Union, in coordination with our foreign intelligence service, has produced singular results. We should expand Bletchley Park's facilities and provide them with substantial state funding."
ENG_support_comrades: "Support Foreign Comrades"
ENG_support_comrades_desc: "If socialism is to survive, all socialist nations must thrive. It is our duty as socialists to assist the formerly downtrodden peoples around the globe who now valiantly their oppressors."
ENG_american_comrades: "American Comrades"
ENG_american_comrades_desc: "From America's manufacturing belt has come forth a redoubt of socialism. This new bastion of liberation, however, could easily be destroyed by the reactionaries it defies. We must assist the courageous workers of America any way that we can."
ENG_mexican_comrades: "Mexican Comrades"
ENG_mexican_comrades_desc: "The people of Mexico were among the first to cast off the chains of capitalist exploitation. Mexico remains, however, quite underdeveloped. We possess the means to help the Mexicans better their lot, and such assistance would surely foster closer ties between our nations."
ENG_further_cooperation: "Further Cooperation"
ENG_further_cooperation_desc: "We must do even more assist our North American allies. The relationship we are building there will surely be the start of something far greater."
ENG_mission_to_australasia: "Mission to Australasia"
ENG_mission_to_australasia_desc: "Socialism down-under is in dire straits. If our comrades are to fight capitalist tyranny successfully, they must have assistance."
ENG_australasian_comrades: "Australasian Comrades"
ENG_australasian_comrades_desc: "Now that socialism down-under has stabilised, we much give them what support we can to avoid them slipping back into their old ways."
ENG_indian_comrades: "Indian Comrades"
ENG_indian_comrades_desc: "Britain was once the oppressor of the Indian people. However, the strength of the relationship between our two peoples, regardless of the unfortunate circumstance in which it was built, is undeniable. Through economic assistance to Bharatiya Commune, we can begin to put right the injustices of history, and in the process, strengthen the socialist cause."
ENG_liberation_of_canada: "Liberation of Canada"
ENG_liberation_of_canada_desc: "Across the Atlantic Ocean in the frigid north, the devil himself seemingly lies in wait. Canada and its lackeys will surely strike us with even the smallest opportunity. We cannot wait to be attacked; we are as ready now to liberate the people of Canada as we ever will be."


ENG_tuc: "The 1936 Congress of the Trade Unions"
ENG_tuc_desc: "This year's TUC will probably be a bit special - long-time Chairman Philip Snowden has indicated that he intends to resign. The decentralisationist Autonomists, led by Niclas y Glais, centralisationist Maximists (Oswald Mosley) and status quo Federationists (Arthur Horner) with his egalitarian & pacifist running mate Annie Kenney are all vying for superiority. These will be nights to remember..."
ENG_tuc_economy: "Economic Policy"
ENG_tuc_economy_desc: "We must now consider the debate in the area of economics. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. Most people assume that the Maximists will win this debate, since Oswald Mosley is a major figure in the British economy these days."
ENG_tuc_internal: "Internal Policy"
ENG_tuc_internal_desc: "We must now consider the debate in the area of internal policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The outcome is unsure, since it is here the real decision for the future of the Union will be made."
ENG_tuc_military: "Military Affairs"
ENG_tuc_military_desc: "We must now consider the debate in the area of military affairs. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The debate is heated, since the last few days have only too clearly shown the deep rift within the TUC."
ENG_tuc_foreign: "Foreign Policy"
ENG_tuc_foreign_desc: "We must now consider the debate in the area of foreign policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The congress listened casually to every candidate until the suggestion of the Autonomists were heard, when a slow, shocked murmur ran through the hall."
ENG_central_industry_research: "Central Industry Research"
ENG_central_industry_research_desc: "To prepare our Syndicalist industry for the fight against the Capitalists, we should establish the Department for Central Industry Research. This office will help us overcome inefficiency."
ENG_local_help: "Local Help Initiative"
ENG_local_help_desc: "Many Comrades in the Union of Britain are still living in great poverty. The bureaucracy has done little to help them. If we extended our support of the local councils, these suffering people would finally feel the blessings of the revolution."
ENG_expand_industry_1: "Expand Industry: Wales and the Midlands"
ENG_expand_industry_1_desc: "The capitalist regime of old neglected Wales and the Midlands for centuries, and allowed, if not outright encouraged, the gradual depopulation of the region as its labourers migrated to England's southern cities for menial jobs. The great economic potential of these regions and its people thus remains largely untapped; for the benefit of all, we must invest!"
ENG_militarized_industry: "Militarised Industry"
ENG_militarized_industry_desc: "Only through relentless efficiency and discipline, even in the most mundane of tasks, will we be able to beat the capitalists."
ENG_expand_industry_2: "Expand Industry: Scotland"
ENG_expand_industry_2_desc: "Scotland to has been left behind, had its people neglected and its wealth stolen by the capitalist pigs. No more; today investment will flow north!"
ENG_british_rail_reform: "The British Rail Reform"
ENG_british_rail_reform_desc: "The British Rail Syndicate is in a horrid state. By investing into our infrastructure, we will assure flawless cooperation between Syndicates all over the island."
ENG_local_industry: "Local Industry Initiative"
ENG_local_industry_desc: "The Syndicalist economy does not only consist of steel factories but also of small non-centralised manufactures. By supporting these independent Syndicates, we will ensure versatile and flexible production."
ENG_local_talent: "Local Talent Initiative"
ENG_local_talent_desc: "We cannot afford to waste innovative talent just because it is not centred in the metropolitan areas. We need to support local talent."
ENG_local_initiative: "Expand Local Initiative"
ENG_local_initiative_desc: "While we have granted much power to the local communes, they continue to deal primarily with the central government. We should make reaching the central government harder so that our workers will work with each other for true socialist progress."
ENG_political_commissars: "Maximist Defence Force" 
ENG_political_commissars_desc: "The Union of Britain is a nation of freedom and liberty, the revolution has broken the chains holding workers back from expressing their beliefs. Despite this we must not allow ideologues to push anti-revolutionary rhetoric, the task of the Defence Force is to defend the revolution!"
ENG_defend_the_revolution: "Federationists: Defend the Revolution"
ENG_defend_the_revolution_desc: "The Revolution must be defended from the attacks from Autonomists and Maximists! The only way forward is the orthodox one!"
ENG_new_capital: "Move the TUC"
ENG_new_capital_desc: "London has long held a privileged place in Britain, and has become swamped by Centralism and bureaucracy; the TUC's current location reinforces this. Only by moving to a smaller city, one at the heart of Britain, and thus within reach of all its people, will we able to guarantee fair representation for all. This city will be Birmingham."
ENG_home_rule: "Home Rule"
ENG_home_rule_desc: "Syndicalism has to be achieved locally. Some offices, like tax enforcers - nobody likes those people anyway - can be moved to the home nation capitals of Cardiff and Edinburgh. They can prepare the establishment of local TUCs."
ENG_dissolve_tuc: "Dissolve the TUC"
ENG_dissolve_tuc_desc: "The Trade Union Congress has served its purpose. While it once represented the Syndicalist dream of true proletarian government, it now symbolises Centralist repression to many. With the success of our initial decentralisation efforts, the time has come to make the People's Palace the seat of a new, English TUC. The remains of the Union will be dealt with shortly."
ENG_devolution: "Devolution"
ENG_devolution_desc: "With the establishment of TUCs in Cardiff and Edinburgh, the process of Devolution will come to a successful end."
ENG_turn_the_other_cheek: "Compromise with Maximists"
ENG_turn_the_other_cheek_desc: "Actually, it seems that being under attack from both flanks is kind of nasty. Our chance of realising at least some of our visions is now. We cannot throw that chance away even if that may mean compromising with some more radical elements."
ENG_city_upon_a_hill: "Compromise with Autonomists"
ENG_city_upon_a_hill_desc: "Actually, it seems that being under attack from both flanks is kind of nasty. Our chance of realising at least some of our visions is now. We cannot throw that chance away even if that may mean compromising with some more radical elements."
ENG_evolution: "Evolution"
ENG_evolution_desc: "Both the Autonomists and the Maximists are trying to change an already working machine. British Syndicalism is fine as it is; If only they would understand that..."
ENG_merge: "The Grand Protector"
ENG_merge_desc: "While it is unconstitutional, unifying the offices of General Secretary and Chairman of the Trade Union Congress in the new office of Grand Protector of the Union of Britain will give us much more power to push through our reforms."
ENG_reform_militia: "Reform the Militias"
ENG_reform_militia_desc: "The Worker's Militias have been reformed into something a little more usable while the old democratic structures have been preserved. They still somewhat hinder military efficiency - but that we are able to tolerate. Break the Chains!"
ENG_dissolve_militias: "Dissolve the Militias"
ENG_dissolve_militias_desc: "The arms in the hands of the rabble have been tolerated for too long now. While our enemies hold on to these remains of a bygone age for some reason we know that only discipline is the way forward."
ENG_purge_militia_remains: "Adopt New Doctrines"
ENG_purge_militia_remains_desc: "Now that the military order has been changed, we need to optimise the organisation of logistics, messages and orders, all that small, boring stuff that wins wars."
ENG_revolution: "Revolution"
ENG_revolution_desc: "This whole 'reforming the country' business has turned out to be very boring. We can attempt one swift strike to totally seize the means of politics and make our political programme a reality. This will be risky, though."
ENG_central_command: "Central Command"
ENG_central_command_desc: "We need to establish a central Army Headquarters to optimise communication and cooperation between army units. This will allow for more grand-scale operations to be planned in an efficient manner."
ENG_improve_army: "A New Lee Enfield?"
ENG_improve_army_desc: "The rifles supplied by the factories formerly owned by Lee Enfield still constitute the overwhelming majority of our infantry weapons. However, at least according to gun connoisseurs, the weapons produced by the Birmingham Small Arms Factory have the reputation of being more suitable for offensive manoeuvres and change might be in order."
ENG_improve_army2: "Improve the Army: The Lewis M1936"
ENG_improve_army2_desc: "The equipment of the soldiers of the Revolution can never be perfect enough - time to improve upon our tried and tested design for a mainline machine gun!"
ENG_officer_corps_academy: "People's Officer Corps"
ENG_officer_corps_academy_desc: "Officers have a duty, and that is to be loyal to the revolution. By establishing a centralised People's Officer Corps and ending the terrible practice of military units voting for their own leaders, we can make sure they fulfil that duty."
ENG_red: "The R.E.D."
ENG_red_desc: "With the establishment of the Revolutionary Exportation Directory we will finally be able to conduct clandestine operations to help the workers around the world in their struggle against their oppressors!"
ENG_raf: "The Doctrine Dispute"
ENG_raf_desc: "For the last few months, disagreement has been brewing between the theorists of the Republican Air Force. They're unclear on how our countries air doctrine should develop, and it is affecting officer training by now. It is time to resolve these disputes!"
ENG_officer_corps_experience: "Vote for Officers"
ENG_officer_corps_experience_desc: "One of the central achievements of Syndicalism is the end of the tyrannical rule of the officers in our armed forces."
ENG_women_soldiers: "Women Soldiers"
ENG_women_soldiers_desc: "The equality of all comrades is necessary for the victory of the Revolution. It is unacceptable that, right now, some are 'more equal' than others."
ENG_three_armies: "Three Armies"
ENG_three_armies_desc: "Now that the home countries have at least partly gained their autonomy that same autonomy should go to the Worker's Militias. While we will initially have to help out with the establishment of new structures the new militaries should be able to stand on their own soon enough."
ENG_copenhagen_conference: "Copenhagen Conference"
ENG_copenhagen_conference_desc: "The uneasy peace between us and the exiled Royalists all around the world has lasted for too long. It is time to call a conference on neutral ground to determine a new status quo."

ENG_show_of_force: "Show of Force"
ENG_show_of_force_desc: "With the newest aircraft carrier RNS Rebecca fully operational the Republican Navy was ready to reclaim her rightful position among the mightiest navies of the world. However, the target of her first action is heavily disputed."
ENG_third_international: "The Third International"
ENG_third_international_desc: "France has gone through with its designs to hold the First congress of the Third International and we, as expected, have received an invitation. It would be foolish not to send a delegation."

ENG_go_with_france_desc: "The Internationale shall be a political and military Union from now on. We cannot afford to fall divided."
ENG_military_interventions: "Military Interventions"
ENG_military_interventions_desc: "All around the globe brave men and women are fighting for the Syndicalist dream. We cannot let such silly things as international customs hold us back in our struggle for progress. Once we signal to the world that we are ready to bring the fight to every shore Syndicalist countries in civil war will be able to ask for our help."
ENG_class_war: "Class War"
ENG_class_war_desc: "So comrades, come rally,\nand the last fight let us face!\nThe Internationale Unites the human race!\nNow is the time to bring forth a Syndicalist world. All else shall stand behind this highest goal!"

ENG_military_industry: "Military Industry: Southern England"
ENG_military_industry_desc: "While the south hasn't been neglected to the same degree as other regions, its workers will still under invested in. By investing in the area and expanding the talent of the great syndicalist workers there will be able to grow military industry rapidly."
ENG_military_industry2: "Military Industry: Northern England"
ENG_military_industry2_desc: "It is time to make the North of England a great 'Northern Powerhouse'! With enough investment it will soon be creating arms to support those fighting for workers the world over."
ENG_conscript_vessels: "Conscript Vessels"
ENG_conscript_vessels_desc: "The fishermen do not dare to go out to sea, so we may as well make their vessels serve as their protection. They may even get them back once the war is won."
ENG_naval_dockyards: "Organised Dockyards"
ENG_naval_dockyards_desc: "The current disorganised state of the Dockyards administered by the smaller Syndicates is unacceptable. Some centralisation will have to happen or else we will lose the war at sea."

ENG_total_mobilization: "Total Mobilisation"
ENG_total_mobilization_desc: "Every person in Britain will have to work for the Union. Every second of work for the Union will have to serve the war effort. Every second of the war effort will have to serve the final and absolute defeat of Capitalism."

ENG_small_boat_research: "Escorts for RNS Rebecca"
ENG_small_boat_research_desc: "Even the biggest Aircraft carrier is worthless without screens to accompany it. Now that the RNS Rebecca, the pride of our fleet, is finally completed, we should invest into research in the areas of improved Destroyer & Cruiser Hulls, which will lead to better, faster, and all around more capable task forces."
ENG_navy_doctrine: "Reform Whitehall"
ENG_navy_doctrine_desc: "While the Admiralty of the Republican Navy still sits in Whitehall, where the British Navy had its headquarters for centuries, the brain drain following the revolution hasn't been completely overcome. And sadly...it's showing."
ENG_big_boat_research: "Battlecruiser & Battleship Research"
ENG_big_boat_research_desc: "The Republican Navy has put a lot of effort and resources into the RNS Rebecca - but it's really not the right path. Battleships may have the most firepower, but the ongoing improvements in aircraft technology has lead us to believe mobility may win the wars of tomorrow."
ENG_tank_research: "Tank Research"
ENG_tank_research_desc: "Innovations in Tank Design will make our forces both more manoeuvrable as well as more durable. What's not to love?"
ENG_anti_tank_research: "Anti-Tank & Anti-Air Research"
ENG_anti_tank_research_desc: "Focus on Anti-Tank and Anti-Air research. Good Anti-Tank equipment is absolutely necessary for every capable infantry unit and even Anti-Air, while often underrated, may at one point get patched by Paradox."
ENG_fighter_research: "Fighter Research"
ENG_fighter_research_desc: "The enemy may focus on bomber research - but what good are improved payloads if they only hit the ground together with their burning bomber?"
ENG_air_doctrine: "Air Doctrine Research"
ENG_air_doctrine_desc: "The ways in which air warfare has changed in this conflict have been astounding for all sides. Only by innovative adaption will we be able to hold the upper hand in the air."
ENG_bomber_research: "Light Bomber Research"
ENG_bomber_research_desc: "While control of the skies is essential, what good is an air force if it does not assist the men on the ground? Light bombers, both specialized for direct support and destruction of hard targets, will allow our troops to fight that much more effectively."
ENG_motorised: "Motorised Research"
ENG_motorised_desc: "While tanks are good and all somehow it seems they become even more useful when the infantry can actually keep up with them. Maybe we should investigate this circumstance."
ENG_float_boat_research: "Carrier Research"
ENG_float_boat_research_desc: "The Republican Navy has put a lot of effort and resources into the RNS Rebecca - Building on that accumulated expertise and further expanding our carrier fleet would be the next logical step."
ENG_sub_research: "U-Boat Research Programme"
ENG_sub_research_desc: "According to the strategies employed by the German Kaiserliche Marine during the Weltkrieg, U-Boats are to be used as escorts for fleets of Main Battleships. This was proved successful during the later days of the war - we should continue accordingly."

ENG_mission_to_norway: "Mission to Norway"
ENG_mission_to_norway_desc: "Norway is rife for Syndicalism. We could send a team of politically experienced advisers and leaders to the Norwegian Syndicalist Party, bringing pressure on the capitalists and supporting the Syndicalists."
ENG_invite_norway: "Invite Norway"
ENG_invite_norway_desc: "Now that Norway is Syndicalist, we should offer to extend the friendship of the International to them."
ENG_air1: "Controlling the Skies"
ENG_air1_desc: "For thousands of years, Britain could rely on the Sea to keep it safe from any invaders. For the first time we have to confront the real possibility of an airborne invasion. But we can rely on a doctrine well-tested: simply build as many as the next two together. More Fighters! More Bombers!"
ENG_air21: "Controlling the Battlefield"
ENG_air21_desc: "While the battle in the air is important, we still need boots on the ground to win the war. We should set our industrial capacities accordingly."

ENG_show_of_force_dip: "Words"

ENG_show_of_force_mil: "War"
ENG_show_of_force_mil_desc: "The Irish worker, much like the English worker, has suffered enough. Revolution has not yet, however, engulfed Ireland, and so war is needed to resolve the current Irish situation!"

ENG_tuc2_demobilization_desc: "Fighting the war was hard; Living peace will be even harder. A programme to ensure a regulated turn to peace production is in order."
ENG_tuc2_internal: "Cut Out Red Tape"

### 0 - 100: TUC and Show of Force ###
uob.0.t: "The New Britain"
uob.0.d: "After the defeat of France, the United Kingdom's war with Germany dragged on inconclusively for two years. In 1921, the stalemate was finally broken when Lloyd-George agreed to the German proposal of a "Peace with Honour". While Britain's overseas territories remained largely intact, the faith of the people did not.\n\nIn 1925, disaster struck: a minor labour dispute in the coalfields of South Wales quickly escalated, and after six weeks of rioting, looting and pamphleteering, most of the "establishment", including the Royal Family, had fled to Canada. A provisional government of revolutionary groups dissolved what little was left of Parliament, and declared a new "Union of Britain".\n\nEleven years later, the Trade Union Congress still forms the centrepiece of politics of the federated and democratic Union. The British people are secure on their island, content to build socialism in isolation, protected by the strong Republican Air Force and Navy, and with each county protected by its own popular militia who act both as a reserve military and the new police.\n\nYet, with the world seemingly ready to erupt into chaos, many are starting to wonder if Britain has a duty to spread the revolution to her former colonial territories. After all, the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union indefinitely..."
uob.0.a: "Fascinating."

uob.1.t: "The 1936 Trade Union Council Begins"
uob.1.d: "After weeks of preliminary meetings and preparation, today the main part of the Trade Union Congress of 1936 has begun. The various factions of the congress have sent their delegates and their leaders to London to argue for their position. We shall see what shall happen."
uob.1.a: "Let the Congress Begin!"

uob.2.t: "Economic Policy Vote"
uob.2.d: "The debate has wandered into the area of economics. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. Most people assume that the Maximists will win this debate, since Oswald Mosley is a major figure in the British economy these days."
uob.2.a: "Max.: The economy must be expanded, centralised and streamlined."
uob.2.b: "Fed.: The economy must be expanded and centralised."
uob.2.c: "Aut.: Greater economic autonomy must be given to the Home Nations."

uob.3.t: "Internal Policy Vote"
uob.3.d: "The debate has wandered into the area of internal policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The outcome is unsure, since it is here the real decision for the future of the Union will be made."
uob.3.a: "Max.: The local governments must be brought in line with the TUC."
uob.3.b: "Fed.: The current system is satisfactory."
uob.3.c: "Aut.: Decentralisation - perhaps even local TUC's for the Home Nations."

uob.4.t: "Foreign Policy Vote"

uob.5.a: "Max.: The military must be expanded and the local militias placed under TUC control."
uob.5.b: "Fed.: The army must be expanded but only in self-defence."
uob.5.c: "Aut.: A Scottish, English, and Welsh national army."

uob.6.t: "The Resignation of Philip Snowden"
uob.6.d: "On the last day of the TUC congress Chairman Philip Snowden climbed up to the podium and made a speech. He claimed that in face of massive rifts within the TUC and due to his age he intends to resign his post. He also pulled out the cliche 'time with the family' bit that all politicians do. The congregation stood silent as he climbed down from the podium and made his way out of the hall. The country is shocked and in a few days' time the TUC will have to vote on a new chairman."
uob.6.a: "Shocking, to say the least."

uob.7.t: "Chairman Election - Maximists Secure a Majority"

uob.15.t: "Show of Force"
uob.15.d: "With the newest aircraft carrier RNS Rebecca fully operational the Republican Navy was ready to reclaim her rightful position among the mightiest navies of the world. However the target of her first action was heavily disputed. Most officers opted for a full scale naval manoeuvre near Ireland or even further west wards - near the Azores or Iceland. But a naval manoeuvre of such large scale would surely draw attention of the much more powerful and heavily armed Hochseeflotte and even the smaller Canadian Royal navy might be forced to organise countermeasures. Most members of the Congress of Trade Unions opted for a small scale manoeuvre possibly without even leaving British territorial waters. Ultimately the Naval Commissar was inclined in favour for the Irish option."
uob.15.a: "Keep the fleet in our territorial waters."
uob.15.b: "Send the Grand Fleet towards Ireland."
uob.15.c: "Divide the fleet and perform manoeuvres near the Azores and Iceland."

uob.16.t: "British Fleet Manoeuvres"
uob.16.d: "The British navy has steamed out of its ports and has assembled to demonstrate its power against our neutral island. In face of this grave situation many politicians suggest that Ireland should find someone to guarantee its independence. The most reasonable option would be Germany - but there are even some advocating a return to Windsor protection."
uob.16.d.return: "[refuse_country.GetNameDefCap] has abandoned us, and refuses to do anything about our predicament. What shall we do now?"
uob.16.a: "Maintain our neutrality"
uob.16.b: "Ask the Kaiser for protection"
uob.16.c: "Ask the Canadian king for protection"

uob.17.t: "Ireland Requests Canadian Support"
uob.17.d: "The Irish have asked for our support in face of Socialist violations of their neutrality. This gives us an opportunity to recover a part of our sphere of influence and undermine the socialist activities in the region."
uob.17.a: "Proclaim that Ireland is protected by the Entente."
uob.17.b: "Announce our support for Ireland."
uob.17.c: "We are not ready for such involvement in the Old World."

uob.18.t: "Canada Protects Ireland"
uob.18.d: "The Canadian government has proposed to offer the Irish military and diplomatic support against the Union of Britain. Even though there are still many circles fearing the potential rise of Windsor influence this is clearly a step towards Irish security."
uob.18.a: "Most splendid!"
uob.18.b: "Bloody hell!"

uob.19.t: "Canada Supports Ireland"
uob.19.d: "The Canadian government has offered full diplomatic support against the Union of Britain. While it is an important political gesture it has little true value as the Canadians are rather unlikely to directly intervene in any potential conflict. Still, Britain is widely expected to ease their policy towards Ireland until the diplomatic climate changes."
uob.19.a: "At least we're not alone..."
uob.19.b: "It may actually be quite wise to do so..."

uob.20.t: "Canada Abandons Ireland"
uob.20.d: "The Canadian government has ignored the Irish call for help. Whatever comes next, they must be prepared for the worst, as this gives the British a free hand in choosing their next step towards the Emerald Isle."

uob.21.b: "Announce our support for Ireland."
uob.21.c: "We are not ready for such involvement."

uob.22.t: "Germany Protects Ireland"
uob.22.d: "The German government has proposed to offer the Irish military and diplomatic support against the Union. Even though there are still many circles fearing the potential rise of Hohenzollern influence this is clearly a step towards Irish security."

uob.25.t: "Union of Britain Threatens Iceland and the Azores"
uob.25.d: "The socialist navy has left its naval base in Liverpool and is heading towards Iceland and the Azores. Although this move seems to be just a show of force it should not be ignored. This is not a direct threat towards the Entente but many officials believe that leaving it unattended is not a wise choice. A most appropriate answer would be to send out the Royal Navy but this is opposed by many Canadians who prefer further preparations before decisive action against the Union is taken."
uob.25.a: "Demonstrate our own power."
uob.25.b: "Spend our resources on further buildup."

uob.26.t: "The Royal Navy on the Atlantic"
uob.26.d: "The King has ordered the Royal Navy to enter the Atlantic in a show of force roughly matching ours. Although the Entente is far too weak for another war we should keep this act in mind should we attempt another demonstration."
uob.26.a: "Bloody hell!"
uob.26.b: "Merde!"

uob.27.t: "The Canadians Cower"
uob.27.d: "The Canadians did not dare to send their fleet into the Atlantic allowing our force to operate freely. This has shown the power of socialism and weakness of the Imperialist 'great powers'."

uob.28.d: "The socialist navy has left its naval base in Liverpool and is heading towards Iceland and the Azores. Although this move seems to be just a show of force it should not be ignored.

uob.30.t: "The Germans Cower"

uob.31.t: "Union of Britain Attacks Ireland"
uob.31.d: "The Union of Britain has declared war on Ireland. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the Internationale, and the Irish government has asked for our help.

uob.31.b: "Back down! We've changed our minds!"

uob.32.d: "The Royalists in Canada have sent an ultimatum to London. We are to either make peace with Ireland and declare a ceasefire or Canada will come to Ireland's aid. Though it is certainly in our interests to seize the island and secure our vulnerable flank in the event of future conflict, calling their bluff may prove to be extremely risky."
uob.32.a: "We will not risk war with Canada over this."
uob.32.b: "We answer to no monarchy! Continue on to Dublin!"

uob.33.t: "Britain Ignores Our Ireland Ultimatum"

uob.43.d: "The Union of Britain, those despicable usurpers, has declared war on the Irish state. So far we have only given diplomatic support to Ireland and do not have to intervene. We could still bring our forces into action - but after our lenient policy so far such a reaction would most likely raise protests here among those who support the Ulster cause and see the Irish Republicans as traitors to the Empire."

uob.217.b: "Wonderful!"

uob.218.t: "Maximist Revolution"
uob.218.d: "Yesterday British Republican Army units arrested many prominent leaders of the opposition against the government lead by Oswald Mosley.

uob.219.t: "Maximist Revolution"

uob.220.d: "Yesterday British Republican Army units tried to arrest many prominent leaders of the opposition against the government lead by Oswald Mosley.

This day will leave a clear mark on Maximist prestige."

uob.221.d: "Yesterday the British Republican Army marched out of its barracks and into the streets of the Union securing important buildings and installations against an unnamed counter-revolutionary threat after martial law had been declared by the Chairman.

uob.222.d: "Yesterday the British Republican Army marched out of its barracks and into the streets of the Union securing important buildings and installations against an unnamed counter-revolutionary threat after martial law had been declared by the Chairman.

The number of casualties is as-of-yet unknown, but the Maximists pass emergency law after emergency law in order to contain the situation; The Union of Britain has been transformed into a Maximist country."

uob.224.d: "This morning the British Republican Army marched out of its barracks and into the streets of the Union securing important buildings and installations against an unnamed counter-revolutionary threat.

uob.225.d: "After we called for a nation-wide General Strike to resist the unlawful coup the streets of the Union soon filled with workers carrying banners and singing syndicalist songs peacefully protesting for Syndicalism.

uob.225.a: "The Union is saved!"

uob.226.t: "General Strike Continues"
uob.226.d: "The workers are following our call for protest. The soldiers proceed to seize important buildings - but they seem increasingly insecure. If we proclaim that we will not punish today's traitors they may be willing to give up."

After a hail of machine gun fire only bodies are left on the British streets."

uob.228.d: "After we called for our soldiers to protect the Syndicalist order and not obey the orders of their officers many soon remembered the traditions of the old, disbanded, worker's militias. They formed Soldier Councils and decided to stand down. The scare is over."
uob.228.a: "The Union is saved!"

uob.229.t: "Republican Forces Stand Idle"
uob.229.d: "The soldiers sitting on their tanks and guarding public squares seem to be not doing anything. For whatever reason, the hours pass, and nothing happens. The people peering out of their windows are waiting..."

uob.230.t: "Republican Forces Side With the Maximists"

uob.230.a: "We have failed."

uob.231.t: "Mending the Wounds"
uob.231.d: "The coup has been averted peacefully, but it should never have happened in the first place. In the aftermath, the people have been left wondering what could make them turn against their own countrymen. The general spirit among the populace, however, is one of reconciliation, as we once again stand together as a true Union of Britain."
uob.231.a: "We must forgive, but not forget."

uob.232.t: "A New Course for the Union"
uob.232.d: "The coup was successful, but has left some serious rifts in our national identity. It will take time to convince the people of our new way for Britain."

uob.361.t: "A Cold, Wet Day for Eric Blair"
uob.361.d: "Comrade Eric Blair, once an ally of Grand Protector Mosley, cannot stand it any longer. For too long the evil Mosley had perverted the constitution and made the Union of Britain his plaything. A popular writer and skilled militia commander, Blair alone has the authority to bring down the tyrant. As Blair stared out into the rain today, he knew he had to take action."
uob.361.a: "His Populist coup is successful!"
uob.361.b: "He brings in the military!"

While officially no testament has been found, it is an open secret that Blair was no longer an ally of Grand Protector Mosley.\n\nAs the 'improvised' demonstration in his honour slowly and quietly travelled through the streets of London, ever more people joined, many with tears in their eyes. Some wept for the man, some for the last hope against Mosley's dictatorship."
uob.362.a: "Finally he's gone..."

uob.363.t: "The Oil Question"
uob.363.d: "It has been decades since we forced the capitalists out, yet we can't rest. Not until they are all defeated will we be safe, but to defeat them the workers spirit will not be enough. There are no two ways about it; without oil our planes, tanks and ships are nothing but scrap, no matter the skill of their crew.\n\nSince we first realised the issue, monumental effort has been spent attempting to cultivate domestic sources of oil. Some, like the shale oils in Scotland, have seen mild success. Others, like the French oil fields, have been near total failures. Fortunately, many saw this coming, and so resources had already been put towards researching synthetic sources of oil. If we divert enough resources in this direction, it may just be possible..."

uob.364.t: "Support from the Union of Britain"
uob.364.d: "Today an envoy from the Union of Britain arrived.

And in fact, he already had a project in mind when our scientists asked what kind of research we could assist and support him in. It all seems very technical, and, more importantly, hideously expensive, but our experts assure us that this Turing might be on the right path to something extraordinary..."

For the first time, military encryption and decryption are conducted by a machine. This will give the Union an important edge in any military conflict."

uobflavour.23.d: "Oswald Mosley of the Union of Britain has invited the leader of the Sorelians, Georges Valois, to Birmingham to discuss the common ground between their ideologies. Valois has thanked him for the invite and set off in the name of internationalism, bringing with him as guests the Hungarian exiles Tibor Szamuely and Mátyás Rákosi, whose views are also very much in line with Mosley's and Mussolini's."

uobflavour.24.d: "Oswald Mosley of the Union of Britain has called a meeting between his French and Italian counterparts to discuss similarities in their shared ideology.

uobflavour.26.t: "The Union of Arts"
uobflavour.26.d: "For a few years now, a group of artists led by a German emigrant by the name of Hannes Meyer have pushed for their idea of a unified Union of Arts. They argue that 'all arts need to be brought together to create an actual, total work of art, a Gesamtkunstwerk.' Needless to say, many of the proposers have adapted this view of the arts onto their political life, where they stand for Maximist views. They have also made themselves quite popular with drafts for Unionised Living Space for poorer comrades.\n\nThe artistic world of the Union is divided as sculptors, potters and writers deny having to do anything with those architects, and a clear path must be set. Should we establish one Union for all our artists, or leave things as they are?"
uobflavour.26.a: "The way forward is together!"
uobflavour.26.b: "We don't need centralisation for centralisation's sake..."

uobflavour.27.t: "Rebuilding the Crystal Palace"
uobflavour.27.d: "Built as a display hall for the Great Exhibition of 1844, the Crystal Palace was a cast-iron and plate-glass marvel of the old British Empire. During the Weltkrieg, it was transformed into the Royal Navy training station HMS Victory VI. As a result, it became one of the last holdouts of royalists in London, and was destroyed by fire during the Revolution. The gutted skeleton of the building has been left to rot over the last ten years as London worked on its industry and defences. A proposal has been put forward to rebuild the Crystal Palace as an exhibition hall where the men and women of the International will display their industrial and cultural products as equals, not as imperial trophies. However, it would be an expensive undertaking to get it ready in time for next year, and a large part of the Congress advocates simply tearing the ruins down and expanding the surrounding parkland."

uobflavour.34.d: "After the recent developments in Ireland the British ambassador in Dublin has invited his German counterpart and his attachés for a dinner party to finally alleviate the tension - or at least that's what the German delegation thought. Instead, they found themselves in a Dublin gin joint being served grumpy stew. As they finally left the embarrassing meeting they had to parade through a street filled with Irish socialists cheering on the British delegation. With this spiteful parting gesture however the British campaign against Ireland seems to have come to an end."

uob.500.t: "St David’s Day Arsonists"
uob.500.d: "Early on the morning of March 1st a group of men set ablaze a militia training school on the Llyn Peninsula near Penyberth. The men were able to escape despite attempts by the local milita to apprehend them. In the post this morning the Daily Worker received correspondence from the dissident Welsh republican organisation ‘Byddin Ymreolwyr Cymru’ or The Wales Home Rule Army claiming responsibility for the attack. They went further to state that similar attacks would take place until Wales was given its independence from English rule. The organisation has been in active opposition to the government in Westminster since 1925 and due to a lack of industrialisation in the North of Wales very little has been done to integrate the republican heartlands into the wider Union of Britain. Only time will tell if more attacks are to come. While the Federationists and Maximists have been quick to condemn the arsonists, Y Glais and the Autononomists have called for a softer hand in catching the arsonists."
uob.500.a: "Bloody Welsh!"

uob.501.t: "Homeland Watch Attacks"
uob.501.d: "It seems that the arson attacks by the WHRA has inspired their Scottish counterparts to launch a copycat arson in Scotland, albeit much more daring. Attacking a highland militia base in the dead of night they were able to catch most of the men off guard, seize the contents of the armoury and make off into the night setting fire to the base in the process. While the arson attack in Wales was a bloody nose to the Federationist authority, this has been a direct challenge and panic is spreading now that the fringe and obscure Homeland Watch organization has managed to gain arms likely to be used in future terrorist attacks. As the Federationist leaders call for calm, many wonder if they can truly protect the people and the revolution."
uob.501.a: "Hunt those bastards down!"

uob.502.t: "Raids On The Opposition Offices"
uob.502.d: "As expected, troops loyal to the Maximist cause raided several offices around London that harbored members of opposition parties. Several high-ranking Autonomists and Congregationalists have been captured and taken into custody for questioning with rumours swirling that some prominent Federationists have been executed already. Upon raiding the Welsh Office however, it was found that Niclas Y Glais had fled with important party documents. It is rumoured that there may be informants within the Maximist government who gave Y Glais warning of the raid and he himself has tipped off fellow syndicalists in Cardiff and Edinburgh. Roads leaving London have been closed but Y Glais is yet to be found."
uob.502.a: "I want his head on my desk!"

uob.503.t: "Somethings Not Right..."
uob.503.d: "Despite a media blackout and attempts to suppress any and all information leaving London, it seems news of what has taken place has spread like wildfire with militias across the country disolving and disappearing into the night. Prominent totalists in Scotland are being assassinated and all word from Wales has been completely cut off. Whispers of a coup and counter-revolutions are spreading and many wonder if Mosley's position as chairman is in crisis..."
uob.503.a: "Nothing to see here citizen!"

uob.504.t: "The Army Mutinies!"
uob.504.d: "With the situation rapidly unfolding elements of the British army have mutinied en masse, disolving themselves, leaving only a few loyalist remnants. While the Maximists try to make out this was in fact a well planned purge of the armed forces and they intend to rebuild from scratch many in the inner circle are watching the coming days with fear. All communications to Wales have been cutoff and allegations that loyal military units there are being murdered in the night by the WHRA remain unsubstantiated. In Scotland the news is much more bleak and it seems the Homeland Watch have assumed full control of the nation from within the shadows with Maximist sympathizers being gunned down in the streets. John MacCormick has came forward as its leader and called on all Scots to resist Mosleyite tyranny. While a death warrant has been issued for MacCormick there is one too enforce it and our loyalist military elements struggle to cross the border into Scotland."
uob.504.a: "Is this the end of Maximism?"

uob.505.t: "Scotland Breaks Off!"
uob.505.d: "It seems that the inevitable has come to bear and John MacCormick has officially signed off a Unilateral Declaration of Independence to much fanfare though this is more of a formality with the Homeland Watch more or less controlling the nation. A state of open warfare exists between this Scottish Republic and the Union of Britain with our enemies are flocking to recognize the new nation there are rumours that MacCormick's authority is contested by the missing Willie Gallacher and an alternative socialist government. While lacking support, if it manages to oust MacCormick it could appeal to France. Regardless we'll have to wipe out this government now before it can cause too much damage."
uob.505.a: "Scotland Forever!"
uob.505.b: "Britain can never be divided!"

uob.506.t: "Wales Breaks Off Too!"
uob.506.d: "Communication channels have finally been reopened with Wales and it seems that the local totalists there have turned on us and given allegience to a resurgent Y Glais and his rebel government Cardiff. Suprisingly in the official announcement of their own UDI, Saunders Lewis, head of the WHRA, was present and admitted a begrudging respect for Y Glais' committment to Welsh autonomy. It appears the two men have put aside their differences and Lewis has pledged allegience to Y Glais' Welsh United Front. While Wales lacks foreign benefactors or even recognition, with the entire Welsh political scene allied against us, they could be a stubborn foe."

uob.507.t: "Refugees Fleed The Country!"
uob.507.d: "With our reforms in full swing and both Wales and Scotland having broke away, refugees fleeing the war on the border, political oppression from Mosley's reforms or just simply native Scots and Welsh returning to fight for their homeland, many men and women are fleeing the territories we still control with a disturbing amount pledging their allegiance to the new nations. For now there is little we can do but once the dust settles this problem will likely solve itself."

uob.509.a: "Maximism is Failing!"

uob.212.t: "Restorationist Countercoup"
uob.212.d: "Today as we tried to take over control of the country, what we thought were loyal Army elements suddenly turned on us. In the chaos, Mosley has fled and in the ensuing power-vacuum, forces loyal to Percy Hobart, long time face of reactionary elements within the Armed Forces,  have attempted to usher in a Counterrevolution! However, Arthur Horner, who has vowed to restore the supremacy of the TUC, along with militia loyalists have sprung up against Hobart's units. With Horner and his rag-tag band of militiamen being the sole defense the Revolution has against Hobart's battle-hardened soldiers, the fate of Revolutionary Britain hangs in the balance."
uob.212.a: "Horner's men are able to beat back Hobart! Long Live the Revolution!"
uob.212.b: "Hobart's soldiers are able to overcome Horner! Death to the Revolution!"


uob.510.t: "The Junta's Next Move"
uob.510.d: "It has only been a short time since Hobart and the various reactionary cliques gathered around his personage seized power in Britain. In that short time since the coup, the brave men and women of the armed forces have begun restoring a semblance of order, although the new regime is still far from secure. However, the exact brand of order that has begun to be instated differs greatly, from clique to clique. Quite a few have begun 'reinstating the King's Justice,' bringing back the Law and Order of the old UK, still in exile in Canada, preparing for the King's return to our fair isles. Others, especially those who press closer to Hobart, simply instate military order, with no other goal than keeping the streets safe and the factories running.  While all know just how tenuous our position is, this growing difference between our various wings is a bigger threat to our rule than even the Syndicalists who still fight for their dead revolution. With this being the case, Hobart has called for a clandestine meeting of the heads of all cliques who sided with us during the coup, to hammer out our issues. The representatives of the 'Windsorite' cliques have made their case quite simply; there is one legitimate government for these isles, and that is the King, and the King alone. While yes, the King may have been forced to flee Britain, he is still the sole figure who can unite these lands again. The leaders of the 'Non-Aligned' cliques most notable among them being Hobart himself, fierily disagree with the Windsorites whole heartily, denouncing them as cowards. Not rejecting the concept of a Monarchy, they simply wish to see Britain free, from both Syndicalist tyranny and Windsorite cowardice.  As the arguments come to an end and voting begins, the future of Britain lies in the balance. "
uob.510.a: "The Windsors are cowards! Britain will never again bow to those false Kings!"
uob.510.b: "Only the Windsors can save us! Long Live the King!"


uob.511.t: "Counter-Revolution in Britain!"
uob.511.d: "The Totalist Dictatorship in Britain is over! The military, commanded by the war hero T.E. Lawrence, also known as 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Lawrence of Germania' has taken control. The background of the coup is unclear; It seems that infighting between the wings of the Syndicalist government is involved. Lawrence has called for an immediate cease-fire at all fronts, he wants to bring the British troops back home and to secure the rapidly collapsing nation."
uob.511.a: "Hoorah for Lawrence of Britannia!"

uob.512.t: "The Fate of Eric Blair"
uob.512.d: "Blair was a committed Maximist when Mosley was in power. Yet he seemingly switched sides once it became clear that Mosley was doomed. And during the last hours of being on the British Isles, Blair attempted to overthrow Mosley. It is unclear whether or not Blair would become another Mosley if he took power, but he swears that he changed. Should se spare him, or take him out."

uob.514.d: "Y Glais’ reforms have succeeded, and all of the Constituent Nations have been granted Nominal independence. They are independent in most ways, though they pledge loyalty to us and London has nominal control over foreign affairs. Many have denounced this action, while many (Particularly in Scotland and Wales) commed this action, and celebrate their newfound independence."

uobflavour.29.d: "Loyal comrade Blair has announced before the masses the establishment of the Ministry of Truth! The former Senate House of University of London has been refitted to suits the needs of the Ministry and provide a headquarters for the newly formed ''Anti-Revolutionary Cognition Policing Unit''. The crucial task of the MOT is to directly combat anti-revolutionary behaviours and promote healthy of loyal thought. Responsibilities of the MOT include the mass destruction of reactionary literature, necessary falsicfication of historical events that tarnish the reputation of the revolution and production of news media, education and entertainment for the populace of Britain."
uobflavour.29.a: "Ignorance is Strength..."

uobflavour.30.t: "March of the Biff Boys!"
uobflavour.30.d: "The Maximist Defence Force, more commonly referred to as the “Biff Boys”, are a paramilitary force composed of Mosley’s most loyal comrades. They serve as the stewards of the revolution, their mission is simple. Do what is necessary to defend Britain and most importantly, the Chairman, from all threats within the nation. Dressed in their infamous black polo necked uniforms they assert the dominance of Maximism across the nation. Mosley has promised the workers of Britain liberty, freedom and democracy. However there exists threats that would harm Mosley’s vision for Britain, to defend freedom and democracy these threats must be dealt with..."
uobflavour.30.a: "Hurrah for the Biff Boys!"

uobflavour.31.t: "A Matter of Urgency"
uobflavour.31.d: "The Revolutionary Police, much like their prior counterparts, are inefficient when it comes to properly tackling threats. It is due to this factor that Mosley was persuaded by his comrades to provide full immunity and power to the MDF. Although not exactly legal, few are in a position to question Mosley’s actions. The MDF have been given permission to investigate unions suspected of disloyalty, in order to better secure the country for Mosley and to make sure no traitors are in our midst. Whilst on one routine inspection inside union headquarters, an MDF detachment under leadership of Comrade Ted Lewis discovered plans for an organised protest to take place directly in front of Mosley’s planned speech at Cable Street. The documents included a list of notable union leaders and politicians who had associated with the planned protest, though it is curious as to why such an important document would be found so easily. Regardless, these inspections are secretive and unknown to union leaders.\n\n If such a protest were to take place, it could have drastic consequences on the Maximist’s perceived power and popularity. Many, including Comrade Lewis, have suggested raiding the homes of those detailed on the list. This could be effective in putting down this opposition however, and forcing the police to exercise such a controversial operation along with blatantly going against Mosley’s stated commitment to freedom and democracy could have even worse consequences..."
uobflavour.31.a: "Execute the operation!"
uobflavour.31.b: "Such a mass arrest would surely cause more chaos?"

uobflavour.32.t: "The Day of Long Batons..."
uobflavour.32.d: "After some time pondering the consequences of the existence of a unified political opposition, Chairman Mosley came to the conclusion that the potential instability and chaos caused by open disrespect of power is a threat greater than any commitment to freedom. After all, are people not at their most free when they are serving the state? The freedom to serve a purpose, to be proud of one’s nation and its achievements, that is the freedom Mosley provides. It is for this reason that under the newly passed Defence Regulation 18B, Mosley authorised a joint MDF-Police operation to arrest those suspected of threatening the peace of the nation. Along with those names on the union’s list for opposition, many who have been suspected of disloyalty without solid evidence too are to be targeted.\n\nPrecisely coordinated raids across London occured with Police dragging out suspected traitors to the revolution. The media arm of the Maximists, Revolutionary British People’s Broadcasting Company, have already stirred up news reports of a traitorous coup foiled by brave comrades such as Ted Lewis. The show of force across the entire city is enough to convince even the most hardcore counter-revolutionary that Mosley’s tight grip over the nation will not be easy to shake..."
uobflavour.32.a: "A victory for the nation!"

uobflavour.33.t: "Mosley, the man of freedom!"
uobflavour.33.d: "After some time pondering the consequences of the existence of a unified political opposition, Chairman Mosley came to the conclusion that the potential instability and chaos caused by the mass arrest of suspected political opponents was greater than the risk of vocal dissent. Mosley is dedicated to the liberation of the worker, if they wish to oppose him then they shall surely be swayed back. If not by Mosley’s grandiose plans for unity and peace then through newly planned “re-education centres”.\nDespite those within his inner circle disagreeing, the Chairman has refused to permit the arrests of politicians and union leaders, their links to this potential protest are dubious at best. The Chairman is confident in his ability to win the minds of the nation. Meanwhile rumours of syndicalist leaders and unions uniting against Mosley are becoming louder and louder."
uobflavour.33.a: "A wise decision from the Chairman."

uobflavour.35.t: "The Rally of Cable Street"
uobflavour.35.d: "Mosley took to the platform, overlooking thousands of supporters, firmly gripping the microphone he scanned the horizon. Engulfed by the unwavering support, the chants of ‘We want Mosley!’ created an atmosphere of pure zeal. The flags of Maximist blocked the sky, a true blockade of support that towered over any attempt of protest. It is clear that the arrests worked, without leadership the opposition was powerless, Biff Boys dealt with any troublemakers brave or stupid enough to cause a scene. This rally at Cable Street, the heart of Mosley’s opposition, represented more than rhetoric. It was symbolic of the Chairman’s control over the entire nation.\n’Let us to Europe and to the world proclaim that the heart of this great people is undaunted and invincible. This flag still challenges the winds of destiny. This flame still burns. This glory shall not die. The soul of Revolution is alive, and England again dares to be great!’"
uobflavour.35.a: "A momentous occasion!"

uobflavour.36.t: "The Battle of Cable Street"
uobflavour.36.d: "The Maximist fears were accurate, on the day of Mosley’s most important rally hundreds and then thousands converged on Cable Street. This was to be no ordinary rally, Cable Street is the heart of his opposition, it would be here that the Chairman would announce his  radical plans of restructuring the nation. Somehow information detailing the dismissed raids had leaked to the public, an already angered populace of union workers and politicians loyal to the formerly Fed/Con controlled TUC were further galvanised by fears that their liberties are at great risk. A united demonstration prepared in the early hours of the morning by constructing makeshift barricades, by midday Mosley had to be escorted in by a convoy of police as the protestors had begun to engage directly with law enforcement. Despite the warnings of the police, Chairman Mosley refused to back down, undeterred he took to climbing on top of his escort van to declare the now rioting crowd of protesters as enemies of the nation. By this point there was no stopping the inevitable chaos.\n\nBiff Boys entered into the fray wielding clubs pushing past police officers and clashing directly with protestors, crowds swarmed each other with nearby buildings being set a torch and windows smashed. Mosley had feared such an escalation of violence would take place, he ordered the military to stand guard, as he witnessed pure mayhem he called for action. Soldiers marched through taking aim at the crowds, scrapping Biff Boys and police officers quickly fled behind the soldiers as a volley of gunfire hit the rioting mob. At once the crowd dispersed allowing the soldiers, police and maximists alike to grab whoever they could. By the end of the day Cable Street was a mess of blood, smoldering rubble and pickets torn apart, Mosley may have won the battle however the war of the populace’s minds was about to begin."
uobflavour.36.a: "A dark day for the nation."

uobflavour.37.t: "TUC Replaced by the National Council"
uobflavour.37.d: "After the revolution, the Trade Union Congress was elevated from labour union to the governmental power of the nation. The intention was to create a truly democratic system where for the first time in British history, the workers themselves could rule. However since then the TUC has degenerated into a bureaucratic and corrupt mess of political scheming. It became the new parliament. For this reason Chairman Mosley has decided to rein in the TUC, using his newfound ability to pass legislation allowing for the formation of a National Council. This council will be composed of members elected directly by the people to represent their field of expertise, much like the original goal of the TUC. However these councils will be loyal to the Chairman, they will serve to advise not to broker deals driven for personal gain. All councillors will then personally be approved by Mosley who will accept their democratic victory against their opponents. The TUC has not officially been disbanded, rather reformed into a lower house of government, the TUC will see its influence and political domination destroyed and provided with a new directive. Serve the Chairman."
uobflavour.37.a: "The TUC was holding us back anyway."

uobflavour.38.t: "Maximism for the Million"
uobflavour.38.d: "Freedom is to serve a cause. Happiness is fulfilled by duty. Liberty is to liberate your mind from mental corruption\n\nSo say the posters that line the streets of cities, towns and villages across the nation. Posters plastered in mass by loyal labourers fulfilling their duty. In Mosley’s society it matters not who you are, a lowly milkman or a brave operative of the R.E.D both serve their part in the machine of the nation. Maximism truly is the ideology for the masses for it preaches the importance of the individual as long as they work in the collective. A single person driven by self interest can achieve nothing, despite their best efforts they will one day die and be forgotten. However millions of people all working together are able to build a utopia, one that will last long beyond their natural lives. One that is built from the souls of individuals, preserving their spirit and providing immortality for the mass. You may die, but you will live on through the Chairman."
uobflavour.38.a: "The people love Mosley!"

uobflavour.39.t: "A Union for the Unionless?"
uobflavour.39.d: "As the process of Devolution nears it's completion, a bill has reached the floor of the reformed TUC, calling for the creation of a special union for that section of the populace commonly referred to as the Lumpenproletariat. Also known simply as the 'Lumpenm' this portion of the populace, roughly 3-5%, are those who cannot or chose not to work, those who steal to get by, those who panhandle, the poorest of the poor in other words, those whom a more reactionary society would consider not but dirty and lazy degenerates. While the Union of Britain prided itself on it's progressive and equal laws, many of those in the TUC and even many simply within the working class, viewed held themselves to be greater then the Lumpen. Indeed, in many ways life for the Lumpen is the same under the us and it was under the Reactionaries. Unlike under the reactionaries however, the Lumpen have lost the right to vote. Due to the driving force of the Revolution being Unions, only those workers within Unions legally have the right to vote. With the Lumpen either not having work or not making enough to afford dues, they remain outside a Union, and thus outside the political process. While it is not only the Lumpen who are effected by this, some workers choose to not join a Union, they are the most overwhelming effected. Not only this, but due to them not being a members in a Union, they are oft denied social benefits, although they still have access to much more than they did under the reactionary Windsors. Due to this, and among other factors, many consider the Lumpen to be a breeding ground for reactionary idealism, which does seem to be correct.\n\n This is where the proposed bill enters the discussion. Due to the growing presence of reactionary elements within the Lumpen, and due to the fact they have been long ignored by the old corrupted TUC, the bill would have a special and due free Union created, especially for the Lumpen. While in reality, the Union would almost function solely as a meeting hall, it would allow a sizeable section of the population to finally have a voice in government. Those who oppose the bill, mostly those outside of the Autonomists, say that creating such a Union, we would encourage laziness, why work when you can simply join the Lumpen Union and reap all the benefits of a proper worker? Due to the controversial aspect of the bill, the TUC is almost evenly split. Support or condemnation from the Chairman would surely be enough to break the gridlock, and thus both sides have reached out to the Executive, and Chairman Glais is expected to make an announcement regarding the bill in the coming hours."
uobflavour.39.a: "We cannot glorify those who can't support themselves, condemn the bill!"
uobflavour.39.b: "The entirety of the People's voice must be heard! Support the bill!"

uob.2000.t: "Reports of Anti-Mosley Activity"
uob.2000.d: "Ever since Oswald Mosley’s ascension to the role of Chairman of the TUC, the zealous firebrand has managed to rouse both widespread adoration from some and deep disgust within others. Chief amongst his detractors have been the numerous camps of conservative generals and officers that compose much of the Union’s Old Guard. As Mosley pursues his grand ambitions further and further, he has emboldened these foes into what the state has deemed as ‘Anti-Mosleyite Action.’ These rabblerousers will cause detrimental effects to the Mosley regime’s stability, and as such, if the new Chairman seeks to hold onto his newfound position of power, they will have to be dealt with, one way or another. If Mosley instead chooses to ignore these disgruntled old wardogs, it is almost certain that, should he attempt to use the army for anything they deem to far, his administration will be quickly overcome."
uob.2000.a: "Ignore these withered old fools. Politics is no place for mere soldiers."
uob.2000.b: "Any threat is a credible threat, see to it that these old dogs are put out to pasture."


uob.2001.t: "Rebuilding the Union?"
uob.2001.d: "With Comrade Lawrence's rise to power now nearing completion, many, both within and without the increasingly centralized armed forces, have begun to call for the reunification of our fair isle. While it was only a short time ago since our loss, our army is already in a much better shape, and we stand to finish what Mosley could not, and reunite our fractured nation, and yet perhaps not. After all, it was the same army that lost the home countries that now pledges loyalty to us. Who is to say that we will not fail a second time? Besides, both Scotland and Wales have begun reaching out to the Great Powers, meaning that we could poteninally drag ourselves into a disastrous war with the imperialists of the Reichspact and Entente. While the reunification of the Union is all but inevitable, the choice to march now or later remains to be made."
uob.2001.a: "The time is ripe! We march for a United Britain!"
uob.2001.b: "Unification can wait, building up the new England cannot."
