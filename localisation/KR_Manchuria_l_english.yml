MAN_Pacify_The_Countryside_desc: "Bandits have roamed the Manchuria countyside for decades, indeed, Zhang Zuolin was himself a bandit. We must succeed where past governments have failed and protect even the smallest villages from banditry. For this, we will have the people's loyalty."
MAN_Promote_The_Regional_Identity: "Promote the Regional Identity"
MAN_Promote_The_Regional_Identity_desc: "To secure our state, the Mancurian people must view themselves as Manchurian alone. While it may take decades to eliminate the idea that Manchuria is a part of China, we must initiate the process."

MAN_Industrial_Development_Commission_desc: "Manchuria is one of the foremost hotbeds of heavy industry in continental East Asia, and our industrial base continues to grow.

MAN_Expand_The_Yingkou_Port_desc: "Yinkou is the largest port of the Liaodong bay. Its expansion up to this point has been rather haphazard and inefficiency is rampant. We must invest in bringing the port up to modern standards."
