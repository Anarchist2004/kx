afg.0.d:0 "In the remnants of the Raj to our south, dissent has sprung up like wildflowers in the wake of Edward VIII's succession. In Kabul, we have our own troubles keeping the latent discontent of reform down. A repeat of the victorious Third Anglo-Afghan War might cement our own position whilst winning new lands and subjects for the crown!"

afg.3.d:0 "Curses! The Afghan dogs have completely overpowered us and have reduced our proud nation to humiliation.

afg.5.t:0 "Shia Muslims Flee The War"
afg.5.d:0 "For decades the situation of the Shia minority in Afghanistan has been bad, the post-war situation wasn't gold, and another war could possibly only make it worse. Shia imams in the provinces of Herat and Farah have encouraged the Shia minority to flee into their friendly neighbour Persia. Let's hope the Persians send them back, we need that manpower."
afg.5.a:0 "Traitors!"

afg.6.t:0 "Refugees from Afghanistan"
afg.6.d:0 "Yet another war has started between Afghanistan and Dehli. The Shia minority in Afghanistan fears this will only make their situation worse, therefor they have decided to start a new life here, however this situation might be more problematic then what we think. If we accept these people into our nation the government of Afghanistan will be deeply upset with us."

afg.8.t:0 "Habibullah flees Kabul"
afg.8.d:0 "Despite our attempts to suppress it, news of our defeat has reached Kabul. Mass protests and armed insurrection followed shortly after. Seeing the writing on the wall, Habibullah emptied the treasury in the dead of night and snuck off to parts unknown, abandoning the royal court to its fate.\n\nUsing his ties with the local religious establishment and his position as commander-in-chief of the Afghan army, Habibullah's brother and heir, Nasrullah, marched into Kabul with what little troops he has left and was crowned the new Emir of Afghanistan.\n\nDespite this, news of the defeat continues to spread throughout Afghanistan, and it won't be long until the land is plunged into civil war."
afg.8.a:0 "All hail Emir Nasrullah?"

afg.9.t:0 "Order in Afghanistan"
afg.9.d:0 "It seems that the reverberations of our Southern defeat have begin to subside. After initial instability and conflict, we have taken the reins of our government and adequately silenced any agitated voices that yet remain. Order is restored, after long last."

afg.14.t:0 "Mohammed Nadir Shah's Claim to the Throne"
afg.14.d:0 "Having assumed the throne through not so cordial methods and despite his relation to the royal family, Mohammed Nadir Shah desperately needs legitimacy to shore up his regime. It is suggested that his majesty convey a 'loya jirga' (grand assembly) of Pashtun leaders to confirm his ascension."
afg.14.a:0 "Call a loyal jirga to confirm my ascension!"

afg.15.t:0 "Mohammed Nadir Shah and the Loya Jirga"
afg.15.d:0 "Speaking before the Grand Assembly of tribal leaders, Nadir Shah hopes to receive enough support to continue his rule unhindered. However, without the support of the local leaders, the new regime's days will be numbered."
afg.15.a:0 "The assembly hails Mohammed Nadir as king!"
afg.15.b:0 "The assembly denounces Mohammed Nadir!"

afg.16.t:0 "Nadir Shah's Royal Oligarchy"
afg.16.d:0 "With the war-torn country finally resembling some kind of order, Nadir Shah has resolved to reorganise his cabinet to secure continued stability for Afghanistan. Packing the government with relatives would be the obvious way to bind the state apparatus to Nadir's ambitions, but reaching out to some of Amanullah's supporters might also bridge a wide gap between the radical and moderate reformists."
afg.16.a:0 "Let my younger brother, Shah Wali Khan, enforce my will!"
afg.16.b:0 "My brother, Muhammed Hashim, will head the government!"

afg.17.t:0 "Status of Amanullah's Reforms"
afg.17.d:0 "Mohammed Nadir Shah has taken control of our shaken nation after the failure of Amanullah Khan to enforce Afghan progress. Well aware that a great contributing factor of his predecessor's downfall was the speed of his westernisation reforms, Nadir Shah none the less has to address the great issue of rebuilding Afghanistan."
afg.17.a:0 "Discontinue social reform, but galvanise the improvement of our infrastructure!"
afg.17.b:0 "Cave in to the traditionalists and abandon all pretence of modernity!"
afg.17.c:0 "I shall succeed where Amanullah failed and bring Afghanistan into the modern world!"

afg.18.t:0 "Sarrafs have left Afghanistan"
afg.18.d:0 "Sarrafs are a group of Indian merchants who travel between Afghanistan and Delhi, exchanging money and trading goods in both of them. Our economy hardly depends on their visits. Now, the war has come and borders are safe no more. Only a few of these sarrafs are brave enough to continue trading with us. With most of their caravan are gone we now suffer from economic crisis."
afg.18.a:0 "We don't need these Indian dogs anyway!"

afg.19.t:0 "Sarrafs returns"
afg.19.d:0 "The war is over and borders are now safe. Nothing more disturb the sarrafs now and the first wave of them already resumed their trading within Afghanistan. Soon, our economy will recover."
afg.19.a:0 "Welcome, gentlemen!"

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_AMANULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Born in 1892, as the third son of Habibullah Khan, Amanullah Khan was, upon reaching proper age, installed as governor of Kabul and commander of the Army, gaining many important tribal allies. When the Weltkrieg broke out Amanullah, seeing this as a chance to seize lands on the other side of the Durand Line, joined Nasrullah in urging for joining into the Weltkrieg on the Kaiserreich’s side. When his father remained steadfast in his neutrality, Nasrullah and Amanullah, using mainly Amanullah’s tribal contacts, gathered up a force to invade the Raj. The initial push was a debacle and Amanullah was forced to retreat back into Afghanistan with the Raj hot on his heels. So began the Third Anglo-Afghan War. \n\nAmanullah was then forced to watch as his Army struggled to fight off the British and Indian invaders. However, when the Weltkrieg in Europe came to an end, Afghanistan was given its due. Since then, however, Amanullah has seen his father grow fat and lazy on the throne and angled his way to become his successor. Now having triumphed over Nasrullah, his uncle, and former ally, Amanullah stands as the unchallenged Emir of Afghanistan. Amanullah is not content with just sitting on his present victories, however. He sees a future Afghanistan shining like a beacon of modernity in the roughness of Central Asia. He sees a future free of imperialist influence and the meddling of outside powers and their ‘spheres of influence’. For too long has mighty Afghanistan been forced to hide in the shade of the Raj, and the King of the God-granted Kingdom of Afghanistan and its dependencies been regarded as the leader of a second-rate power. Only through blood and steel shall the Afghan people carve their place in the Sun from the corpse of the British Empire, just as the Germans did. Now it remains to be seen if he can achieve his dream."
POLITICS_HABIBULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Habibullah's reign has thus far been marked by reforms and attempts to modernize his country by working to bring modern medicine and other technology to Afghanistan. Born in 1871, in Uzbekistan, he would rise to power in 1901, upon the death of his father, the previous Emir. Habibullah’s early reign was one of reform, as he quickly issued a general amnesty to his father’s many enemies, allowing them to return to the country. He also began to import new technology and further modern science within Afghanistan. He also was a social reformer, repealing many draconian criminal punishments while making the legal system fairer in general. One of his principal reforms was dismantling his father’s internal intelligence system that oppressed huge swaths of the country. In 1903, Habibullah founded the Habibia school as well as a military academy. \n\nWhen the Weltkrieg broke out, Habibullah took great pains to keep his nation neutral in the War. Despite the insistence of the Sultan in Istanbul and the Kaiser in Berlin, his proximity to India and the British made any intervention seemingly doomed to fail. This all changed with the defeat of the British in Europe and the ensuing revolutions that ripped through their Empire, however. As chaos gripped the Raj and British rule faltered, Habibullah was initially hesitant to do anything. This meant little to his generals, who quickly crossed the Durand Line and seized border towns of the Raj. Habibullah, unable to reverse this without appearing fatally weak, was forced to go along with this fait accompli. This bolstered his popularity at home since the Raj, still battling for its own survival, was unable to resist.\n\nTwenty years after his victory, Habibullah has had to watch his grand dream of a powerful Afghanistan begin to wither. In the hinterlands, rebellion has once again reared its ugly head while members of his own family eye the crown hungrily. If Afghanistan is to be truly stable, Habibullah knows he must do something."
POLITICS_KALAKANI_DESC:0 "Habibullah Kalakani was born in 1891 in the village of Kalakan, north of Kabul. An ethnic Tajik, his father was named Aminullah and delivered water to people's homes. This heritage is how Kalakani gained the nickname ‘Bacha-ye Saqao’, or son of the water carrier. During his adolescence, Kalakani ventured out of his village and traveled to the city of Kabul. In the south, he met an old Sufi who told the young Habibullah that he would become king one day. He would fight with the Afghan Army in the Third Anglo-Afghan War and the Khost Rebellion. After being discharged from the army after attacking a superior officer, Habibullah escaped Kabul in the dead of night and once again returned to a life of banditry. Habibullah's exploits as a bandit gradually gathered him a small but loyal band of brigands, robbing caravans during the day and hiding out at night. Afghan Army units sent to round him up were routed or brought over to his cause and it was not long before Kalakani became the real authority in Eastern Afghanistan. While Habibullah grew fat and lazy in Kabul, Kalakani began to draw up plans to fulfill his destiny and become King of Afghanistan. However, despite his growing power and ambitions, he was reluctant to strike at Kabul and tear the heart out of the decadent regime he had come to despise. That time came eventually with the catastrophic war against the Raj, and despite all odds, Kalakani now has seized the reins of government. What he intends to do with his newfound power however only Kalakani and Allah know and neither of them seems interested in telling."
POLITICS_NASRULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Nasrullah Khan was born in 1874, the second of three sons to Emir Abdur Rahman. As a young man in his early 20s, Nasrullah was sent on a journey to the UK to pay his father’s respect to Queen Victoria. Since he spoke little English and did not make a good impression on the local press who described him as a 'stolid, impassive and bored youth'. Nevertheless, he paid his respects as demanded and after a detour through Paris and Italy, returned home. This experience, while considered a diplomatic failure, prepared the young man for life in statecraft. When his older brother Habibullah rose to the throne, Nasrullah was suddenly one of the most important men in Afghanistan, if not more so than before. \n\nFirst to court him were the religious authorities who languished under his father Abdur. Nasrullah was a deeply religious man by this point and quickly warmed to their influence. The second was his brother, the Emir, who saw him as a potential rival. To secure his loyalty, Habibullah made him Commander in Chief, President of the State Council, and later heir over his own sons. Nasrullah was also kept loyal by the fact that the Emir held their brother, Mohammed, and Mohammed’s mother as little more than prisoners. Nasrullah was no Claudius, for he was loyal to Habibullah throughout his reign.\n\nDuring this time Nasrullah also grew to despise the British, despite his early venture to the Isles. The British had, under an earlier treaty, kept the Afghan government from maintaining valuable alliances with the powerful tribes of the Afghan hinterlands. At the same time, British influence began to slowly creep deeper and deeper into Afghanistan, which Nasrullah saw as a threat to his family and his people. When the Weltkrieg broke out, Nasrullah saw his chance to strike decisively at the British. He, along with the Young Afghan movement, urged the Emir to join the war on the side of the Turks and Germans. To their frustration, Habibullah remained neutral. When the Niedermayer Hentig Expedition arrived in Afghanistan, Nasrullah found a new group of loyal allies. Along with the Expedition, Nasrullah proposed numerous ways to undermine the British but all of them were dismissed by the Emir. As the Germans’ victory seemed imminent, however, Nasrullah finally got fed up with waiting for his brother. Without orders Nasrullah helped round up a group of tribes on the border and invaded the Raj. He was beaten, decisively and the nation he loved was dragged into a devastating war. When the Weltkrieg ended, so did the Third Anglo-Afghan War and Nasrullah Khan had achieved his dream. \n\nTwenty years later, Nasrullah now sits at the helm of his beloved nation, having defeated usurper and conspirator alike. With Allah guiding him, who can stand between him and greatness?"
POLITICS_NADIR_SHAH_DESC:0 "The wild card’s hand has been revealed for the world to see. Born to an exiled branch of the royal family in India, Mohammed Nadir Shah would return to Afghanistan only in the early 1900s, when Habibullah Khan married Nadir’s sister. He served admirably in Habibullah’s government until the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Afghan War. While faring decent against the seasoned British forces, he was never able to gain the successes needed to cripple the Raj. Instead, he was forced to fight on for years until an end to the war in Europe forced an end to the War in Afghanistan.\n\nWhile Afghanistan had triumphed, Nadir was left with a bitter aftertaste, and he was further enraged by radical proposals for the modernization of Afghanistan. While no traditionalist like Nasrullah, Nadir felt that some of Habibullah’s more ambitious reforms, no doubt suggested by his son Amanullah, were too far, stripping Afghanistan of its identity. During this era of peace, if not animosity, the British have appealed to Nadir Shah, promising him the throne in exchange for his cooperation. Now Nadir rules in Afghanistan with undeniable help from his former enemies, the British. While few expect him to kowtow to Delhi and Ottawa for long, even fewer see his reign as one of continuing reform. Nadir instead seems to want to propel Afghanistan into the future, but also pay respects to its admirable past. Whether or not he can continue this balancing act remains to be determined."

afghanredux.0.t:0 "The Graveyard of Empires Stirs"
afghanredux.0.d:0 "Much has changed for the Emirate of Afghanistan since the turn of the century. Habibullāh Khan’s reign initially endeavored to push his once reformative agenda into practice despite resistance from the nation’s many entrenched conservative sources of influence. Despite this, Afghanistan has seen some progress, with its legal, economic and educational systems all receiving minorly beneficial reforms, but above all, no institution within our Emirate has flourished like our military has, with Habibullāh passing a slew of new laws to improve the Afghan Army. This military prowess was built up as the earliest years of the new century dragged on until the Weltkrieg broke out in 1914. \n\nAs the horrific Weltkrieg dragged on, Afghanistan was put under increasing pressure from both the Kaiserreich and the Ottoman Empire to join the conflict on their behalf. Initially, Habibullāh resisted these calls for war, instead turning inward as he focused on ruling his own kingdom sealed away from the wider world. However, this peace would be shattered in 1917, when a band of tribes rallied by Nasrullah Khan and Ghāzī Amānullāh Khān disobeyed all previous orders and took a secretive gamble to push into British India without informing their Emir. Without support from the wider armed forces, Amānullāh’s forces were disastrously beaten and quickly forced back into Afghani territory, dragging the nation into the Weltkrieg and sparking a third war between us and the Anglos ... \n\nTwo years prior, the Kaiserreich established the Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition, a military attache aimed at training, supplying, and otherwise aiding the Afghani forces for a surprise attack against the Anglo-Indian forces. Eventually, the cacophony of the Weltkrieg drew silent, and Afghanistan stood on the side of the victors.\n\nAs the decades since that horrific conflict have worn on, Habibullāh’s rule has only drifted further from his original ideals as he grows lazier and more opulent with age. It is now 1936, and the German mission is still here, Habibullāh still lounges on his throne, and our Emirate is as unstable as ever. The constant meddling of the Kaiser’s expeditionary force has only driven up unrest, regardless of the military benefits it has provided, and this chaotic situation has only been stoked by the rising radicalism being proliferated within the Provisional Government of India which we have so generously harbored. The Young Afghans, a local nationalist movement, grow increasingly vocal over their displeasure with Habibullāh’s rule, and the Emir’s two main rivals of Amānullāh and Nasrullah are at each other’s throats, each vying for their seat on Habibullāh’s throne. The aging Emir is growing desperate to keep his seat of power intact, and some whisper that he is even willing to start another war to do it. The nation of Afghanistan is once again on the edge of great change or utter collapse, and only Allah knows which way it will fall."

afghanredux.1.t.defeat:0 "King Habibullah has fled the country!"
afghanredux.1.d.victory:0 "After our brilliant victory against the vile and treacherous British and their pawns of the Delhi Dominion, thus proving once again Afghanistan's nickname of Graveyards of Empire, the power and popularity of our great king has never been higher. The previously disunited tribes now find unity in the pride of the newfound Afghan power and the many plots against our sovereign seem to have dissipated. It was decided to organize a great and sumptuous parade in the streets of Kabul, with a huge crowd and all the tribal and political representatives of the country present during the event. At the end of the parade, King Ghazi Habibullah Khan delivered a speech to his people praising the merits of Afghanistan's modernization and its proud army during the Fifth Anglo-Afghan War. To the surprise of his people, the King announced the formation of a new Barakzai Empire, risen from the ashes of the Durrani and Mughals, and that he would lead it to greatness. He left the stage to the loud applause of both his people and the tribal leaders.\n\nMeanwhile in Delhi, news of the announcement of 'Mughal ambitions' has shaken the government to its core. Communications between Delhi and Ottawa are frantic. Fear of another invasion, one which could see the complete annexation of the Raj, has paralyzed the British administration. The Entente's grip over India seems to be at its lowest point yet."
afghanredux.1.d.defeat:0 "After our humiliating defeat against the British forces in the Fifth Anglo-Afghan War, the position of King Habibullah had never been so precarious and fragile, the numerous conspiracies against him by the tribal lords and even some members of the government intensified greatly. The tribal instability in our country has also greatly increased as Afghan national pride has been torn to shreds and a strong resentment against the King is felt among the population. Undoubtedly because of these factors, having failed to modernize Afghanistan and lead it to glory, and fearing for his life, our King fled the country in the early hours of the morning with some of his relatives and much of the treasury. This flight did not help the stability of the country, which is on the verge of chaos as conflicts spark between various political factions each wanting more control. The future of Afghanistan is grim."

The war is hotly contested right now, with both sides having a fair chance at victory. Our support could help tip the balance in favor of the Afghans, especially in the battle for the air. Since Afghanistan and the German Empire are on friendly terms, helping the Afghans out would reaffirm our ties and further improve relations. In addition, such a move would surely come as a snub to the Canadians, something that is always welcome by the German people. However, with Black Monday currently ravaging our economy and the Empire having bigger problems to deal with than Afghanistan's distant wars, perhaps it might be best to keep the planes and men to ourselves. Some have pointed out that while it would be nice to have a strong friend in the region, supporting the Afghans comes with the risk of upsetting the Canadians at a time when their new King provides an opportunity for renewed relations, and would undoubtedly hurt us in the long run should Delhi emerge victorious.

If we were to do this, loyal servants of Allah from around the world would rally behind the banners of the Barakzai dynasty. They claim if we do they would have both Allah and the faithful mujahideen on their side, meaning they couldn’t fail.

The Queen of Cities easily lives up to her name. He is greeted by a government delegation with a smart and clean honor guard and is first taken around the city for a few hours as the Sultan is said to be asleep. He eats the best food he has in some time, visited numerous historical sights, answered questions asked by throngs of foreign reporters, and finally has his midday prayers in the Hagia Sophia. When he is done he is taken to the Sultan and the two hit it off well. The Sultan asks about the War and how Afghanistan is doing while Amanullah asks about how the Sublime Porte fares in turn. The Sultan pledged to provide support to the Afghan cause by any means necessary, and in turn, humbly requests support. Many in the Royal Court, the Caliph included, believe war may be coming to the Ottoman sphere of influence. The Emir’s son pledged to support the Caliph in any way he could. Amanullah then watched the Palace Guard execute parade maneuvers in the courtyard and appeared thoroughly impressed. Such discipline! Such fervor! He was seen off by the Sultan himself, and as Amanullah sits down in his plane, all consider the visit between the two as a great success. Hopefully, the friendship between our two great nations never dies!"

Finally, he is flown to Qoms where he observes a grand military parade followed by an inspection. Amanullah notes the disheveled looks of some of the soldiers and their disorganization despite the shouts of their commanders. The men are all too sloppy; their uniforms are the wrong size and they conduct their military drills and maneuvers without tempo or panache. During his inspection of what was heralded as an 'elite' division, a soldier further down the line drops his rifle and it goes off, shooting himself in the foot. The Prince is insulted by such a shoddy reception but does his best to contain his dissatisfaction. When he returns to the plane he is all too happy to be out of Tehran."

He is also all too aware of the state of his military before the War and his visit to the Ottomans has given him some ideas as to how to improve his situation. While Amanullah is not first in line to receive the throne, should his father abdicate or be rendered incapable, he is a man of ambition. His uncle, Nasrullah, is a reactionary man, who would rather see Afghanistan wallow in the same troubles that have been affecting it for centuries instead of dragging it into the future. A foolish agenda! Amanullah Khan, one way or another, will have his throne, and he will force Afghanistan, one way or another, into the modern world."

afghanredux.13.d:0 "A three days drive northwest of Kabul, deep into the heart of the western range of the Hindu Kush, and beyond the extent of the Kahmard district lies the Ajar Valley. Prized for its isolation, its pristine and unspoiled natural beauty, and its ample hunting grounds, this isolated and forgotten cut has long been the well-kept secret of Afghani nobles and royals seeking a bountiful foray into the wilds. First traveling here what must be years ago by now with Mohammed Zahir, who has long used this gorge as his own personal plot to hunt the varied beasts of our lands, our king Habibullah and his most trusted confidants have frequently used this strip of wilderness to clear the mind, to discuss politics or matters of the state in private, or even to just take an occasional break from the rigors of rule and statecraft. \n\nThis hunting trip was no different, with Habibullah and his retinue leaving their horses back at the entrance of the pass where a small rest shack stood, continuing deeper into the wilds on foot. Bringing with them only a small amount of survival supplies, their traditional jezails with ample shot and powder, and other various supplies needed for the hunt such as bait and skinning knives, the royal retinue embarked deep into the heart of this ‘Valley of the King’ in search of noble prey such as wild boar, ibex, antelope, markhor, and if they were so lucky, even snow leopard and Asiatic cheetah. As the sun rose high in the arid and crisply blue sky, their multi-day hunt began with their guards lowered and their spirits high, for it's not like anything ever goes awry this far from the causticness of civilization..."

afghanredux.14.t:0 "Disaster Strikes the Hunting Party!"
afghanredux.14.d:0 "It all happened so fast, and without any warning or time to think, but tragedy struck and now our glorious King Habibullah lies dead at the base of the Ajar Valley. \n\nWhile hunting through the rocky crag of the pass on the final day of the hunting trip, their party came across a fabled and magnificent snow leopard silently making its way up the rockface to some unseen cave or den. \n\nDespite the ample amount of antelope and other beasts the party had slain, this final quarry would be the perfect cap to an already amazing venture. However, fate had other plans, and as the retinue scrambled their way up the mountain, disaster struck. With the snow leopard finally catching the hunters’ scent as the wind shifted, the stark white feline bolted, causing the hunting party to attempt to chase after it. However, one of the nobles on the trip with Habibullah lost his footing on the rock face above the king, slipping down the cliff face by a few meters before regaining his grip. Thinking the worst was behind them and disaster was just avoided, the small sighs of relief and quiet cheers ended abruptly when the sound of gunfire cut through the valley. Turning back in horror, Habibullah’s men saw the jezail fall from the slipping noble’s back, hitting the sound of the mountain and misfiring directly into the face of their king. In an explosion of pink mist and grey smoke, a hole the size of a softball was blown through the head of Habibullah, sending the honored king tumbling down to the valley floor, leaving a red trail behind him as he plummeted lifelessly to the ground. As his men quickly repelled down the mountain rushing to the aid of their wounded king, it was far too late to save him by the time they reached his side. Managing to gurgle out a swift goodbye through the blood filling his lungs and throat before finally passing, Habibullah died on the floor of the valley surrounded by some of his closest allies. \n\nA tragic accident if ever there was one, the men wrapped the king’s body in gauze and prepared to take him back to Kabul, dreading having to break it to the nation that the king was well and truly dead. Though all in the retinue understood clearly that this was an accident in every sense of the word, the more cynical within the group believed that upon their return, accusations would begin to fly as rival groups vying for power each start to throw blame on one another. Whatever awaited them in Kabul, they would soon see, but the trek back was sure to be a solemn one."

While some attribute this to the new Emir's solemn personality, others suspect foul play. Nasrullah was never the power-hungry man, but a majority of the public is unaware of the man's personality. Yet, prominent figures in the military are divided in their support for the new Emir, and some fear another conflict so soon.

Now, the Afghan Wild Card is in control of the country and there are few left to challenge him. While his vision for Afghanistan is still hazy, many are hesitant to support him due to his old ties to the British. One thing is clear, however: Nadir Shah is here to stay with most of the military at his back."

These German air wings and volunteers have been drilled in desert warfare during a stopover in Aleppo and, as such, are not totally out of their element. However, there was a mishap, as a German bomber bounced off of the makeshift airbase in Kabul before crashing to the ground. The plane's landing gear was ripped off by the bumpy and uneven surface before the nose was sent careening into the dirt. \n\nIn any case, German advisors are already discussing with our military brass on how to best utilize the expedition. While a group centered around the remnants of the newly revitalized Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition have welcomed these pasty white men with open arms, traditional elements within our nation still regard them with suspicion. Habibullah has built the reputation of being the lapdop of the Hun, and the new developments within our Emirate seem to confirm such a tale.

This has been an immediate boon to our efforts as pious Muslims from across the region and in fact the world have begun to arrive in Kabul to join our struggle. Our airports and travel stops are overrun by pilgrims and warriors who seek Allah's glory by supporting our struggle. However, a countermovement led by the Emir of Mecca have decried this as a purely political maneuver by the Sultan to gain influence in the region, and the Ottoman rivals in Cairo have condemned the Caliph's actions.

The cities of Peshawar and Quetta have been laid to waste by the invading armies and Wali of Swat, Miangul Abdul Wadud, a staunch supporter of the Afghan Kingdom, lays besieged in his fortress, Raja Gira, with no possibility of help from the outside. Seeing the sad state of affairs of the emirate, Nasir ul Mulk, King of Chitral, has declared his allegiance to the British and attacked the Afghan garrisons in his state with his famed Scouts and killed the local Afghan Governor. \n\nAll the while, blood now flows through streets of Kabul and into the river as people try to defend their property and family from looters and bandits as all law enforcement are either overwhelmed or destroyed. The new Emir, Nasrullah Khan, is missing and presumed dead as bandits descended upon the city and the Royal Palace.

At the same time, British Expeditionary Forces under the command of Charles Howard Foulkes have crossed the Khyber Pass once more and are now within reach of Kabul itself. Memories of the Second Anglo-Afghan war are still fresh in the minds of the Afghan populace who now look at the white invaders with fear and apprehension.

After ascending to the throne, Amir Habibullah paid an official visit to British India where he fell in love with Nadir’s sisters. Nadir realizing an opportunity had opened for him, took advantage of the Amir’s philandry, and had his sister married to the Amir. It was quick work to convince the king to let their family to return to Afghanistan. \n\nReturning to Afghanistan, Nadir immediately started to make contacts with previous friends of the branch family and using these contacts, became a general and led the Afghan Army in the Third Anglo-Afghan War. After distinguishing himself in the war, he was made Minister of War and set out to reform the army, a task which was made easier by the involvement of the German military attaché. Now as the country stands at the precipice of war, Nadir Shah looks to destabilize the nation and take over the throne from the decadent royal family. Rumors have reached the ears of the Amir that there have been shady dealings between the British and Nadir Shah about a possible coup but the Amir has turned a deaf ear to these concerns saying his brother-in-law would never harm him for he is like his own brother.

AFG_legacy_mahmud_tarzi_desc:0 "Tarzi, a prominent Afghani politican, was the founder of the Young Afghans, and this man shall not go forgotten. His ideals have shaped the very man that Amanullah is today. We will shape Afghanistan into his vision with the help of Amanullah."

AFG_indian_wild_card_desc:0 "Mohammed Zahir Shah has seized the throne for himself in the chaos following the death of the Emir and its developments! Now, the entire nation waits to see what his next move to consolidate power will be, and whether or not the nation will unite around him."

AFG_game_of_thrones:0 "The Indian Wild Card"
AFG_game_of_thrones_desc:0 "Zahir Shah needs to act quickly, lest the nation fall into turmoil between regional powers and constant seizures of power. He must consolidate quickly, for time is his enemy, and storm clouds are already fomenting over the horizon."

AFG_bandit_king_desc:0 "With the Emir fleeing the nation during its darkest hour, the entire nation has descended into chaos. Always sensing an opportunity, the bandit king of Kohistan, Habibullah Kalakani, has seized the chance and has marched his loyal army to besiege Kabul."

AFG_great_game_desc:0 "We have finally, after nearly an entire century, managed to win the great game against Russia in Afghanistan.

Let us use it well."

AFG_rally_allies:0 "Request Allied Support"
AFG_rally_allies_desc:0 "The Germans and Ottomans have always claimed to be friends with us against the imperialists, so we must request they hold true to that promise.

# NASRULLAH #

AFG_the_crown_prince:0 "The Crown Prince Ascends"
AFG_the_crown_prince_desc:0 "Finally! After decades of carefully planning and determination Nasrullah Khan now sits on the Afghan throne! His enemies still circle, waiting for their time to strike but they will be dealt with in time. It's up to the new Emir to decide the future fate of Afghanistan. While it's impossible to say what Nasrullah will do, his almost unmatched zealotry, love of tradition, and alliance with the conservative religious elements of society can give the world a hint as to what the future holds for the country."
AFG_mourn_habibullah:0 "Settle Tribal Feuds"
AFG_mourn_habibullah_desc:0 "The decadence of Habibullah and his push of Western reforms enraged the conservative tribes of Afghanistan’s hinterlands. They have been in rebellion for years now, left to run riot over the countryside while the Emir in Kabul counts his wives. Now however their only ally in the Royal Family, Nasrullah, has taken the throne and he has called a conference in Kabul to settle the Tribes' grievances and end their incessant fighting."
AFG_nasrullah_rules:0 "Finalize the Ascension"
AFG_nasrullah_rules_desc:0 "Nasrullah has done it and secured his position as Emir. With the Conservatives rallying behind the new Emir their great influence over the country has begun to be exerted in Nasrullah’s favor. Rival factions, claimants and disgruntled citizenry are slowly dispersing as their support evaporates behind this groundswell of support for Nasrullah. With his throne secure however, Nasrullah can really get down to business."
AFG_consolidate_rule:0 "Bring Unity to the Empire"
AFG_consolidate_rule_desc:0 "The instability that has plagued the Emirate has to come to an end if Afghanistan is to thrive. Various rebellions of equally various sizes still roam the countryside, taking advantage of the near-anarchy ushered in by the chaos of Habibullah’s death. While Nasrullah is kind to his friends, these rebels are not his friends. All available military force will be used to disperse these rebels and finally unify the state."
AFG_arrest_opposition:0 "End the Banditry"
AFG_arrest_opposition_desc:0 "The Afghan countryside is almost tailor-made for bandits. Most of the country is an elaborate labyrinth of caves and mountains. It will be hard work, but these mountains must be finely combed to smoke out any remaining bandits who wish to make an easy profit. We have found an especially prolific bandit already, holed up in Tora Bora."
AFG_seize_press:0 "Oversee the Press"
AFG_seize_press_desc:0 "Afghanistan does not have a lot of press outlets already, and most of those we do have are printed. While Nasrullah respects the press and values their independence, he cannot let them run amok. If they print falsehoods, they could destabilize the Emirate and throw the nation into chaos. To remedy this, Nasrullah will invite the heads of the largest media companies in the country to meet with him. They won't be outright censored per se, but Nasrullah will make it clear that any falseness will be punished. Severely."
AFG_find_amanullah:0 "Put an End to the Young Afghans!"
AFG_find_amanullah_desc:0 "The so-called ‘Young Afghans’ don't know what's good for them! They seek progress and modernity in the face of all of its hazards! We saw what happened when their progenitor, the Young Turks, took over the Sublime Porte. The group is already reeling from the exile of their man in the Royal Family, Amanullah. Nasrullah has ordered the police and army to launch a series of raids on known Young Afghan hideouts and ordered its leaders arrested. With their leaders gone, the wayward souls will return to the fold and be welcomed."
AFG_reverse_secularization:0 "Reverse Secularization"
AFG_reverse_secularization_desc:0 "Habibullah made great strides in many things, and probably the most egregious was the increased secularization of Afghanistan. The Emirate is tied fundamentally to Allah, so Habibullah’s attempts to separate the two are simply laughable. Nasrullah, with the support of his cleric allies, will begin to undo these ‘reforms’ and make Afghanistan right once more. We will mesh our state into its fundamental religion so much that to try and separate the two once more would be impossible. "
AFG_the_afghan_journeyman:0 "Regarding the Brigand King"
AFG_the_afghan_journeyman_desc:0 "The most notorious of the bandit rebels is Habibullah Kalakani. He and his brigands continue to be a thorn in our side trying to pull our nation even further to the right. However, while some in our military and government want us to outright destroy him, Nasrullah remains hesitant. While Kalakani at his most radical is little more than a despot, some of his less radical positions are not too different from Nasrullah, and rumor has it that there are talks between him and the bandit king."
AFG_traditional_roles:0 "Re-establish the Darogha"
AFG_traditional_roles_desc:0 "Afghanistan is a land that almost refuses to be ruled. Its ruggedness and rural nature makes any central control difficult. Our additions in India only magnify this problem. To better control the rabble Nasrullah has returned to the past to reestablish the Darogha, a local police force in the Mughal Empire. They will be assigned to governors to be distributed as they see fit, within some parameters, and in more rural areas will effectively be the Government. As such, they shall undergo harsh vetting. In any case, we already have hundreds of them ready with thousands more on the way. "
AFG_mission_to_istanbul:0 "Reassert our Ties to Istanbul"
AFG_mission_to_istanbul_desc:0 "The Sultan in Istanbul is both Sultan of the last great Caliphate and the Caliph of all Islam. Nasrullah, as a deeply religious man, seeks to strengthen ties with the Porte. Not only is the Caliph a religious strongman, but his hold over the Middle East is tenuous but still undeniable. While the Dominion may be gearing up for another round of warfare, an alliance with Istanbul would strangle that hope in its cradle and make Afghanistan as peaceful as the Middle East!"
AFG_army_chief:0 "All for the Commander-in-Chief!"
AFG_army_chief_desc:0 "Most of the Army had long rallied behind their old Commander in Chief, however, the reformist officers and soldiers remained hesitant. However, with Nasrullah’s reign completely unchallenged and their leaders cowed or in hiding, more and more of them are switching sides. Now the Army stands totally united under their first Commander in Chief and devoted to the safety and preservation of Afghan sovereignty."

AFG_negotiate_with_the_wild_card_desc:0 "Nadir Shah is an outlier in the candidates for the throne. Having only lived in Afghanistan for a few decades, he spent most of his life in exile in India. That has made his true loyalties suspect. Until now he has made no real effort to take the throne but Nasrullah knows of his true ambitions, and the fact he plans on eventually acting on them. Nasrullah will bring Nadir to the table and get him to give up his claim and if he doesn't, who will miss one vanished exile?"
AFG_renounce_durand:0 "Thin out the Expedition"
AFG_renounce_durand_desc:0 "The German Expedition has remained in Afghanistan for too long. While the Kaiser’s help has been invaluable, his soldiers have begun to gather a clique of seditionists and fifth columnists around them seeking to draw Afghanistan closer to Berlin. This simply cannot continue. While it would be simple to expel them all, doing that would anger the Kaiser and alienate a good friend in times of crisis. Instead, Nasrullah will send a letter to the Kaiser and ask him politely to drawback most of the Expedition. The skeleton crew that remains will be useful to us while also being so hobbled as to not be a threat to Nasrullah’s rule."
AFG_the_soldier_emir:0 "The Soldier Emir"
AFG_the_soldier_emir_desc:0 "The Emir has and always will be closely tied to the military. He once ran it as its Commander in Chief, he led it in the battle against the decadent Raj while his elder brother drowned in decadence and now he leads it once more not as simply Commander in Chief, but Emir. His military victories and consolidation of the Army behind him have gained him the moniker, ‘the Soldier Emir’. While Nasrullah would have wanted a more pious decoration, even he is unable to say it's too far from the truth."
AFG_the_second_iron_emir:0 "The Second Iron Emir"
AFG_the_second_iron_emir_desc:0 "Nasrullah’s father Abdur Rahman Khan was called the Iron Emir for his harsh totalitarian rule. Under him there was no dissent, just determined citizens working to further Afghanistan. If Nasrullah is to achieve a lasting peace within his country then he must emulate his father in some respects."
AFG_aurangzeb:0 "Emulate Aurangzeb"
AFG_aurangzeb_desc:0 "The ancient Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb is known in the West as a religious tyrant and despot whose policies are looked upon...unfavorably. They are simply wrong, Aurangzeb was a pious man who wanted to bring his subjects eternal paradise by bringing them closer to Allah. Nasrullah knows this more than anybody and will seek to emulate him whenever possible. The spiritual health of the people is critical for the spiritual health of the nation."
AFG_aurangzeb_ornament:0 "Ornament of the Throne"
AFG_aurangzeb_ornament_desc:0 "Aurangzeb gained the nickname Ornament of the Throne for his successful economic policies that made India the largest economy on earth at the time, even surpassing Qing China. He even kickstarted a proto-Industrialization of Bengal. Nasrullah will emulate his success in Afghanistan. The economy is currently in tatters but Afghanistan is home to numerous valuable resources. By harnessing these resources and the various cottage industries across the nation the coffers will be restored and Afghanistan will not only know peace but prosperity."
AFG_aurangzeb_conquerer:0 "Conqueror of the World"
AFG_aurangzeb_conquerer_desc:0 "Aurangzeb is noted for his conquests of southern India. While in abstract comparison Nasrullah’s conquests are small, Afghanistan had still nearly doubled in size and had gained hundreds of thousands of new citizens. Nasrullah has done the impossible and broken the Durand Line and humbled India itself! With enough manpower behind him, there would be nothing that can stop him from whatever he may desire!"

Imperialists of the British and Indian flavors, Indian nationalists, and general dissenters of the Emir’s rule have made the area their home. Nasrullah has finally decided to do something about this and has ordered the Darogha to sweep the New Territories for potential trouble areas with orders to ‘deal with all problems promptly’. Reports of executions in the streets are already pouring in and are only expected to get more frequent."
AFG_fatawa:0 "The Fatawa 'Alamgiri"
AFG_fatawa_desc:0 "The Fatawa Alamgiri is a set of Sharia Law put in place by Aurangzeb throughout his Empire. Nasrullah has put forward a proposal to adopt a modified version of this for Afghanistan. This has caused some debate among his advisors. Those loyal to Nasrullah point out how it led the Mughal Empire under Aurangzeb to new heights economically and militarily while also keeping resistance to the Mughals repressed. They also point out that the Raj still uses a version of this as their own law. The proposal's enemies condemn it as too restrictive, too open to interpretation, and therefore unable to be properly enforced. However, it’s up to Nasrullah to decide."
AFG_sharia_administration:0 "Reimpose Sharia?"
AFG_sharia_administration_desc:0 "A proposal has come from Nasrullah to impose Sharia Law across all of Afghanistan. This has been met with both celebration from the Conservative elements of society and clerics while simultaneously enraging more liberal elements, particularly among these are the Hindus, an outspoken minority who has opposed Nasrullah since he took the throne. If we go through with this they will surely fight back. Ultimately, it’s up for Nasrullah to decide."
AFG_return_of_jizya:0 "The Gold Must Flow!"
AFG_return_of_jizya_desc:0 "For any state to function it must collect its taxes. The ruggedness of Afghanistan has made this an issue for every one of its rulers. Nasrullah is determined to overcome this hurdle. A new system of tax collection will be instituted to ensure all of Afghanistan’s subjects pay their due to the Crown so the state may be properly maintained. This will cause considerable grumbling, especially among the tribes who were able to slip away from taxes for so long, but that is the price we must pay."
AFG_polish_the_jewel:0 "Polish the Jewel"

By direct investments, we will slowly intertwine these new areas into their new homeland and buy the goodwill of the locals. It will take a while and the locals will likely hinder our every effort, but it’s an effort that must be expended if all of Afghanistan is to be one."
AFG_patronize_works:0 "Facilitate Spread of Islamic Culture"
AFG_patronize_works_desc:0 "Afghanistan is a mix of Indian, Central Asian, Islamic, and even remnant Greek culture. This cultural disunity cannot stand if Afghanistan is to continue to function. Nasrullah will set up a Department of Islamic Culture to promote and encourage Islamic culture in the areas it is weakest. New Islamic newspapers will be printed, Islamic will replace local languages, and monuments to non-Islamic heroes will be replaced or overshadowed by new ones. This is a heavy step to take, to suppress dissenting cultures in favor of our own, but the hardest choices take the strongest wills."
AFG_temperance_in_rule:0 "A Rule of Piety and Temperance"
AFG_temperance_in_rule_desc:0 "Aurangzeb was a deeply pious man, much like Nasrullah, and he cut down on the pomp and circumstance of the Mughal Court to donate more to charity and local mosques. Nasrullah, emulating this great man, will do the same. The decadence of his predecessor will be curtailed and the money saved will be donated to the newly established Afghan Prosperity Fund and to mosques. Some will accuse Nasrullah of donating to Mosques to reward his cleric allies. Nasrullah has no comment on such baseless accusations."

Once loyal citizens of the Empire have been poisoned by independence activists who only seek to destroy our Empire from the inside. Left with no other options, the Governor-General has decided that only our loyal government can restore order to Delhi and save India from itself. While many are reluctant to fight against our own brothers, it is imperative that the Crown Jewel must not fall into the hands of the enemy."

AFG_gun_grabbing:0 "Disarm the Rebels"
AFG_gun_grabbing_desc:0 "One of the biggest hurdles towards securing our rule over the Afghan tribes has been the prevalence of arms trafficking within the region. Located within the Khyber Pass, these crafty gunsmiths have used scavenged metals to create convincing copies of our own weaponry. While not particularly reliable, these smiths can easily mass produce and hand-me-down ‘Khyber Pass copies’ that could easily fall into the hands of dangerous insurgents. To prevent a future revolt, an expeditionary force will be sent down the Khyber to seize any and all counterfeit weapons."

AFG_bribe_local_leaders:0 "Pay Off Tribal Leaders"
AFG_bribe_local_leaders_desc:0 "Afghanistan has never been a unified nation in any sense of the word, it is a loose band of tribal chiefs operating under the nominal rule of the former Emir. For centuries these warlords have vied for wealth and power, scheming against one another to come out on top. We shall make contact with any willing local collaborators to bring them under our wing. These tribal leaders will be provided with expensive gifts and lofty administrative positions as long as they affirm their loyalty to the Empire."

AFG_guaranteed_loyalty:0 "Ensure Local Loyalty"
AFG_guaranteed_loyalty_desc:0 "While we continue to reap the benefits of collaboration with loyal chiefs, there remain dissidents who still foolishly fight against our rule. We  must make an example of these unruly tribes before they can band together against our administration. We will play into the divisions prevalent within Afghan society and pit the squabbling tribes against each other while propping up our loyal allies."

AFG_british_code:0 "Enshrine Common Law"
AFG_british_code_desc:0 "As we move to eradicate lawlessness in Afghanistan, we must acknowledge that the Afghan nation has barely known law. In 1880, Abdur Rahman Khan, the father of Habibullah Khan, had established the nation’s first codified law and justice system. The Afghan justice system, however, plays second fiddle to Sharia courts and that is prevalent throughout the countryside. Habibullah’s attempts to expand the legal system were quickly stamped out by traditionalists within Afghan society. We will replace the Emir’s attempts at judicial reform with the time-tested methods of English law. While not phasing out the Sharia courts entirely, the reaches of our jurisdiction will be greatly expanded upon."

AFG_no_reforms:0 "A 'Hands Off' Approach"
AFG_no_reforms_desc:0 "Let it be known to the average Afghan that their way of life will not be altered by being under the administration of the Empire, in fact it will only improve. Afghanistan’s deep rooted tribal structure will remain in place (if they remain loyal to us) and we will make no attempts to hamper the Islamic faith in the region. In addition, we will show the Afghan people the potential benefits of collaboration through promoting military service and work opportunities."

AFG_part_of_the_empire:0 "Our Place in the Empire"
AFG_part_of_the_empire_desc:0 "We stand at a critical point for the future for not only Afghanistan but the Empire as a whole. As we come to decide our Dominion’s destiny, two vastly different approaches have emerged within our administration. Most within our government have supported using what resources Afghanistan has to aid in the reconquest of India and the reclamation of the Home Isles. Some influential imperialists, however, have drafted up their own proposals to bring the entirety of the Near East under the British boot, drawing in new resources to bring prosperity to the Empire. We must decide carefully how to best use these mountains to serve the Empire."

AFG_gateway_of_east:0 "Gateway to the Near East"
AFG_gateway_of_east_desc:0 "With our rule over the nation absolute, we now stand in a position to carry out our plans to use Afghanistan as a springboard to expand the Empire’s influence throughout not only the Near East, but Asia as a whole. In the north, the Russians have lost their grasp over Turkestan. In the west, the crumbling Ottoman Empire is threatened by revolts and an all out invasion by neighboring states. This chaotic situation will be played to our advantage, allowing us to quickly expand our influence across Asia and bring an end to the Great Game once and for all."
