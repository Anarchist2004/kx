afghanredux.0.t:0 "The Graveyard of Empires Stirs"
afghanredux.0.d:0 "Much has changed for the Emirate of Afghanistan since the turn of the century. Habibullāh Khan’s reign initially endeavored to push his once reformative agenda into practice despite resistance from the nation’s many entrenched conservative sources of influence. Despite this, Afghanistan has seen some progress, with its legal, economic and educational systems all receiving minorly beneficial reforms, but above all, no institution within our Emirate has flourished like our military has, with Habibullāh passing a slew of new laws to improve the Afghan Army. This military prowess was built up as the earliest years of the new century dragged on until the Weltkrieg broke out in 1914. \n\nAs the horrific Weltkrieg dragged on, Afghanistan was put under increasing pressure from both the Kaiserreich and the Ottoman Empire to join the conflict on their behalf. Initially, Habibullāh resisted these calls for war, instead turning inward as he focused on ruling his own kingdom sealed away from the wider world. However, this peace would be shattered in 1917, when a band of tribes rallied by Nasrullah Khan and Ghāzī Amānullāh Khān disobeyed all previous orders and took a secretive gamble to push into British India without informing their Emir. Without support from the wider armed forces, Amānullāh’s forces were disastrously beaten and quickly forced back into Afghani territory, dragging the nation into the Weltkrieg and sparking a third war between us and the Anglos ... \n\nTwo years prior, the Kaiserreich established the Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition, a military attache aimed at training, supplying, and otherwise aiding the Afghani forces for a surprise attack against the Ango-Indian forces. Eventually, the cacophony of the Weltkrieg drew silent, and Afghanistan stood on the side of the victors.\n\nAs the decades since that horrific conflict have worn on, Habibullāh’s rule has only drifted further from his original ideals as he grows lazier and more opulent with age. It is now 1936, and the German mission is still here, Habibullāh still lounges on his throne, and our Emirate is as unstable as ever. The constant meddling of the Kaiser’s expeditionary force has only driven up unrest, regardless of the military benefits it has provided, and this chaotic situation has only been stoked by the rising radicalism being proliferated within the Provisional Government of India which we have so generously harbored. The Young Afghans, a local nationalist movement, grow increasingly vocal over their displeasure with Habibullāh’s rule, and the Emir’s two main rivals of Amānullāh and Nasrullah are at each other’s throats, each vying for their seat on Habibullāh’s throne. The aging Emir is growing desperate to keep his seat of power intact, and some whisper that he is even willing to start another war to do it. The nation of Afghanistan is once again on the edge of great change or utter collapse, and only Allah knows which way it will fall."

afghanredux.1.t.defeat:0 "King Habibullah has fled the country!"
afghanredux.1.d.victory:0 "After our brilliant victory against the vile and treacherous British and their pawns of the Delhi Dominion, thus proving once again Afghanistan's nickname of Graveyards of Empire, the power and popularity of our great king has never been higher. The previously disunited tribes now find unity in the pride of the newfound Afghan power and the many plots against our sovereign seem to have dissipated. It was decided to organize a great and sumptuous parade in the streets of Kabul, with a huge crowd and all the tribal and political representatives of the country present during the event. At the end of the parade, King Ghazi Habibullah Khan delivered a speech to his people praising the merits of Afghanistan's modernization and its proud army during the Fifth Anglo-Afghan War. To the surprise of his people, the King announced the formation of a new Barakzai Empire, risen from the ashes of the Durrani and Mughals, and that he would lead it to greatness. He left the stage to the loud applause of both his people and the tribal leaders.\n\nMeanwhile in Delhi, news of the announcement of 'Mughal ambitions' has shaken the government to its core. Communications between Delhi and Ottawa are frantic. Fear of another invasion, one which could see the complete annexation of the Raj, has paralyzed the British administration. The Entente's grip over India seems to be at its lowest point yet."
afghanredux.1.d.defeat:0 "After our humiliating defeat against the British forces in the Fifth Anglo-Afghan War, the position of King Habibullah had never been so precarious and fragile, the numerous conspiracies against him by the tribal lords and even some members of the government intensified greatly. The tribal instability in our country has also greatly increased as Afghan national pride has been torn to shreds and a strong resentment against the King is felt among the population. Undoubtedly because of these factors, having failed to modernize Afghanistan and lead it to glory, and fearing for his life, our King fled the country in the early hours of the morning with some of his relatives and much of the treasury. This flight did not help the stability of the country, which is on the verge of chaos as conflicts spark between various political factions each wanting more control. The future of Afghanistan is grim."

afghanredux.2.t:0 "The Graveyard of Empires Stirs"
afghanredux.2.d:0 "As the Anglo-Afghan War rages on, Kabul has come to us requesting planes and a contingent of elite troops to aid them in defeating the British Indians in Delhi. The war is hotly contested right now, with both sides having a fair chance at victory. Our support could help tip the balance in favor of the Afghans, especially in the battle for the air. Since Afghanistan and the German Empire are on friendly terms, helping the Afghans out would reaffirm our ties and further improve relations. In addition, such a move would surely come as a snub to the Canadians, something that is always welcome by the German people. However, with Black Monday currently ravaging our economy and the Empire having bigger problems to deal with than Afghanistan's distant wars, perhaps it might be best to keep the planes and men to ourselves. Some have pointed out that while it would be nice to have a strong friend in the region, supporting the Afghans comes with the risk of upsetting the Canadians at a time when their new King provides an opportunity for renewed relations, and would undoubtedly hurt us in the long run should Delhi emerge victorious. We must choose carefully..."
afghanredux.2.a:0 "We shall support our friends in Kabul, send the planes and boys over!"
afghanredux.2.b:0 "We sympathize with Afghanistan's struggle, but we simply cannot aid them at this time."

afghanredux.3.t:0 "A Visit from Friends in Kabul"
afghanredux.3.d:0 "We have received a message from Kabul asking for our Sultan, the Caliph, to declare a jihad against the Raj. The Emir is currently doing battle with the full fighting force of the imperial dogs in the Entente and is requesting our support. If we were to do this, loyal servants of Allah from around the world would rally behind the banners of the Barakzai dynasty. They claim if we do they would have both Allah and the faithful mujahideen on their side, meaning they couldn’t fail. The Caliph is wary of picking sides in the Indian subcontinent, but the rewards would be great if he were to gain a loyal ally at the crossroads of the World. What will the Caliph decide is the right course?"
afghanredux.3.a:0 "I declare a Jihad for Delhi!"
afghanredux.3.b:0 "They will win without our help, Inshallah."

afghanredux.4.t:0 "The Emir Requests Arms!"
afghanredux.4.d:0 "We have received a message from the far-off land of Afghanistan asking for weapons to fight the British Raj. Some of our advisors say we should send them at once, as an Afghan victory would be a deep bruise to the Entente. The Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition, after all, is still in the Graveyard of Empires, and increased funding and support to them wouldn’t be a gargantuan task. Others, however, remind the Kaiser that the Entente is currently in exile, and we have more present enemies just across the border to the West. There are more pressing enemies than our old grudges, some say. What shall we do?"
afghanredux.4.a:0 "In the spirit of 1914, we shall help Afghanistan."
afghanredux.4.b:0 "We must focus on the threats at home first."

afghanredux.5.t:0 "The Emir Requests Arms!"
afghanredux.5.d:0 "Our friends in Afghanistan have asked us for weapons to fight their war. The war between our friends and the Anglo dogs still rages as fighting stretches for hundreds of miles across their borders. Some of our military advisors urge us to accept in the name of Muslim solidarity and to use this as another way to get back at the perfidious Brits. Others however remind us of the unrest currently gripping the Middle East and urge the Sultan to keep all his resources focused on the enemies closer to encroaching on our influence."
afghanredux.5.a:0 "These weapons are dedicated to the brave Mujahideen fighters of Afghanistan."
afghanredux.5.b:0 "They don't need us anymore."

afghanredux.6.t:0 "Movements from the Himalayas!"
afghanredux.6.d:0 "Shimla has been seized by the Nepalese! The disorganized British garrison was routed nearly instantly by the invading mountain men, as their recent defeat has shaken their military apparatus to its rotten core. Delhi is rattled even more as their mandate shrinks even more with a relative blink of the eye. While this poses no real threat to us it does mean Nepalese troops are now on our borders. We have no quarrel with the Nepalese, for now. It would be wise for them to not further encroach on our new conquest."
afghanredux.6.a:0 "Keep an eye on them."

afghanredux.9.t:0 "Amanullah in Istanbul"
afghanredux.9.d:0 "Amanullah Khan, son of Habibullah, arrived in Istanbul earlier today. When Amanullah landed in Istanbul, he was immediately taken aback by its glory and grandeur. The Queen of Cities easily lives up to her name. He is greeted by a government delegation with a smart and clean honor guard and is first taken around the city for a few hours as the Sultan is said to be asleep. He eats the best food he has in some time, visited numerous historical sights, answered questions asked by throngs of foreign reporters, and finally has his midday prayers in the Hagia Sophia. When he is done he is taken to the Sultan and the two hit it off well. The Sultan asks about the War and how Afghanistan is doing while Amanullah asks about how the Sublime Porte fares in turn. The Sultan pledged to provide support to the Afghan cause by any means necessary, and in turn, humbly requests support. Many in the Royal Court, the Caliph included, believe war may be coming to the Ottoman sphere of influence. The Emir’s son pledged to support the Caliph in any way he could. Amanullah then watched the Palace Guard execute parade maneuvers in the courtyard and appeared thoroughly impressed. Such discipline! Such fervor! He was seen off by the Sultan himself, and as Amanullah sits down in his plane, all consider the visit between the two as a great success. Hopefully, the friendship between our two great nations never dies!"
afghanredux.9.a:0 "The Sick Man doesn't seem so sick to me"

afghanredux.10.t:0 "Amanullah in Tehran"
afghanredux.10.d:0 "Amanullah lands in Tehran for another royal visit and is immediately put off by how demonstrably hot it is. When he exits his plane he finds not a grand delegation as he met elsewhere, but a small group of politicians with a small guard. They explain that the government is tied up elsewhere and as such, they were all who could meet him. He is ferried around the city and enjoys it despite his company. Finally, he is flown to Qoms where he observes a grand military parade followed by an inspection. Amanullah notes the disheveled looks of some of the soldiers and their disorganization despite the shouts of their commanders. The men are all too sloppy; their uniforms are the wrong size and they conduct their military drills and maneuvers without tempo or panache. During his inspection of what was heralded as an 'elite' division, a soldier further down the line drops his rifle and it goes off, shooting himself in the foot. The Prince is insulted by such a shoddy reception but does his best to contain his dissatisfaction. When he returns to the plane he is all too happy to be out of Tehran."
afghanredux.10.a:0 "They think they can run the Middle East better than the Turks?"

afghanredux.11.t:0 "Amanullah Returns"
afghanredux.11.d:0 "When Amanullah returns to Kabul he returns a changed man. He looks out on the capital he left no longer content with its vistas. He saw the magnificence of Istanbul and the squalor of Tehran and is ashamed to see Kabul looking like the latter rather than the former. He is also all too aware of the state of his military before the War and his visit to the Ottomans has given him some ideas as to how to improve his situation. While Amanullah is not first in line to receive the throne, should his father abdicate or be rendered incapable, he is a man of ambition. His uncle, Nasrullah, is a reactionary man, who would rather see Afghanistan wallow in the same troubles that have been affecting it for centuries instead of dragging it into the future. A foolish agenda! Amanullah Khan, one way or another, will have his throne, and he will force Afghanistan, one way or another, into the modern world."
afghanredux.11.a:0 "I found Kabul a city of mud, I shall leave it a city of gold."

afghanredux.12.t:0 "The Khan Prospers"
afghanredux.12.d:0 "People are happy, dissent is nonexistent and the Emir’s power has never been stronger. Before a generally hated man, the Emir has seen a wave of popularity that his rule has never before seen. While the state of our rule before the war was a little shaky, things have improved, as Habibullah's gambit has proven to be successful. The risk has paid off. What could go wrong?"
afghanredux.12.a:0 "The Afghan Golden Age begins now!"


afghanredux.13.t:0 "A Royal Hunt"
afghanredux.13.d:0 "A three days drive northwest of Kabul, deep into the heart of the western range of the Hindu Kush, and beyond the extent of the Kahmard district lies the Ajar Valley. Prized for its isolation, its pristine and unspoiled natural beauty, and its ample hunting grounds, this isolated and forgotten cut has long been the well-kept secret of Afghani nobles and royals seeking a bountiful foray into the wilds. First traveling here what must be years ago by now with Mohammed Zahir, who has long used this gorge as his own personal plot to hunt the varied beasts of our lands, our king Habibullah and his most trusted confidants have frequently used this strip of wilderness to clear the mind, to discuss politics or matters of the state in private, or even to just take an occasional break from the rigors of rule and statecraft. \n\nThis hunting trip was no different, with Habibullah and his retinue leaving their horses back at the entrance of the pass where a small rest shack stood, continuing deeper into the wilds on foot. Bringing with them only a small amount of survival supplies, their traditional jezails with ample shot and powder, and other various supplies needed for the hunt such as bait and skinning knives, the royal retinue embarked deep into the heart of this ‘Valley of the King’ in search of noble prey such as wild boar, ibex, antelope, markhor, and if they were so lucky, even snow leopard and Asiatic cheetah. As the sun rose high in the arid and crisply blue sky, their multi-day hunt began with their guards lowered and their spirits high, for it's not like anything ever goes awry this far from the causticness of civilization..."
afghanredux.13.a:0 "Hunting is badass!"

afghanredux.14.t:0 "Disaster Strikes the Hunting Party!"
afghanredux.14.d:0 "It all happened so fast, and without any warning or time to think, but tragedy struck and now our glorious King Habibullah lies dead at the base of the Ajar Valley. \n\nWhile hunting through the rocky crag of the pass on the final day of the hunting trip, their party came across a fabled and magnificent snow leopard silently making its way up the rockface to some unseen cave or den. \n\nDespite the ample amount of antelope and other beasts the party had slain, this final quarry would be the perfect cap to an already amazing venture. However, fate had other plans, and as the retinue scrambled their way up the mountain, disaster struck. With the snow leopard finally catching the hunters’ scent as the wind shifted, the stark white feline bolted, causing the hunting party to attempt to chase after it. However, one of the nobles on the trip with Habibullah lost his footing on the rock face above the king, slipping down the cliff face by a few meters before regaining his grip. Thinking the worst was behind them and disaster was just avoided, the small sighs of relief and quiet cheers ended abruptly when the sound of gunfire cut through the valley. Turning back in horror, Habibullah’s men saw the jezail fall from the slipping noble’s back, hitting the sound of the mountain and misfiring directly into the face of their king. In an explosion of pink mist and grey smoke, a hole the size of a softball was blown through the head of Habibullah, sending the honored king tumbling down to the valley floor, leaving a red trail behind him as he plummeted lifelessly to the ground. As his men quickly repelled down the mountain rushing to the aid of their wounded king, it was far too late to save him by the time they reached his side. Managing to gurgle out a swift goodbye through the blood filling his lungs and throat before finally passing, Habibullah died on the floor of the valley surrounded by some of his closest allies. \n\nA tragic accident if ever there was one, the men wrapped the king’s body in gauze and prepared to take him back to Kabul, dreading having to break it to the nation that the king was well and truly dead. Though all in the retinue understood clearly that this was an accident in every sense of the word, the more cynical within the group believed that upon their return, accusations would begin to fly as rival groups vying for power each start to throw blame on one another. Whatever awaited them in Kabul, they would soon see, but the trek back was sure to be a solemn one."
afghanredux.14.a:0 "A dark star rises over the nation as its beloved King lay bleeding out."


afghanredux.15.t:0 "The Ascension of the Crown Prince"
afghanredux.15.d:0 "While the country mourns the death of Habibullah the ship of state must move forwards. Nasrullah, the designated heir to Habibullah, is already planning his coronation but some clamor for an investigation into the death of the beloved former Emir, especially since Nasrullah seems a bit apathetic about his brother's death. While some attribute this to the new Emir's solemn personality, others suspect foul play. Nasrullah was never the power-hungry man, but a majority of the public is unaware of the man's personality. Yet, prominent figures in the military are divided in their support for the new Emir, and some fear another conflict so soon. Nasrullah must make a decision to either submit to investigation or resist it."
afghanredux.15.a:0 "I have nothing to fear from baseless claims."
afghanredux.15.b:0 "Shut them down now!"

afghanredux.16.t:0 "Nasrullah Arrested"
afghanredux.16.d:0 "Treachery! We have found evidence that Nasrullah engineered the death of our beloved Emir! Amanullah Khan has already gathered a loyal faction of the Army and marched on Kabul and arrested the traitorous Nasrullah. While the manufactured evidence was shoddy at best, it was more than enough to try and imprison the Crown Prince. Besides, no one would question the integrity of our operation, anyway. With Nasrullah thrown in jail for the foreseeable future, the crown falls to Amanullah’s lap."
afghanredux.16.a:0 "Long live Ghazi Amanullah Khan!"

afghanredux.17.t:0 "A Split in the Army"
afghanredux.17.d:0 "The recent death of Habibullah Khan and the subsequent controversy surrounding his death has caused a rift in the Army. With the two men vying for the throne, Nasrullah and Amanullah Khan, being career military men, the Army has begun to choose sides between the two candidates. More traditional sects have sided with Nasrullah while the progressive factions within it have fallen in behind Amanullah. One however has managed to seize the lion's share and forced the other army group to stand down. Who has won out in the end?"
afghanredux.17.a:0 "Amanullah Khan's upstarts in the Army prevail."
afghanredux.17.b:0 "The Old Order holds as the Army stands by the Commander-in-Chief."

afghanredux.18.t:0 "Amanullah Flees into Exile"
afghanredux.18.d:0 "Amanullah’s coup attempt has collapsed under its own falsehoods and Nasrullah has been freed and restored to power. While Amanullah has fled to Switzerland, there are still many within the Army who support him. The influence of the Young Afghans is still strong and it is almost certain that they will oppose the rightful Emir with everything they have. If he were to ever return they would be a potentially fatal fifth column. What are we to do with them?"
afghanredux.18.a:0 "Without the head, the snake will die."
afghanredux.18.b:0 "Leave nothing to chance!"

afghanredux.19.t:0 "Nasrullah Wins!"
afghanredux.19.d:0 "Nasrullah Khan has consolidated his rule against all opposition. His opponents on all sides have been broken, killed, or forced into hiding. The Traitor Prince, Amanullah, has fled the country, and his support is dwindling even amongst the Young Afghans. The Army is fiercely loyal to its new Emir, and Nasrullah is riding a wave of popularity began by his late brother. Other dissidents have been forced into the mountains, where they will starve and dwindle away. Now there is nothing standing between the Emir and his vision for Afghanistan. The worst is behind us."
afghanredux.19.a:0 "Excellent!"

afghanredux.20.t:0 "Nadir Shah Plays His Hand"
afghanredux.20.d:0 "Mohammed Nadir Shah, a relative outsider in the Royal Family, has marched on Kabul and deposed Nasrullah. The purge backfired and rather than be killed or fired, the enemies of Nasrullah flocked to Shah’s banner. Many were unjustly targeted during the purge, and Nasrullah has more enemies than friends he can depend on. Now, the Afghan Wild Card is in control of the country and there are few left to challenge him. While his vision for Afghanistan is still hazy, many are hesitant to support him due to his old ties to the British. One thing is clear, however: Nadir Shah is here to stay with most of the military at his back."
afghanredux.20.a:0 "A new man for a new Afghanistan."

afghanredux.21.t:0 "The Luftexpedition Arrives!"
afghanredux.21.d:0 "The Germans have sent help! The so called Luftexpedition has arrived in Kabul to seemingly an equal amount of cheers and jeers. The roar of a regiment of the finest planes of the world is such a beautiful sound! These German air wings and volunteers have been drilled in desert warfare during a stopover in Aleppo and, as such, are not totally out of their element. However, there was a mishap, as a German bomber bounced off of the makeshift airbase in Kabul before crashing to the ground. The plane's landing gear was ripped off by the bumpy and uneven surface before the nose was sent careening into the dirt. \n\nIn any case, German advisors are already discussing with our military brass on how to best utilize the expedition. While a group centered around the remnants of the newly revitalized Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition have welcomed these pasty white men with open arms, traditional elements within our nation still regard them with suspicion. Habibullah has built the reputation of being the lapdop of the Hun, and the new developments within our Emirate seem to confirm such a tale. It remains to be seen whether the German elements within our nation will lead to victory or disgrace."
afghanredux.21.a:0 "Willkommen Waffenbrüder!"

afghanredux.22.t:0 "Jihad!"
afghanredux.22.d:0 "In an address from Constantinople, the Caliph has declared that our war against the Raj as a jihad to free the shackled faithful under British imperialism. To jubilant Ottoman crowds, the Sultan [OTT.GetLeader] unleashed a tirade against the centuries-long British yoke under the Indian subcontinent and demanded that self determination be granted to the Indian population. This has been an immediate boon to our efforts as pious Muslims from across the region and in fact the world have begun to arrive in Kabul to join our struggle. Our airports and travel stops are overrun by pilgrims and warriors who seek Allah's glory by supporting our struggle. However, a countermovement led by the Emir of Mecca have decried this as a purely political maneuver by the Sultan to gain influence in the region, and the Ottoman rivals in Cairo have condemned the Caliph's actions. Political play or not, the results are undeniable, as warriors from around the Islamic world come to our aid."
afghanredux.22.a:0 "Inshallah."

afghanredux.23.t:0 "German Resources Arrive!"
afghanredux.23.d:0 "Rifles by the crate, ammo by the box and artillery by the pallet. All arrive in Kabul airport aboard German planes. The almost state of the art weapons of war are a far cry from what we were using previously and as such our men will require a lot of retraining to properly use them. Despite this we can now fight on more equal terms with our enemy and have a greater chance of victory."
afghanredux.23.a:0 "Maybe, one day, we can repay them."

afghanredux.24.t:0 "The Turks Send Arms!"
afghanredux.24.d:0 "As our troops pour over the crates of rifles and masses of artillery they are awed by their craftsmanship. The Turks promised us weapons and they have delivered in spades. We have begun to immediately disperse them to our soldiers on the Front and with these weapons straight from the Caliph, Allah will surely look upon us favorably."
afghanredux.24.a:0 "Allahu Akbar!"

afghanredux.25.t:0 "Send in the Hounds!"
afghanredux.25.d:0 "Not all Indians accept the rule of the Raj. Within our nation resides the Provisional Government of India, a native resistance group dedicated to finishing the destruction of the Raj. We have given the refuge in our nation long ago; however, they have long wasted away in exile, never finding an opportunity to strike at the Raj nor return home. Now with war having broken out we have finally found a reason to use them. They shall be smuggled back into their homeland to commit acts of sabotage and riotous sedition to divide our enemies' attention. The Raj, for all their faults, are much bigger than us and with their undivided attention we will surely fail. With them feeling the heat of their new fire in the rear, however, we will surely gain our righteous victory. Who knows, maybe they will even gain power in the ruins of the Raj!"
afghanredux.25.a:0 "United against Imperialism!"

afghanredux.26.t:0 "The Coronation of Nasrullah Khan"
afghanredux.26.d:0 "Nasrullah receives his crown as Emir. mf is dripped out to the max. Whole lotta hoopla (a lot). Mohammed Nadir Shah is invited as an olive branch to a political rival. The Ottoman sultan sends a delegation to deliver gifts to the new emir, and many tribal leaders are invited to the event, to which they agree. Perhaps, this is a new era of tribal peace and prosperity, as Nasrullah looks to settle internal strife and dissent among his new people."
afghanredux.26.a:0 "The Shahzada has finally ascended!"


afghanredux.1000.t:0 "A Prospect for Treasure"
afghanredux.1000.d:0 "Lying outside of Jalalabad, the Spin Ghar, or the White Mountains, is a mountain range in South Asia to the south of the Hindu Kush. Home to the famous Khyber Pass, most of the mountain chain reaches through our glorious nation. The range extends from the Peshawar valley in the east about 160 kilometers west to the Logar valley in Afghanistan, with the Kabul River cutting a narrow trough through the Spīn Ghar mountains to flow eastward into the Indus River. Verdant wildlife, from endangered birds to mulberry orchards call the chain home.\n\nRecently, our resource prospectors have found titanic deposits of valuable minerals underneath Mount Sikarim, known locally as Sacum. The Mountain and the area surrounding it is rich in tungsten, limestone, lithium, and, most interestingly, platinum. If we were able to harvest all of these bountiful minerals and resources, we would surely give our burgeoning economy a sizable boost. [ROOT.GetLeaderName] has already agreed to an operation to mine the mountain, despite the protests from environmentalists. However, there remains an issue.\n\nThe herculean efforts to modernize our country from the tribal fiefdoms that have lasted for millennia is continuing swimmingly, but like all progress, takes time. The technology required to dig deep enough and gain access to the mineral deposits are all too far away from reality for us. It would require the entire dismantlement of the mountain, which most are convinced is impossible. However, some are not convinced of the futility of such a prospect.\n\nWith our imports of armaments, munitions, and other military equipment from our benefactor, we are steadily bridging the gap between our army and the standard of the world. This development means we have powerful artillery ordinance that is actually more effective than most of the blast charges we have at the moment. Some within the army plan to actually use these cannons to split the earth and slowly chip away at the mountain until its rich underbelly is revealed for us to extract. Many within the government have laughed in the face of such a plan, but the economy is desperate for a stimulus. After all, it might work, no?"

Afghanistan is one of the most unconquerable places in the world, and our people are not easy to sway either.

AFG_tribal_equipment_desc:0 "It is no secret that our relative isolation from the rest of the world has resulted in us lagging greatly behind the other regional and world powers in the realm of military technology. While Afghanistan has had a martial tradition for milennia, modern war has no need for the valor of men. Instead, war demands brain and metal more than blood. Most of our standing army is reliant on levies from the various tribes under our rule, and almost all of them are severely lacking in equipment, with many preferring the ancestral jezail flintlock than a standard issue rifle. This stagnation means that our armies are often underequipped and will likely crumble in the face of a modernized adversary."

Dissent amongst Muslims living in the British Raj have swirled for generations and culminated when large groups of Muslim Indians refused to fight the Ottoman Empire, resisting British mandates. With the British resorting to mass arrests and displacements, many Muslims sought refuge in Kabul, to which the Emir has generously granted. For nearly 20 years, we have been a save haven for the followers of Allah in the Indian Subcontinent, but our administration is severely weakened due to the constant influx of immigrants, with much of the populace displeased."

With the Emir seeing the blood in the water, Afghanistan joined Germany and the Ottoman Empire to shatter Entente influence in the Levant, Arabian Peninsula, and Indian Subcontinent.

AFG_growing_tensions_desc:0 "The Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition has been both a blessing and a curse. Their expertise and support saw our victory and independence achieved in the 3rd Anglo-Afghan War. However, the instability brought by German influence and lobbying and the Indian Provisional Government's radicalism has begun to reach a crisis point. With every day that passes, support for the Young Afghans and a war to destroy the British Raj grows. With every day that passes, whispers of treason against the Emir become more and more common. They say that the Emir has grown fat, lazy, complacent. They say that he is no longer even Muslim, that he plans to subvert Islam and destroy Afghan traditions. They say he is nothing more than a German puppet.\n\nEven if our army is in shambles, we have no choice. We must go to war against the British Raj, lest the house of cards comes crashing down."

His enemies still circle, waiting for their time to strike but they will be dealt with in time. Its up to the new Emir to decide the future fate of Afghanistan. While its impossible to say what Nasrullah will do, his almost unmatched zealotry, love of tradition, and alliance with the conservative religious elements of society can give the world a hint as to what the future holds for the country."
AFG_mourn_habibullah:0 "Settle Tribal Feuds"
AFG_mourn_habibullah_desc:0 "The decadence of Habibullah and his push of Western reforms enraged the conservative tribes of Afghanistan’s hinterlands. They have been in rebellion for years now, left to run riot over the countryside while the Emir in Kabul counts his wives. Now however their only ally in the Royal Family, Nasrullah, has taken the throne and he has called a conference in Kabul to settle the Tribes' grievances and end their incessant fighting."
AFG_nasrullah_rules:0 "Finalize the Ascension"
AFG_nasrullah_rules_desc:0 "Nasrullah has done it and secured his position as Emir. With the Conservatives rallying behind the new Emir their great influence over the country has begun to be exerted in Nasrullah’s favor. Rival factions, claimants and disgruntled citizenry are slowly dispersing as their support evaporates behind this groundswell of support for Nasrullah. With his throne secure however, Nasrullah can really get down to business."
AFG_consolidate_rule:0 "Bring Unity to the Empire"
AFG_consolidate_rule_desc:0 "The instability that has plagued the Emirate has to come to an end if Afghanistan is to thrive. Various rebellions of equally various sizes still roam the countryside, taking advantage of the near-anarchy ushered in by the chaos of Habibullah’s death. While Nasrullah is kind to his friends, these rebels are not his friends. All available military force will be used to disperse these rebels and finally unify the state."
AFG_arrest_opposition:0 "End the Banditry"
AFG_arrest_opposition_desc:0 "The Afghan countryside is almost tailor-made for bandits. Most of the country is an elaborate labyrinth of caves and mountains. It will be hard work, but these mountains must be finely combed to smoke out any remaining bandits who wish to make an easy profit. We have found an especially prolific bandit already, holed up in Tora Bora."
AFG_seize_press:0 "Oversee the Press"
AFG_seize_press_desc:0 "Afghanistan does not have a lot of press outlets already, and most of those we do have are printed. While Nasrullah respects the press and values their independence, he cannot let them run amok. If they print falsehoods, they could destabilize the Emirate and throw the nation into chaos. To remedy this, Nasrullah will invite the heads of the largest media companies in the country to meet with him. They won't be outright censored per se, but Nasrullah will make it clear that any falseness will be punished. Severely."
AFG_find_amanullah:0 "Put an End to the Young Afghans!"
AFG_find_amanullah_desc:0 "The so-called ‘Young Afghans’ don't know what's good for them! They seek progress and modernity in the face of all of its hazards! We saw what happened when their progenitor, the Young Turks, took over the Sublime Porte. The group is already reeling from the exile of their man in the Royal Family, Amanullah. Nasrullah has ordered the police and army to launch a series of raids on known Young Afghan hideouts and ordered its leaders arrested. With their leaders gone, the wayward souls will return to the fold and be welcomed."
AFG_reverse_secularization:0 "Reverse Secularization"
AFG_reverse_secularization_desc:0 "Habibullah made great strides in many things, and probably the most egregious was the increased secularization of Afghanistan. The Emirate is tied fundamentally to Allah, so Habibullah’s attempts to separate the two are simply laughable. Nasrullah, with the support of his cleric allies, will begin to undo these ‘reforms’ and make Afghanistan right once more. We will mesh our state into its fundamental religion so much that to try and separate the two once more would be impossible. "
AFG_the_afghan_journeyman:0 "Regarding the Brigand King"
AFG_the_afghan_journeyman_desc:0 "The most notorious of the bandit rebels is Habibullah Kalakani. He and his zealots continue to be a thorn in our side trying to pull our nation even further to the right. However, while some in our military and government want us to outright destroy him, Nasrullah remains hesitant. While Kalakani at his most radical is little more than a despot, some of his less radical positions are not too different from Nasrullah, and rumor has it that there are talks between him and the bandit king."
AFG_traditional_roles:0 "Re-establish the Darogha"
AFG_traditional_roles_desc:0 "Afghanistan is a land that almost refuses to be ruled. Its ruggedness and rural nature makes any central control difficult. Our additions in India only magnify this problem. To better control the rabble Nasrullah has returned to the past to reestablish the Darogha, a local police force in the Mughal Empire. They will be assigned to governors to be distributed as they see fit, within some parameters, and in more rural areas will effectively be the Government. As such, they shall undergo harsh vetting. In any case, we already have hundreds of them ready with thousands more on the way. "
AFG_mission_to_istanbul:0 "Reassert our Ties to Istanbul"
AFG_mission_to_istanbul_desc:0 "The Sultan in Istanbul is both Sultan of the last great Caliphate and the Caliph of all Islam. Nasrullah, as a deeply religious man, seeks to strengthen ties with the Porte. Not only is the Caliph a religious strongman, but his hold over the Middle East is tenuous but still undeniable. While the Dominion may be gearing up for another round of warfare, an alliance with Istanbul would strangle that hope in its cradle and make Afghanistan as peaceful as the Middle East!"
AFG_army_chief:0 "All for the Commander-in-Chief!"
AFG_army_chief_desc:0 "Most of the Army had long rallied behind their old Commander in Chief, however, the reformist officers and soldiers remained hesitant. However, with Nasrullah’s reign completely unchallenged and their leaders cowed or in hiding, more and more of them are switching sides. Now the Army stands totally united under their first Commander in Chief and devoted to the safety and preservation of Afghan sovereignty."
AFG_negotiate_with_the_wild_card:0 "Make the Wild Card Fold"
AFG_negotiate_with_the_wild_card_desc:0 "Nadir Shah is an outlier in the candidates for the throne. Having only lived in Afghanistan for a few decades, he spent most of his life in exile in India. That has made his true loyalties suspect. Until now he has made no real effort to take the throne but Nasrullah knows of his true ambitions, and the fact he plans on eventually acting on them. Nasrullah will bring Nadir to the table and get him to give up his claim and if he doesn't, who will miss one vanished exile?"
AFG_renounce_durand:0 "Thin out the Expedition"
AFG_renounce_durand_desc:0 "The German Expedition has remained in Afghanistan for too long. While the Kaiser’s help has been invaluable, his soldiers have begun to gather a clique of seditionists and fifth columnists around them seeking to draw Afghanistan closer to Berlin. This simply cannot continue. While it would be simple to expel them all, doing that would anger the Kaiser and alienate a good friend in times of crisis. Instead, Nasrullah will send a letter to the Kaiser and ask him politely to drawback most of the Expedition. The skeleton crew that remains will be useful to us while also being so hobbled as to not be a threat to Nasrullah’s rule."
AFG_the_soldier_emir:0 "The Soldier Emir"
AFG_the_soldier_emir_desc:0 "The Emir has and always will be closely tied to the military. He once ran it as its Commander in Chief, he led it in the battle against the decadent Raj while his elder brother drowned in decadence and now he leads it once more not as simply Commander in Chief, but Emir. His military victories and consolidation of the Army behind him have gained him the moniker, ‘the Soldier Emir’. While Nasrullah would have wanted a more pious decoration, even he is unable to say it's too far from the truth."
AFG_the_second_iron_emir:0 "The Second Iron Emir"
AFG_the_second_iron_emir_desc:0 "Nasrullah’s father Abdur Rahman Khan was called the Iron Emir for his harsh totalitarian rule. Under him there was no dissent, just determined citizens working to further Afghanistan. If Nasrullah is to achieve a lasting peace within his country then he must emulate his father in some respects."
AFG_aurangzeb:0 "Emulate Aurangzeb"
AFG_aurangzeb_desc:0 "The ancient Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb is known in the West as a religious tyrant and despot whose policies are looked upon...unfavorably. They are simply wrong, Aurangzeb was a pious man who wanted to bring his subjects eternal paradise by bringing them closer to Allah. Nasrullah knows this more than anybody and will seek to emulate him whenever possible. The spiritual health of the people is critical for the spiritual health of the nation."
AFG_aurangzeb_ornament:0 "Ornament of the Throne"
AFG_aurangzeb_ornament_desc:0 "Aurangzeb gained the nickname Ornament of the Throne for his successful economic policies that made India the largest economy on earth at the time, even surpassing Qing China. He even kickstarted a proto-Industrialization of Bengal. Nasrullah will emulate his success in Afghanistan. The economy is currently in tatters but Afghanistan is home to numerous valuable resources. By harnessing these resources and the various cottage industries across the nation the coffers will be restored and Afghanistan will not only know peace but prosperity."
AFG_aurangzeb_conquerer:0 "Conquerer of the World"
AFG_aurangzeb_conquerer_desc:0 "Aurangzeb is noted for his conquests of southern India. While in abstract comparison Nasrullah’s conquests are small, Afghanistan had still nearly doubled in size and had gained hundreds of thousands of new citizens. Nasrullah has done the impossible and broken the Durand Line and humbled India itself! With enough manpower behind him, there would be nothing that can stop him from whatever he may desire!"
AFG_realize_mughal_ambitions:0 "Realize Mughal Ambitions"
AFG_realize_mughal_ambitions_desc:0 "The lands taken in India are still crawling with dissenters and rebels, even if they don’t make themselves public. Imperialists of the British and Indian flavors, Indian nationalists, and general dissenters of the Emir’s rule have made the area their home. Nasrullah has finally decided to do something about this and has ordered the Darogha to sweep the New Territories for potential trouble areas with orders to ‘deal with all problems promptly’. Reports of executions in the streets are already pouring in and are only expected to get more frequent."
AFG_fatawa:0 "The Fatawa 'Alamgiri"
AFG_fatawa_desc:0 "The Fatawa Alamgiri is a set of Sharia Law put in place by Aurangzeb throughout his Empire. Nasrullah has put forward a proposal to adopt a modified version of this for Afghanistan. This has caused some debate among his advisors. Those loyal to Nasrullah point out how it led the Mughal Empire under Aurangzeb to new heights economically and militarily while also keeping resistance to the Mughals repressed. They also point out that the Raj still uses a version of this as their own law. The proposal's enemies condemn it as too restrictive, too open to interpretation, and therefore unable to be properly enforced. However, it’s up to Nasrullah to decide."
AFG_sharia_administration:0 "Reimpose Sharia?"
AFG_sharia_administration_desc:0 "A proposal has come from Nasrullah to impose Sharia Law across all of Afghanistan. This has been met with both celebration from the Conservative elements of society and clerics while simultaneously enraging more liberal elements, particularly among these are the Hindus, an outspoken minority who has opposed Nasrullah since he took the throne. If we go through with this they will surely fight back. Ultimately, it’s up for Nasrullah to decide."
AFG_return_of_jizya:0 "The Gold must Flow!"
AFG_return_of_jizya_desc:0 "For any state to function it must collect its taxes. The ruggedness of Afghanistan has made this an issue for every one of its rulers. Nasrullah is determined to overcome this hurdle. A new system of tax collection will be instituted to ensure all of Afghanistan’s subjects pay their due to the Crown so the state may be properly maintained. This will cause considerable grumbling, especially among the tribes who were able to slip away from taxes for so long, but that is the price we must pay."
AFG_polish_the_jewel:0 "Polish the Jewel"
AFG_polish_the_jewel_desc:0 "To help integrate the new territories we will begin to set up a Development Fund for these new areas. By direct investments, we will slowly intertwine these new areas into their new homeland and buy the goodwill of the locals. It will take a while and the locals will likely hinder our every effort, but it’s an effort that must be expended if all of Afghanistan is to be one."
AFG_patronize_works:0 "Facilitate Spread of Islamic Culture"
AFG_patronize_works_desc:0 "Afghanistan is a mix of Indian, Central Asian, Islamic, and even remnant Greek culture. This cultural disunity cannot stand if Afghanistan is to continue to function. Nasrullah will set up a Department of Islamic Culture to promote and encourage Islamic culture in the areas it is weakest. New Islamic newspapers will be printed, Islamic will replace local languages, and monuments to non-Islamic heroes will be replaced or overshadowed by new ones. This is a heavy step to take, to suppress dissenting cultures in favor of our own, but the hardest choices take the strongest wills."
AFG_temperance_in_rule:0 "A Rule of Piety and Temperance"
AFG_temperance_in_rule_desc:0 "Aurangzeb was a deeply pious man, much like Nasrullah, and he cut down on the pomp and circumstance of the Mughal Court to donate more to charity and local mosques. Nasrullah, emulating this great man, will do the same. The decadence of his predecessor will be curtailed and the money saved will be donated to the newly established Afghan Prosperity Fund and to mosques. Some will accuse Nasrullah of donating to Mosques to reward his cleric allies. Nasrullah has no comment on such baseless accusations."
