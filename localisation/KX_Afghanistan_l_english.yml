afghanredux.0.t:0 "The Graveyard of Empires Stirs"
afghanredux.0.d:0 "Much has changed for the Emirate of Afghanistan since the turn of the century. Habibullāh Khan’s reign initially endeavored to push his once reformative agenda into practice despite resistance from the nation’s many entrenched conservative sources of influence. Despite this, Afghanistan has seen some progress, with its legal, economic and educational systems all receiving minorly beneficial reforms, but above all, no institution within our Emirate has flourished like our military has, with Habibullāh passing a slew of new laws to improve the Afghan Army. This military prowess was built up as the earliest years of the new century dragged on until the Weltkrieg broke out in 1914. \n\nAs the horrific Weltkrieg dragged on, Afghanistan was put under increasing pressure from both the Kaiserreich and the Ottoman Empire to join the conflict on their behalf. Initially, Habibullāh resisted these calls for war, instead turning inward as he focused on ruling his own kingdom sealed away from the wider world. However, this peace would be shattered in 1917, when a band of tribes rallied by Nasrullah Khan and Ghāzī Amānullāh Khān disobeyed all previous orders and took a secretive gamble to push into British India without informing their Emir. Without support from the wider armed forces, Amānullāh’s forces were disastrously beaten and quickly forced back into Afghani territory, dragging the nation into the Weltkrieg and sparking a third war between us and the Anglos ... \n\nTwo years prior, the Kaiserreich established the Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition, a military attache aimed at training, supplying, and otherwise aiding the Afghani forces for a surprise attack against the Ango-Indian forces. Eventually, the cacophony of the Weltkrieg drew silent, and Afghanistan stood on the side of the victors.\n\nAs the decades since that horrific conflict have worn on, Habibullāh’s rule has only drifted further from his original ideals as he grows lazier and more opulent with age. It is now 1936, and the German mission is still here, Habibullāh still lounges on his throne, and our Emirate is as unstable as ever. The constant meddling of the Kaiser’s expeditionary force has only driven up unrest, regardless of the military benefits it has provided, and this chaotic situation has only been stoked by the rising radicalism being proliferated within the Provisional Government of India which we have so generously harbored. The Young Afghans, a local nationalist movement, grow increasingly vocal over their displeasure with Habibullāh’s rule, and the Emir’s two main rivals of Amānullāh and Nasrullah are at each other’s throats, each vying for their seat on Habibullāh’s throne. The aging Emir is growing desperate to keep his seat of power intact, and some whisper that he is even willing to start another war to do it. The nation of Afghanistan is once again on the edge of great change or utter collapse, and only Allah knows which way it will fall."

afghanredux.1.d.victory:0 "After our brilliant victory against the vile and treacherous British and their pawns of the Delhi Dominion, thus proving once again Afghanistan's nickname of Graveyards of Empire, the power and popularity of our great king has never been higher. The previously disunited tribes now find unity in the pride of the newfound Afghan power and the many plots against our sovereign seem to have dissipated. It was decided to organize a great and sumptuous parade in the streets of Kabul, with a huge crowd and all the tribal and political representatives of the country present during the event. At the end of the parade, King Ghazi Habibullah Khan delivered a speech to his people praising the merits of Afghanistan's modernization and its proud army during the Fifth Anglo-Afghan War. To the surprise of his people, the King announced the formation of a new Barakzai Empire, risen from the ashes of the Durrani and Mughals, and that he would lead it to greatness. He left the stage to the loud applause of both his people and the tribal leaders.\n\nMeanwhile in Delhi, news of the announcement of 'Mughal ambitions' has shaken the government to its core. Communications between Delhi and Ottowa are frantic. Fear of another invasion, one which could see the complete annexation of the Raj, has paralyzed the British administration. The Entente's grip over India seems to be at its lowest point yet."
afghanredux.1.d.defeat:0 "After our humiliating defeat against the British forces in the Fifth Anglo-Afghan War, the position of King Habibullah had never been so precarious and fragile, the numerous conspiracies against him by the tribal lords and even some members of the government intensified greatly. The tribal instability in our country has also greatly increased as Afghan national pride has been torn to shreds and a strong resentment against the King is felt among the population. Undoubtedly because of these factors, having failed to modernize Afghanistan and lead it to glory, and fearing for his life, our King fled the country in the early hours of the morning with some of his relatives and much of the treasury. This flight did not help the stability of the country, which is on the verge of chaos as conflicts spark between various political factions each wanting more control. The future of Afghanistan is grim."

afghanredux.2.d:0 "As the Anglo-Afghan War rages on, Kabul has come to us requesting planes and a contingent of elite troops to aid them in defeating the British Indians in Delhi. The war is hotly contested right now, with both sides having a fair chance at victory. Our support could help tip the balance in favor of the Afghans, especially in the battle for the air. Since Afghanistan and the German Empire are on friendly terms, helping the Afghans out would reaffirm our ties and further improve relations. In addition, such a move would surely come as a snub to the Canadians, something that is always welcome by the German people. However, with Black Monday currently ravaging our economy and the Empire having bigger problems to deal with than Afghanistan's distant wars, perhaps it might be best to keep the planes and men to ourselves. Some have pointed out that while it would be nice to have a strong friend in the region, supporting the Afghans comes with the risk of upsetting the Canadians at a time when their new King provides an opportunity for renewed relations, and would undoubtedly hurt us in the long run should Delhi emerge victorious. We must choose carefully..."
afghanredux.2.a:0 "We shall support our friends in Kabul, send the planes and boys over!"
afghanredux.2.b:0 "We sympathize with Afghanistan's struggle, but we simply cannot aid them at this time."

However, the instability brought by German influence and lobbying and the Indian Provisional Government's radicalism has begun to reach a crisis point. With every day that passes, support for the Young Afghans and a war to destroy the British Raj grows. With every day that passes, whispers of treason against the Emir become more and more common. They say that the Emir has grown fat, lazy, complacent. They say that he is no longer even Muslim, that he plans to subvert Islam and destroy Afghan traditions. They say he is nothing more than a German puppet.\n\nEven if our army is in shambles, we have no choice. We must go to war against the British Raj, lest the house of cards comes crashing down."
