GAL_karol_olbracht_desc:0 "Karol Olbracht tbd"
GAL_golicja_glodomeria:0 "Golicja i Głodomeria"
GAL_golicja_glodomeria_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, also known simply as Galicia or Austrian Poland, was established in 1772 as a crownland of the Habsburg Monarchy as a result of the First Partition of Poland.  After initially strong Germanization, in 1861 Galicia gained autonomy with the national parliament and the government in the capital city of Lviv. In 1867, with the establishment of a dualistic monarchy, the provincial autonomy was extended. The Austrian government guaranteed that governors would be appointed from among local Poles. The local parliament 'Sejm Krajowy' had the right to pass laws on the national economy, communication, education and health. The Austrian authorities have not invested in the region for decades, which is why  Galicia was one of the poorest regions in Europe. Poles from other regions used to even maliciously refer to Galicia and Lodommeria as 'Golicja i Glodomeria', which would mean 'Nakedia and Hungeria'."
GAL_rural_society:0 "Rural Society"
GAL_rural_society_desc:0 "The Galician society consisted mainly of peasants and smallholders. Although the majority of the inhabitants lived in the villages, the fragmentation of land meant that agriculture was not very profitable."
GAL_minority_unrest:0 "Restless Minorities"
GAL_minority_unrest_desc:0 "Galicia was also divided ethnically and religiously. The largest group of 46 percent. were Roman Catholics (mainly Poles, but there was also a small community of German settlers). A slightly smaller group were Greek Catholics (42 percent). Most of them described themselves as Ukrainians or Ruthenians (sometimes contrasting both terms), but some of the inhabitants referred to themselves as 'tutejsi' or locals. The Jewish population also constituted a significant proportion (over 10 percent). From 1867, almost all power was in Polish hands, which only intensified the tensions. "
GAL_shattered_unity:0 "Shattered Political Unity"
GAL_shattered_unity_desc:0 "Thanks to its extensive autonomy, Galicia became the center of the Polish independence movement. Polish political parties and paramilitary organizations operated here, which were the basis of the Legions formed at the beginning of the 20th century. The armed organizations established during the war, however, did not win the independence or the unification of Galician lands with lands from other partitions. At present, confidence in Vienna is shaky, even though almost all legal political parties declare (most often apparently) their support for the monarchy."
GAL_golicja_glodomeria_2:0 "Golicja i Głodomeria"
GAL_golicja_glodomeria_desc:0 "tbd - very poor region, lack of funds from Vienna, Nakedia & Hungeria"

GAL_land_reform:0 "Land Reform"
GAL_land_reform_desc:0 "Galicia was the country with the highest percentage of people working in agriculture. At the same time, agriculture in Galicia was one of the least profitable in Europe. The reason for this was the simultaneous existence of thousands of farms so small that they could not feed themselves, and of enormous aristocratic estates. The land reform assumed the reduction of the latter and the distribution of confiscated land to smallholders."
GAL_credit_unions:0 "Credit Unions"
GAL_credit_unions_desc:0 "Frequently in foreign hands, banks cannot be trusted. The Polish peasant should benefit from credit institutions created especially for his needs.

GAL_industrial_crops_initiative:0 "Industrial Crops Initiative"

GAL_church_state_relations:0 "Church & State Relations"
GAL_church_state_relations_desc:0 "The Polish peasant is religious. And very well. However, it is important to be clear.

Will the opinion of the clergy always be binding on the citizens of our country or will it be binding only in matters of faith? "
GAL_minority_outreach:0 "Minority Outreach"
GAL_minority_outreach_desc:0 "The Polish peasant has no evil intentions towards anyone. Peasants of other nationalities are equally exploited by the powerful of this world. The Polish peasant is also the host of this land. We must therefore clarify the relationship with minorities, even with those who were not always loyal to the Polish peasantry."
GAL_unicameralism:0 "Unicameralism"
GAL_unicameralism_desc:0 "A bicameral parliament is a form of class exploitation practiced by the aristocracy. The introduction of a unicameral parliament in which representatives of the peasants and nobility would sit on equal terms would make Galicia a fully democratic state."
GAL_administrative_reform:0 "Administrative Reform"
GAL_administrative_reform_desc:0 "The current administrative division is outdated and does not meet the needs of the Galician society. Administrative boundaries go back to the divisions of the eighteenth century and do not take into account other ethnic and economic conditions. People's activists such as Józef Buzek, Kazimierz Bartel or Bolesław Wysłouch presented a number of solutions to this problem. "
GAL_peoples_education:0 "People's Education"
GAL_peoples_education_desc:0 "One of the main problems plaguing the people of Galicia is illiteracy.

GAL_chlopomania:0 "Chłopomania"
GAL_chlopomania_desc:0 "The intelligentsia fascination with the peasantry was a common phenomenon at the beginning of the 20th century in Galicia.

GAL_peasants_guard:0 "Peasants' Guard"
GAL_peasants_guard_desc:0 "The army has so far been exclusively aristocratic. Time to break with it. The agrarian movement will seek to create an armed force composed of the Peasants. For this reason, it will be necessary to create new armed formations, such as Peasants' Guard, alongside the reformed army. In the future, these new formed formations will become the future army of peasant Galicia. "

GAL_kordon_sokalski:0 "Kordon Sokalski"
GAL_kordon_sokalski_desc:0 "Not all national minorities were equally willing to cooperate and integrate. The Ukrainians from Eastern Lesser Poland turned out to be particularly unruly. In order to prevent contacts with their compatriots from Volhynia and the rest of Ukraine, a colonization campaign should be carried out on an ethnically mixed border. It is therefore necessary to place Polish peasant-colonists in order to separate a large groups of Ukrainians from each other."
GAL_ukrainian_cooperation:0 "Ukrainian Cooperation"
GAL_ukrainian_cooperation_desc:0 "The Ukrainians living in Galicia are valuable allies and cooperation with them brings mutual benefits.

GAL_searching_coalition_partners_desc:0 "Enjoying the sympathy of the peasantry, the ChSR was lonely in parliament. So there were voices that we should seek support from other political parties in order to be able to carry out the desired reforms. "
GAL_parcellation_land:0 "Parcellation of Land"
GAL_parcellation_land_desc:0 "It is not fair that a hard-working peasant should have such a small farm that he cannot feed himself.

Therefore, it is necessary to introduce limits on the owned arable land and distribute the surplus to those in need."
GAL_strike_usury:0 "Strike at Usury"
GAL_strike_usury_desc:0 "Bankers and greedy exploiters preyed on the naivety of the Polish peasantry. Interest of hundreds of percent ruined entire families. This must be stopped. We must cancel the unfairly charged percentage and ban this harmful practice. "

GAL_rural_industrial_cooperatives:0 "Rural-Industrial Cooperatives"

GAL_folk_morality_desc:0 "The presumption that poor and simple people are guided by moral principles is not fully supported by the truth.

GAL_support_zionism:0 "Support Zionism"

GAL_intellectual_ethos:0 "Intellectual Ethos"
GAL_intellectual_ethos_desc:0 "For conservatives, the electoral law was favorable. The quality of votes was more important than their number.

gal.1.t:0 "Galicia and Lodomeria Becomes Independent"
gal.1.d:0 "After centuries under Habsburg rule that began with the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia Lodomeria sees herself independent. But we are a weak state surrounded by impressive neighbours - and maybe we would do good seeking protection from Poland, the nation our territory has been taken from all these years ago."
gal.1.a:0 "Ask to formally join Poland. (Game Over)"
gal.1.b:0 "Galicia shall remain independent."

gal.2.t:0 "Galicia Seeks to Join Our Nation"
gal.2.d:0 "After centuries under Habsburg rule that began with the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia Lodomeria sees herself independent. But being a weak state surrounded by impressive neighbours, the newly independent nation feels her very existence threatened. A diplomatic envoy arrived today to discuss an incorporation of Galicia into Polish territory."
gal.2.a:0 "Welcome home, brothers."

gal.3.t:0 "Claiming the Bucovina"
gal.3.d:0 "Being independent for only a handful of days, the Galician nation, formerly a vassal state to the Crown of Austria, has been incorporated into the Polish state. However, amongst the ethnically diverse population of Galicia, its southernmost province, the Bucovina, is home to many Romanians. Given the current confusion within the territory, we could relatively easily seize it in a swift manoeuvre."
gal.3.a:0 "Let us free our brothers."
gal.3.b:0 "Provoking the Poles is not wise."

gal.4.t:0 "Claiming East Galicia"
gal.4.d:0 "Being independent for only a handful of days, the Galician nation, formerly a vassal state to the Crown of Austria, has been incorporated into the Polish state. However, amongst the ethnically diverse population of Galicia, the East is home to mostly Ukrainians. Given the current confusion within the territory, we could relatively easily seize it in a swift manoeuvre."
gal.4.a:0 "Let us free our brothers."
gal.4.b:0 "Provoking the Poles is not wise."

gal.5.t:0 "Romania Has Marched into the Bucovina"
gal.5.d:0 "An incorporation of a territory as large as Galicia was never expected to go smoothly. However what wasn't expected was meddling from the outside - Romanian troops have marched into the largely Romanian-speaking territory Bucovina, claiming the state as their own. Officials of the former Galician government have urged us to intervene."
gal.5.a:0 "This shall not stand. Retake what is ours!"
gal.5.b:0 "Let the Romanians have what speaks Romanian."

gal.6.t:0 "The Ukraine has Seized Eastern Galicia"
gal.6.d:0 "Kraków and Lwów are the most important cities of Galicia. The integration of the former has gone smoothly over the run of the last week, however the inhabitants of the mostly Ruthenian-speaking territories surrounding Lwow have, with aid of the Ukrainian military, seized the city. The city of Lwów is too important for Poland to just let it fall into the hands of another country."
gal.6.a:0 "This shall not stand. Retake what is ours!"
gal.6.b:0 "Ruthenians aren't Poles anyway."

gal.7.t:0 "Karl Albrecht Elected as King of Poland"
gal.7.d:0 "The current Governor of Galicia and Lodomeria, Karl Albrecht von Habsburg, has just been elected as the new King of Poland after an intensely contested vote. Karl Albrecht is expected to leave the nation early tomorrow to take up his new position as leader of the Polish people, and has left Jozef Haller von Hallenburg in charge of Galicia in his absence."
gal.7.a:0 "Wish him luck."

gal.10.t:0 "Galicia in 1936"
gal.10.d:0 "Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and the Grand Duchy of Kraków with the Duchies of Auschwitz and Zator"
gal.10.a:0 "We shall endure."

gal.11.t:0 "Dark Clouds Over the Duchy"
gal.11.d:0 "very bad times."
gal.11.a:0 "It can't possibly be worse."

gal.12.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Galicia!"
gal.12.d:0 "very bad times."
gal.12.a:0 "We are doomed!"

gal.13.t:0 "A Temporary Agreement"
gal.13.d:0 "no agreement in politics"
gal.13.a:0 "Curses!"

gal.14.t:0 "Imperial Demands"
gal.14.d:0 "Get funds but accept Krakow Economic School and free market."
gal.14.a:0 "We have no other choice."
