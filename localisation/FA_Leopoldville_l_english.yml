### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_HUYGHE_DESC:0 "Chevalier Armand Huyghé de Mahenge has long served the Force Publique as one of its more respected generals. Born in 1871, Huyghé studied at the Royal Military Academy as soon as he was of age and joined the Flandro-Wallonian Army soon after in 1891, quickly transferring to the Force Publique in 1893 and making his way for the Congo. Serving initially under the Leopold regime, Huyghé learned hard and fast how to survive in these harsh jungles, teaching him the skills he would need to eventually become one of the FP’s most important figures. After serving heroically in the Weltkrieg both at Yser and in East Africa, Huyghé further made a name for himself as a tried and true career soldier. Following the war, the aging veteran Huyghé decided to take a step back from front-line command and has gotten himself a less-stressful position as head of the local Force Publique detachment that guards the Congolese metropolis of Leopoldville. With this relaxed position under his belt, Huyghé has worked diligently to maintain an unseen atmosphere of peace and stability within the city and its surrounding rural expanse - a talent that has proven far more relevant now that the Congo finds itself thrown into chaos. Under Armand Huyghé, Leopoldville is safe, but should this aging general slip up, who knows what shall happen to this Gem of the Congo he is sworn to protect."
POLITICS_KIMBANGU_DESC:0 "Whether you believe he was delivered to the top of Mount Zion as an infant or simply born and left orphaned in a cruel but necessary twist of fate, none can deny the mystery and awe-inspiring glory that surrounds Simon Kimbangu, or ‘the one who reveals the hidden meaning of all things.’ Born sometime in 1889, though his followers preach absolutely that he was born on September 12th, 1887, Kimbangu was an orphan taken in by Baptist missionaries, setting his life from the beginning to a track devout service to the Lord. As he grew older, he began work as a catechist around his home of Nkamba, preaching through the lands of the Bakongo, and becoming famous for his reputed ability to perform miracles. Purportedly able to heal the sick and cure the blind, Kimbangu possessed many claimed mystical powers such as astral projection, premonition, and levitation. Largest of his claims, or more accurately the claims of his sons and followers, is that Kimbangu is not only a servant of divinity, but he is divinity itself, for he is the Holy Spirit itself made manifest. As the Ngunza, or prophet, Kimbangu is the herald of the true African Jesus Christ and the new savior of the Congo. However, as these powers and claims gained him more favor with his fellow Congolese, it conversely drew the ire of the old colonial order. Though preaching an innately apolitical creed, the Force Publique took great offense to Kimbangu’s preachings, and had him imprisoned in 1921 after a series of riots and protests broke out in and around Leopoldville that were started by Kimbangu loyalists. Though he kept in contact with his people, Kimbangu languished in prison for almost two decades until he was freed during the early chaos of the Congo Civil War. \n\nNow, with his shackles broken and his lungs filled with the free air once again, the Ngunza Kimbangu preaches the good word of the Lord as he crusades to peacefully end sin and conflict across Congo and the wider African world. As the physical embodiment of the Holy Spirit, he shall bring divinity and salvation to this new Eden."

### Ideas ###
LPD_mouth_of_the_congo_idea:0 "Control of Port Matadi"
LPD_mouth_of_the_congo_idea_desc:0 "We control what may be the most important piece of infrastructure in all of Congo - the Port of Matadi. Connected to our fair metropolis with the Matadi-Leopoldville Railway, this harbor serves as the chief seaport for the entire Vrijstaat, or did before this violent collapse. We must defend the port at all costs, for without it, both Leopoldville and the entire Congo shall be sealed off from the wider world."

LPD_martial_law_idea:0 "Rule of the Force Publique"
LPD_martial_law_idea_desc:0 "Though the civilian government is still nominally within control, the city of Leopoldville and its surrounding districts and zones of control exists under a strict regime and atmosphere of martial law led by the leading officers of the Force Publique left in the city. These soldiers and militias enforce a sense of order and calm within this African metropolis, creating a placid oasis of relative peace here in this chaotic Congo at the expense of civil liberty. The Force Publique must not take their rule too far or act too harshly, lest the locals throw of the looming spectre of the FP once and for all."

LPD_defend_the_city:0 "The Gem of the Vrijstaat"
LPD_defend_the_city_desc:0 "Whether you call it Leopoldville or Kinshasa, the varied people of this African metropolis have a great love for their city. As one of the largest cities on this continent, we rule over a vast amount of people but also have a massive amount of resources at our disposal. We must defend this gem of the Congo, no matter the cost, even as whispers of old foes surface among this chaos."

LPD_declare_independence:0 "The Declaration of Independence"
LPD_declare_independence_desc:0 "We have been cast adrift onto this sea of chaos that has replaced and consumed the once pristine and placid region of Congo. To consolidate our rule as we find our metropolis tossed into the role of a provisional government, we must issue a formal declaration of independence from the Congo colony. Under the leadership of General Armand Huyghé and the Force Publique, a new sovereign city-state shall rise here on Congo’s lone corridor to the sea. Whether you are a settler of Leopoldville or a Kinois of Kinshasa, we must band together as Congo falls to crisis!"

LPD_fate_of_the_north:0 "Fate of the Congo"
LPD_fate_of_the_north_desc:0 "To the East of our cosmopolitan haven, the rest of the Congo is embroiled in fierce war as mercenaries and natives rise against the colonialist machine. We must decide here and now what our policy towards these collapse-states shall be. Whether we soldier on to defend the colonial dream or decide to abandon our imperialism-born identity, we shall ever preserve this oasis of tranquility we have crafted."

LPD_unify_congo:0 "Congolese Unification"
LPD_unify_congo_desc:0 "The vast colonial apparatus that once ruled over this region we call Congo had long squandered their opportunity at creating a stable and cohesive nation. It falls onto us to crusade across the former lands of the Vrijstaat to create a truly pluralistic federation that can withstand the chaotic rigors of nation-building in Africa."

LPD_the_force_publique:0 "Free Reign of the Force Publique"
LPD_the_force_publique_desc:0 "The Force Publique has long served as the final line of defense between Congo and absolute chaos. Their oppressive but effective tactics are infamous throughout the colony, and despite their aging equipment and dwindling White officer corp, the natives in their employ make up for it with their savagery and tenacity. We must write a blank cheque to allow this last sword and shield of our safety free reign to do as they deem necessary to preserve our stability and safety."

LPD_support_the_government:0 "Recognize the Free State"
LPD_support_the_government_desc:0 "The Vrijstaat, or Free State, is the rightful Congolese government, and as such, our natural allies. Long has the city of Leopoldville served the Ryckmans Regime, and this cooperation shall continue. Our metropolis is the largest and most influential in all of Congo and serves as the colony’s only access to the sea; they simply can not survive without us, and we both know it."

LPD_rejoin_the_freestate:0 "The Question of Unification"
LPD_rejoin_the_freestate_desc:0 "Though our territorial extent is small, we are the bigger player in these coming negotiations. As the most important city and only seaport in all of Congo, the Ryckmans Regime will simply not survive without resources and opportunities that float into our harbor. We will approach them about unification, but if they choose to accept, we will hold their nation and all future ambitions of Congo by the balls."

LPD_team_switzerland:0 "Pledge Neutrality"
LPD_team_switzerland_desc:0 "To pick a side in this Congolese civil war would tear our nation apart. We must profess strict neutrality in this conflict as we work to secure our citizens from this maelstrom. We have far more important things to focus on instead of shooting our own countrymen in the mud."

LPD_be_nice_to_the_natives:0 "Metropolitan Cosmopolitanism"
LPD_be_nice_to_the_natives_desc:0 "Our fair city is massive, stretching across both sprawling urban and rural zones, holding thousands of souls and dozens of ethnic groups and minorities. We must account and care for each and every one of these groups, without favoritism, lest our entire city-state collapse into the same chaos that has befallen our fellow Congolese. All shall be welcome in our city limits as long as they abide by our rules."

LPD_defend_the_port:0 "The Mouth of the Congo"
LPD_defend_the_port_desc:0 "We control what may be the most important piece of infrastructure in all of Congo - the Port of Matadi. Connected to our fair metropolis with the Matadi-Leopoldville Railway, this harbor serves as the chief seaport for the entire Vrijstaat, or did before this violent collapse. We must defend the port at all costs, for without it, both Leopoldville and the entire Congo shall be sealed off from the wider world."

LPD_fortify_the_city:0 "From a City to a Fortress"
LPD_fortify_the_city_desc:0 "Our first and last stand against any enemy will likely take place at the gates of this city we call home, and as such, we must not allow it to fall. Leopoldville shall be transformed into an imposing and unassailable bastion. Walls shall be raised, bunkers and pillboxes constructed, and barbed wire and mines placed across our perimeter. Any foe wishing to take this city will have to crash through these defenses and cut us down to the last man."

LPD_new_status_quo:0 "The New Status Quo"
LPD_new_status_quo_desc:0 "We have established our rule over all of the former lands of the Vrijstaat, and now we stand as the new masters of the wild lands of Congo. The Force Publique is still nominally in charge, and has now declared an intention to slowly return to civilian rule. Embracing the ideas that saved our city and forged our new sense of unity, we shall spread these pluralistic principles to all people of the Congo as we struggle to repair the schism that caused the crisis we have endeavored through."

LPD_strike_a_balance:0 "Strike a Balance"
LPD_strike_a_balance_desc:0 "We must take a measured hand to our rule over this new Congolese state, for we are in untested waters. The refined Force Publique shall serve as the shepherds of this new nation, slowly building up the necessary bureaucracy and administrations needed to transition to a more permanent state. By balancing a need for stability with a desire for freedom and pluralism, the FP will attempt to lay the foundations of our new state."

LPD_promise_not_to_do_leopold_things:0 "Never Another Leopold"
LPD_promise_not_to_do_leopold_things_desc:0 "The horrors of the reign of King Leopold are still fresh in the minds of all Congolese, especially the natives, forever scaring the image of colonial rule and sullying the word of Europeans in the minds of many natives. We must make clear to our new populace that the madness of the Leopold regime will never be allowed to return to these lands, and that the remaining colonists and settlers are here to contribute to this new society as equally as their African countrymen."

LPD_democracy_in_quotation_marks:0 "A Budding ‘Democracy’"
LPD_democracy_in_quotation_marks_desc:0 "To make good on our promises, the Force Publique and General Armand Huyghé have decided to make way for ‘fair and free’ elections. Though only accepted, non-radical parties have been allowed to run and some rumors of tampering have circulated around, the FP assures us that this is truly the arrival of bonafide democracy here in Congo."

LPD_local_autonomy:0 "Tribal Autonomies"
LPD_local_autonomy_desc:0 "Within our borders exist many native kingdoms, chiefdoms, and barely-contacted tribes. In order to quell any potential unrest from these masses, we shall grant them large amounts of autonomy, giving them free reign to rule their own people as they please. They will still be forced to pay some sort of tithe to our government like any of our citizens, but given their positions, monetary compensation is not always feasible or even the best option. Any groups that do not wish to or can not pay can instead offer their produced goods, manpower, or anything else, and in return, they can largely do as they please."

LPD_congolese_federalism:0 "Congolese Federalism"
LPD_congolese_federalism_desc:0 "A true Congolese Federation once seemed like a fantasy, but now this idea can become a reality. Embracing our roots as cosmopolitan people in a massively diverse region, we shall attempt an experiment unlike any seen in Africa so far - a true democratic federation. Constituent ‘states’ shall range from autonomous kingdoms to newly created administrative provinces. Emulating larger nations such as the United States and the Kaiserreich, we will create a true, united federation of Congolese states."

##Kimbagu Tree

LPD_Kimbanguist_Takeover:0 "The Salvation of the Congo"
LPD_Kimbanguist_Takeover_desc:0 "With the Force Publique and the officials of Leopoldville failing to properly deal with Commander Janssens’ cruelty, their persecution of Ngunzism, and the growing calls for colonialism being ignored and suppressed, the situation in Congo’s gleaming city has reached critical mass. In the wake of this chaos, the prophet Simon Kimbangu has risen to bring salvation to this war-torn paradise. Under his divine light as the manifestation of the Holy Spirit and the herald of Jesus Christ, the Congo shall be cleansed of suffering and sin."

LPD_africanize_faith:0 "Africanize our Faith"
LPD_africanize_faith_desc:0 "With the actions of the colonial Protestant and Catholic churches so fresh in the memory of our people, with their fear of our one true faith causing the backlash that got our Ngunza imprisoned for so long. These false faiths must be abandoned, and a new, uniquely African strain of Christian dogma shall be fostered as the foundation of Ngunzism, or Kimbanguism as it is becoming known. Local beliefs from the Balikongo, Bantu, and Swahili-speaking groups shall be incorporated into our doctrine as we drift away from the Bible and the Nicene Creed, separating us from the heretics."

LPD_stick_to_christianity:0 "Respect the Nicene Creed"
LPD_stick_to_christianity_desc:0 "Though the actions of the faithful colonials were heinous and reprehensible, their ideas on Christianity and faith were not. By staying true to our roots in Baptism, resolving our Puritan ideals, and continuing to respect the ancient Nicene Creed of the First Ecumenical Council of Rome, we shall foster true piety in the Congo while staying true to tradition and fostering closer ties with the remaining colonials and those both withing our nation and abroad who may not be so keen on full-blown Africanization of Christianity."

LPD_ban_old_churches:0 "Ban the Heretics and Heathens"
LPD_ban_old_churches_desc:0 "The numerous heretics and heathens that have infested the Congo have had their way for far too long. Under their watch, our paradise has fallen into sin and chaos as hell itself has been unleashed across these jungles through war, greed, and calamity. They have had enough chances to rescind their wicked ways and adhere to the true, peaceful gospel of the Lord, and shall be treated as the sinners they are. Their faiths shall be declared heretical, and themselves offered a choice - be excommunicated and shunned from our society, or embrace the One True Faith of Ngunzism."

LPD_keep_old_churches_around:0 "Let the Old Churches Operate"
LPD_keep_old_churches_around_desc:0 "Though their interpretation of the scriptures can often be hollow or faulty, and their beliefs may often be too Eurocentric, the lesser faiths that are the different Protestant sects, Catholicism, and even the few Muslim and Jewish souls with the Congo shall be allowed to operate and continue their faith in the one Lord. We are all students of Abraham and children of God, even though clearly we are the most favored of His sons."

LPD_new_script:0 "Embrace the Mandombe Script"
LPD_new_script_desc:0 "Coming to Kimbangu in a premonition or a dream, the Mandombe script is a new alphabet and system of writing based around ‘S’ and ‘5’ shaped symbols intended to replace the varied and diverse writing systems of the Congo. One unified script for both religious and secular text across the nation shall foster a greater sense of unity and camaraderie within our great and varied Eden. Though the growing pains of teaching a new language to the entire nation shall be great, it is an undertaking we must make to foster true unity."

LPD_no_new_script:0 "Foster Linguistic Diversity"
LPD_no_new_script_desc:0 "The Congo is a massive place, full of different cultures, peoples, and languages. The major languages of Kikongo, Swahili, Tshiluba, and Lingala, as well as the dozens of other Bantu languages that dot this expanse, each form a unique part of the beautiful and diverse fabric that is wider Congolese culture. We must not extinguish this diversity - the very uniqueness that makes us who we are - and instead move to foster these languages and spread their knowledge to all in our nation."

LPD_allign_with_nationalists:0 "Align with Nationalists Parties"
LPD_allign_with_nationalists_desc:0 "Colonial rule has done much to foster a united Congolese nationalistic fervor in an area that has never before been so united. Under the oppressive boot of Imperialism, the people of our nation have slowly begun to look past old tribal lines and pool together as one Congolese people. Riding this wave of nationalist sentiment has been movements and parties like the Nzerians and MNC, rising to prominence and furthering their goals within the growing torrent of nationalism. We should align with these parties and organizations, for Papa Kimbangu shall be the Father of the new Congolese nation and people."

LPD_allign_with_radicals:0 "Align with Radical Cells"
LPD_allign_with_radicals_desc:0 "Simon Kimbangu has long been known to cooperate and reach out to all those in need of the Lord’s light, no matter their ideological conviction or personal beliefs. This openness has led Kimbangu to find strange allies and friends in numerous Socialist, Anarchist, and radical Liberal camps throughout the lands of the Congo, Gabon, and Angola. By reaching out to these allies and old compatriots, Nzgunza Kimbangu shall usher in egalitarianism and equality through both piety and a small red tint of Socialism."

LPD_global_peace_movement:0 "A True Eden"
LPD_global_peace_movement_desc:0 "The foundations of Ngunzism have been established, the main doctrine of Kimbangu’s dogma has been laid out, and the Congo has been relatively stabilized by the hand of this Holy Spirit. The Congo, this primordial paradise, shall be transformed into the True Eden - a natural paradise where the true children of God and nature can live in harmony, free from sin and conflict. Though creating this paradise shall be a great endeavor, our prophet is sure that this righteous destiny shall be achieved."

LPD_congolese_nationalism:0 "Bolingo, Mibeko, Misala"
LPD_congolese_nationalism_desc:0 "Love, Commandments, Work: the three pillars of Ngunzism. These three defining principles outline both our spiritual and national mission here in the Congo. We seek to establish a united identity thall all of our citizens can rally behind, and to do so shall require love and brotherhood, strict piety and adherence to the Gospel, and an absolute dedication to complete God’s works and tasks he asks of each of us as we journey through life. The mouthpiece of the Lord and all he commands shall be Ngunza Kimbangu, and under his doctrine, the Congo shall be made holy, free, and prosperous."

LPD_cleansing_of_sin:0 "Cleanse the Congo of Sin"
LPD_cleansing_of_sin_desc:0 "To fall to sin and vice is a tale as old as time. Gambling, smoking, dancing, expressive singing, nudity, indecency, and more shall be banned and cleansed from our society as we embrace our Puritan roots. Only accepted forms of expression shall be allowed, such as the singing of hymnals and bathing while clothed, for without these guidelines our nation would surely fall back into chaos and crisis once more."

LPD_ban_alcohol:0 "Put an End to Debauchery"
LPD_ban_alcohol_desc:0 "Debauchery and hedonism must be eliminated, for it only corrupts the mind, body, and most importantly, the soul. The largest gateways to these gravest of sins are drugs and alcohol. Cannabis, babine, khat, kwete, liquor, and more shall be completely banned from the nation, with all stockpiles of these sinful substances burned or otherwise destroyed and discarded. We shall save our people from temptation and replace the hole in their life with the light of Kimbangu and God."

LPD_new_legends:0 "New Legends"
LPD_new_legends_desc:0 "The history of the Congo and its surrounding areas is full of noble heroes and pious figures, such as the honorable Kimpa Vita, Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba, or the Christian Manikongos João I or Afonso I, who devoted their lives to pious acts and the word of God. These old heroes shall become the new legends, standing as new saints and holy figures under Ngunzism."

LPD_congolese_identity:0 "Form a United Congolese Identity"
LPD_congolese_identity_desc:0 "Simon Kimbagu has risen to become the true Father of the new unified Congolese identity. Under his watch, a cohesive Congolese culture has begun to blossom, centered around his church and his teachings. In the face of colonialism, our varied and numerous peoples persevered through Hell and back, and in the end have been rewarded with sovereignty and true national unity."

LPD_ascetic_piety:0 "Ascetic Piety"
LPD_ascetic_piety_desc:0 "Like the Ngunza, all in the Congo should strive to live an ascetic lifestyle, free from materialism and greed, want or desire. Indulgence shall become a thing of the past as our piety and faith forges a new shared sense of self-discipline and purpose as we all work together to foster this holy Eden we are charged with protecting."

LPD_anti_colonialism:0 "Anti-Colonialism Without Bloodshed"
LPD_anti_colonialism_desc:0 "As the Father of the Congolese nation and the herald of the Lord’s peaceful message, it is Kimbangu’s duty to ensure the smooth transition of this state from the hands of the former colonial apparatus into our new administration. Though long-angered and outraged, we must not give into temptation and raise arms against our former oppressors, while also not allowing the former colonials to act against our people with impunity. A delicate and precarious edge must be walked, as dictated by the Ngunza, in order to truly save the Congo and its people and bring true prosperity to this paradise."

LPD_african_unity:0 "The True Children of God"
LPD_african_unity_desc:0 "As the disciples of the Lord and of the Ngunza, we are the true children of God - His holy chosen people and His gift to the world. It was us who were modeled most directly in His image, and it is us who have inherited His kingdom. A land of milk and honey awaits us in our pristine homeland as we cleanse this land of sin and heretics, for none shall deny our birthright and our destiny."

LPD_black_jesus:0 "The Truth About Jesus"
LPD_black_jesus_desc:0 "Jesus Christ was a Black man! The Colonialists and Imperialist sinners that once plagued these lands would have you and the rest of the world believe otherwise, but how could such a lie make sense. The King of Kings was born in the Congo all those years ago, and the foundations of global Christian thought started here in this paradise, the true Eden. We shall spread this truth to the world and shout it to the heavens, for Jesus is humanity’s King, and that King is African!"

LPD_perform_miracles:0 "Papa Kimbangu’s Miracles"
LPD_perform_miracles_desc:0 "The Ngunza is said to hold many powerful abilities and powers granted to him by God himself. As the Holy Spirit given flesh, he is able to see the future and commune directly with God and Jesus Christ, who grant him the ability to perform miracles. Able to cure the blind, deaf, and mute, treat any illness, and halt any disease, Kimbangu is as bonafide a miracle worker as the Son of God himself. With these powers, and with the help of the growing Congolese government under him, these miracles shall be made a reality on a national scale as we work to care for each and everyone of our people and deliver them from suffering."

LPD_global_freedom_desc:0 "Christianity and the word of the Lord must not be bastardized and perverted anylong, for far too long has the Holy Gospel been used as a tool of oppression and control rather than the road to enlightenment, emancipation, and true bliss that it should be. We must be the heralds of the purified Christian doctrine and spread the word of the Ngunza throughout the African diaspora and the wider world as a whole. All children of this Earth shall be welcomed into the arms of Papa Kimbangu."

LPD_black_liberation_theology_desc:0 "Our religion is the hammer with which we shatter our shackles and break the chains of our oppression. Imperialism, colonialism, slavery - these demons have haunted our peoples for centuries, but under the light of the Lord and by the guidance of the Ngunza, the people of Africa shall be liberated and enlightened as they grow close to one another under the Holy Trinity of God, Jesus Christ, and Simon Kimbangu."

leopoldville.1.t:0 "An African Metropolis"
leopoldville.1.d:0 "Leopoldville stands as the largest city in the Congo, and now also stands as one of the sole areas of peace here in the collapsing Vrijstaat. Lying on the site of the old village of Kinshasa, which many native Congolese have co-opted as a nickname for the city, Leopoldville was first settled in 1881 and has since become one of the most important sites in the nation. With the German and Flandro-Wallonian mandate burning to ash and cinder, we have been thrust into the dark, isolated and cutoff from the rest of the Congo here on our only strip of Coast. With the Port of Matadi under our control, we have secured the only major seaport in the nation, and must use this as a lifeline until the terrible war is finished. \n\nThough the civilian council of the system is still in control in theory and the Ryckmans is still nominally in charge, in reality the Force Publique under General [LPD.getleader] rules over the city has and has enacted martial law. This military government now balances on a delicate edge between falling to the rising waves of unrest and anti-colonial sentiments and being conquered by the rebelling mercenaries and Congolese natives to the East. \n\nIf the residents of Leopoldville can survive this maelstrom without tearing the city apart, this cosmopolitan metropolis may just teach the rest of the Congo something about the benefits of cooperation. However, not all is as serene as it seems, as an old foe has broken out of their near 30-year prison sentence in Elisabethville as the region collapsed into war, and this old, infamous prophet has been seen slowly making his way back home. No matter the foe, domestic or foreign, this shining Gem of the Congo shall not falter!"
leopoldville.1.a:0 "Démocratie, Justice, Unité!"

leopoldville.2.t:0 "Our Allies in the Force Publique Make an Offer"
leopoldville.2.d:0 "The Force Publique-led military government in Leopoldville under General Armand Huyghé has petitioned our government to join their growing coalition of colonialist holdouts. If we accepted, we would be forced under the rule of the FP and Huyghé, throwing away our sovereignty for mere autonomy under their control. Alternatively, we could just deny this ludicrous request, but as a result we may have to face the wrath of the Force Publique on the open battlefield. How shall we respond?"
leopoldville.2.a:0 "We shall be far more profitable on our own."
leopoldville.2.b:0 "For the good of the colony and our profit margins, let it be so."

leopoldville.3.t:0 "A Shocking Denial"
leopoldville.3.d:0 "The fools at the UMHK have denied our request for unification, and now we are left with a choice. We could either merely forget this transgression and leave them to their own fate, or we could triumphantly march into Katanga and cut these traitors down for good. How shall we proceed?"
leopoldville.3.a:0 "The Force Publique will sort these traitors out."
leopoldville.3.b:0 "So much for colonial unity."

leopoldville.4.t:0 "An Accord is Reached"
leopoldville.4.d:0 "Our likeminded allies and countrymen in the UMHK have accepted our generous request at unification. With their acceptance, we shall move immediately towards integrating their lands and regime into our own. The Congo is one step closer to total unification and stability!"
leopoldville.4.a:0 "May our cooperation prove fruitful as colonial rule is reconsolidated."

leopoldville.5.t:0 "The Vrijstaat Calls Once More"
leopoldville.5.d:0 "The resurgent Vrijstaat has beaten back the mercenary and native hordes, and now stand as the dominant power in the Congo once again. With their victory, these imperialists have come knockin on our doors once more asking for us to reintegrate ourselves back into the wider Vrijstaat’s colonial government. If we were to accept, we would be fully integrated back into their borders, though given autonomy and extra incentives and benefits for agreeing to holster our weapons for the good of our colonists and the Force Publique’s command structure. However, we could just simply deny these fools instead, seeing as they already failed their previous mandate to rule, though doing so would likely incur their wrath. How shall we respond?"
leopoldville.5.a:0 "Together, for the good of the colony."
leopoldville.5.a:0 "What was the point of this revolt then?! Deny them at once!"
