### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_HUYGHE_DESC:0 "Chevalier Armand Huyghé de Mahenge has long served the Force Publique as one of its more respected generals. Born in 1871, Huyghé studied at the Royal Military Academy as soon as he was of age and joined the Flandro-Wallonian Army soon after in 1891, quickly transferring to the Force Publique in 1893 and making his way for the Congo. Serving initially under the Leopold regime, Huyghé learned hard and fast how to survive in these harsh jungles, teaching him the skills he would need to eventually become one of the FP’s most important figures. After serving heroically in the Weltkrieg both at Yser and in East Africa, Huyghé further made a name for himself as a tried and true career soldier. Following the war, the aging veteran Huyghé decided to take a step back from front-line command and has gotten himself a less-stressful position as head of the local Force Publique detachment that guards the Congolese metropolis of Leopoldville. With this relaxed position under his belt, Huyghé has worked diligently to maintain an unseen atmosphere of peace and stability within the city and its surrounding rural expanse - a talent that has proven far more relevant now that the Congo finds itself thrown into chaos. Under Armand Huyghé, Leopoldville is safe, but should this aging general slip up, who knows what shall happen to this Gem of the Congo he is sworn to protect."

### Ideas ###
LPD_mouth_of_the_congo_idea:0 "Control of Port Matadi"
LPD_mouth_of_the_congo_idea_desc:0 "We control what may be the most important piece of infrastructure in all of Congo - the Port of Matadi. Connected to our fair metropolis with the Matadi-Leopoldville Railway, this harbor serves as the chief seaport for the entire Vrijstaat, or did before this violent collapse. We must defend the port at all costs, for without it, both Leopoldville and the entire Congo shall be sealed off from the wider world."

LPD_martial_law_idea:0 "Rule of the Force Publique"
LPD_martial_law_idea_desc:0 "Though the civilian government is still nominally within control, the city of Leopoldville and its surrounding districts and zones of control exists under a strict regime and atmosphere of martial law led by the leading officers of the Force Publique left in the city. These soldiers and militias enforce a sense of order and calm within this African metropolis, creating a placid oasis of relative peace here in this chaotic Congo at the expense of civil liberty. The Force Publique must not take their rule too far or act too harshly, lest the locals throw of the looming spectre of the FP once and for all."

### Focuses ###

LPD_defend_the_city:0 "The Gem of the Vrijstaat"
LPD_defend_the_city_desc:0 "Whether you call it Leopoldville or Kinshasa, the varied people of this African metropolis have a great love for their city. As one of the largest cities on this continent, we rule over a vast amount of people but also have a massive amount of resources at our disposal. We must defend this gem of the Congo, no matter the cost, even as whispers of old foes surface among this chaos."

LPD_declare_independence:0 "The Declaration of Independence"
LPD_declare_independence_desc:0 "We have been cast adrift onto this sea of chaos that has replaced and consumed the once pristine and placid region of Congo. To consolidate our rule as we find our metropolis tossed into the role of a provisional government, we must issue a formal declaration of independence from the Congo colony. Under the leadership of General Armand Huyghé and the Force Publique, a new sovereign city-state shall rise here on Congo’s lone corridor to the sea. Whether you are a settler of Leopoldville or a Kinois of Kinshasa, we must band together as Congo falls to crisis!"

LPD_fate_of_the_north:0 "Fate of the Congo"
LPD_fate_of_the_north_desc:0 "To the East of our cosmopolitan haven, the rest of the Congo is embroiled in fierce war as mercenaries and natives rise against the colonialist machine. We must decide here and now what our policy towards these collapse-states shall be. Whether we soldier on to defend the colonial dream or decide to abandon our imperialism-born identity, we shall ever preserve this oasis of tranquility we have crafted."

LPD_unify_congo:0 "Congolese Unification"
LPD_unify_congo_desc:0 "The vast colonial apparatus that once ruled over this region we call Congo had long squandered their opportunity at creating a stable and cohesive nation. It falls onto us to crusade across the former lands of the Vrijstaat to create a truly pluralistic federation that can withstand the chaotic rigors of nation-building in Africa."

LPD_the_force_publique:0 "Free Reign of the Force Publique"
LPD_the_force_publique_desc:0 "The Force Publique has long served as the final line of defense between Congo and absolute chaos. Their oppressive but effective tactics are infamous throughout the colony, and despite their aging equipment and dwindling White officer corp, the natives in their employ make up for it with their savagery and tenacity. We must write a blank cheque to allow this last sword and shield of our safety free reign to do as they deem necessary to preserve our stability and safety."

LPD_support_the_government:0 "Recognize the Free State"
LPD_support_the_government_desc:0 "The Vrijstaat, or Free State, is the rightful Congolese government, and as such, our natural allies. Long has the city of Leopoldville served the Ryckmans Regime, and this cooperation shall continue. Our metropolis is the largest and most influential in all of Congo and serves as the colony’s only access to the sea; they simply can not survive without us, and we both know it."

LPD_rejoin_the_freestate:0 "The Question of Unification"
LPD_rejoin_the_freestate_desc:0 "Though our territorial extent is small, we are the bigger player in these coming negotiations. As the most important city and only seaport in all of Congo, the Ryckmans Regime will simply not survive without resources and opportunities that float into our harbor. We will approach them about unification, but if they choose to accept, we will hold their nation and all future ambitions of Congo by the balls."

LPD_team_switzerland:0 "Pledge Neutrality"
LPD_team_switzerland_desc:0 "To pick a side in this Congolese civil war would tear our nation apart. We must profess strict neutrality in this conflict as we work to secure our citizens from this maelstrom. We have far more important things to focus on instead of shooting our own countrymen in the mud."

LPD_be_nice_to_the_natives:0 "Metropolitan Cosmopolitanism"
LPD_be_nice_to_the_natives_desc:0 "Our fair city is massive, stretching across both sprawling urban and rural zones, holding thousands of souls and dozens of ethnic groups and minorities. We must account and care for each and every one of these groups, without favoritism, lest our entire city-state collapse into the same chaos that has befallen our fellow Congolese. All shall be welcome in our city limits as long as they abide by our rules."

LPD_defend_the_port:0 "The Mouth of the Congo"
LPD_defend_the_port_desc:0 "We control what may be the most important piece of infrastructure in all of Congo - the Port of Matadi. Connected to our fair metropolis with the Matadi-Leopoldville Railway, this harbor serves as the chief seaport for the entire Vrijstaat, or did before this violent collapse. We must defend the port at all costs, for without it, both Leopoldville and the entire Congo shall be sealed off from the wider world."

LPD_fortify_the_city:0 "From a City to a Fortress"
LPD_fortify_the_city_desc:0 "Our first and last stand against any enemy will likely take place at the gates of this city we call home, and as such, we must not allow it to fall. Leopoldville shall be transformed into an imposing and unassailable bastion. Walls shall be raised, bunkers and pillboxes constructed, and barbed wire and mines placed across our perimeter. Any foe wishing to take this city will have to crash through these defenses and cut us down to the last man."

LPD_new_status_quo:0 "The New Status Quo"
LPD_new_status_quo_desc:0 "We have established our rule over all of the former lands of the Vrijstaat, and now we stand as the new masters of the wild lands of Congo. The Force Publique is still nominally in charge, and has now declared an intention to slowly return to civilian rule. Embracing the ideas that saved our city and forged our new sense of unity, we shall spread these pluralistic principles to all people of the Congo as we struggle to repair the schism that caused the crisis we have endeavored through."

LPD_strike_a_balance:0 "Strike a Balance"
LPD_strike_a_balance_desc:0 "We must take a measured hand to our rule over this new Congolese state, for we are in untested waters. The refined Force Publique shall serve as the shepherds of this new nation, slowly building up the necessary bureaucracy and administrations needed to transition to a more permanent state. By balancing a need for stability with a desire for freedom and pluralism, the FP will attempt to lay the foundations of our new state."

LPD_promise_not_to_do_leopold_things:0 "Never Another Leopold"
LPD_promise_not_to_do_leopold_things_desc:0 "The horrors of the reign of King Leopold are still fresh in the minds of all Congolese, especially the natives, forever scaring the image of colonial rule and sullying the word of Europeans in the minds of many natives. We must make clear to our new populace that the madness of the Leopold regime will never be allowed to return to these lands, and that the remaining colonists and settlers are here to contribute to this new society as equally as their African countrymen."

LPD_democracy_in_quotation_marks:0 "A Budding ‘Democracy’"
LPD_democracy_in_quotation_marks_desc:0 "To make good on our promises, the Force Publique and General Armand Huyghé have decided to make way for ‘fair and free’ elections. Though only accepted, non-radical parties have been allowed to run and some rumors of tampering have circulated around, the FP assures us that this is truly the arrival of bonafide democracy here in Congo."

LPD_local_autonomy:0 "Tribal Autonomies"
LPD_local_autonomy_desc:0 "Within our borders exist many native kingdoms, chiefdoms, and barely-contacted tribes. In order to quell any potential unrest from these masses, we shall grant them large amounts of autonomy, giving them free reign to rule their own people as they please. They will still be forced to pay some sort of tithe to our government like any of our citizens, but given their positions, monetary compensation is not always feasible or even the best option. Any groups that do not wish to or can not pay can instead offer their produced goods, manpower, or anything else, and in return, they can largely do as they please."

LPD_congolese_federalism:0 "Congolese Federalism"
LPD_congolese_federalism_desc:0 "A true Congolese Federation once seemed like a fantasy, but now this idea can become a reality. Embracing our roots as cosmopolitan people in a massively diverse region, we shall attempt an experiment unlike any seen in Africa so far - a true democratic federation. Constituent ‘states’ shall range from autonomous kingdoms to newly created administrative provinces. Emulating larger nations such as the United States and the Kaiserreich, we will create a true, united federation of Congolese states."

### Events ###

leopoldville.1.t:0 "An African Metropolis"
leopoldville.1.d:0 "Leopoldville stands as the largest city in the Congo, and now also stands as one of the sole areas of peace here in the collapsing Vrijstaat. Lying on the site of the old village of Kinshasa, which many native Congolese have co-opted as a nickname for the city, Leopoldville was first settled in 1881 and has since become one of the most important sites in the nation. With the German and Flandro-Wallonian mandate burning to ash and cinder, we have been thrust into the dark, isolated and cutoff from the rest of the Congo here on our only strip of Coast. With the Port of Matadi under our control, we have secured the only major seaport in the nation, and must use this as a lifeline until the terrible war is finished. \n\nThough the civilian council of the system is still in control in theory and the Ryckmans is still nominally in charge, in reality the Force Publique under General [LPD.getleader] rules over the city has and has enacted martial law. This military government now balances on a delicate edge between falling to the rising waves of unrest and anti-colonial sentiments and being conquered by the rebelling mercenaries and Congolese natives to the East. \n\nIf the residents of Leopoldville can survive this maelstrom without tearing the city apart, this cosmopolitan metropolis may just teach the rest of the Congo something about the benefits of cooperation. However, not all is as serene as it seems, as an old foe has broken out of their near 30-year prison sentence in Elisabethville as the region collapsed into war, and this old, infamous prophet has been seen slowly making his way back home. No matter the foe, domestic or foreign, this shining Gem of the Congo shall not falter!"
leopoldville.1.a:0 "Démocratie, Justice, Unité!"

leopoldville.2.t:0 "Our Allies in the Force Publique Make an Offer"
leopoldville.2.d:0 "The Force Publique-led military government in Leopoldville under General Armand Huyghé has petitioned our government to join their growing coalition of colonialist holdouts. If we accepted, we would be forced under the rule of the FP and Huyghé, throwing away our sovereignty for mere autonomy under their control. Alternatively, we could just deny this ludicrous request, but as a result we may have to face the wrath of the Force Publique on the open battlefield. How shall we respond?"
leopoldville.2.a:0 "We shall be far more profitable on our own."
leopoldville.2.b:0 "For the good of the colony and our profit margins, let it be so."

leopoldville.3.t:0 "A Shocking Denial"
leopoldville.3.d:0 "The fools at the UMHK have denied our request for unification, and now we are left with a choice. We could either merely forget this transgression and leave them to their own fate, or we could triumphantly march into Katanga and cut these traitors down for good. How shall we proceed?"
leopoldville.3.a:0 "The Force Publique will sort these traitors out."
leopoldville.3.b:0 "So much for colonial unity."

leopoldville.4.t:0 "An Accord is Reached"
leopoldville.4.d:0 "Our likeminded allies and countrymen in the UMHK have accepted our generous request at unification. With their acceptance, we shall move immediately towards integrating their lands and regime into our own. The Congo is one step closer to total unification and stability!"
leopoldville.4.a:0 "May our cooperation prove fruitful as colonial rule is reconsolidated."

leopoldville.5.t:0 "The Vrijstaat Calls Once More"
leopoldville.5.d:0 "The resurgent Vrijstaat has beaten back the mercenary and native hordes, and now stand as the dominant power in the Congo once again. With their victory, these imperialists have come knockin on our doors once more asking for us to reintegrate ourselves back into the wider Vrijstaat’s colonial government. If we were to accept, we would be fully integrated back into their borders, though given autonomy and extra incentives and benefits for agreeing to holster our weapons for the good of our colonists and the Force Publique’s command structure. However, we could just simply deny these fools instead, seeing as they already failed their previous mandate to rule, though doing so would likely incur their wrath. How shall we respond?"
leopoldville.5.a:0 "Together, for the good of the colony."
leopoldville.5.a:0 "What was the point of this revolt then?! Deny them at once!"
