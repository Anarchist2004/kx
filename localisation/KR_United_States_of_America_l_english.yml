### Parties ###
USA_totalist_party: "Socialist Party of America"
USA_totalist_party_long: "Socialist Party of America (Vanguardist) - §LIn addition to its mainstream syndicalist wing, the SPA also has a wing containing various authoritarian-leaning syndicalists, marxists, and more. These so-called "Vanguardists" are a small but vocal minority within the party, and the party's detractors often point to them as a cause for alarm. However, this does a disservice to the faction's diversity. William Foster, identifying as a syndicalist but espousing quite authoritarian views, advocates for a social revolution as well as collectivization, and is generally seen as the most radical member of the SPA. Recently, he has even gone so far as to call more moderate members of his party "reactionaries". Earl Browder, once a close friend of Foster, has since distanced himself from syndicalism somewhat, supporting the retention of many old American institutions such as small businesses, while also being somewhat socially conservative. Known as a negotiator, his focus is on industry and the economy, and this may win him support from other SPA factions. Lesser-known James Burnham advocates a technocratic society, in which a new managerial class will inevitably rise to replace the old aristocratic classes. He represents the most conservative Vanguardists as well as various breakaways from other factions of the SPA.§!"
USA_syndicalist_party: "Socialist Party of America"
USA_syndicalist_party_long: "Socialist Party of America (IWW) - §LThe Industrial Workers of the World was founded in 1905 in Chicago, Illinois. Its main founders were Eugene Debs, Bill Haywood, Mary Harris "Mother" Jones, and Daniel De Leon, among others. Their motto "an injury to one is an injury to all" can be seen as representative of their greater party goals, which are first and foremost advocation for greater worker's rights and a new union-oriented economy. Today, the IWW is one of the most important groups within the SPA, and some would argue that it makes up its mainstream, for this wing of the party is currently the most popular. This could easily change, however. Of course, within such a faction, there are sure to be disagreements. Those who adhere to the IWW message generally identify themselves as syndicalists or anarcho-syndicalists, though they have different visions for how they would run the country. Bill Haywood has united this faction for now, with hopes to bring radical changes to the United States. As a result of this and the recent strife in the country, the SPA has exploded in popularity. Their main base of support is in the Steel Belt, which is now popularly called the Red Belt for the popularity of the SPA in the region. Due to his broad support in this area and the relative disunity of other regions, some even theorize that Haywood could win it all in the coming election.§!"
USA_radical_socialist_party: "Socialist Party of America"
USA_radical_socialist_party_long: "Socialist Party of America (Independent) - §LThere are many leftists within the SPA who do not explicitly identify as syndicalists and have more moderate tendencies. This wing of the party is popularly called the "Nationalist" wing or the "Social Patriots". It traces some of its beliefs to author Edward Bellamy as well as old Nationalist Clubs. They are based more in social organizations than they are in unions, and this probably reflects their support among the middle-class rather than urban workers. The American Independence League is the strongest of these organizations, and with the other factions, they have differed from the syndicalists in their support for middle-class guilds, values of humanism, and a generally utopian vision for how American should be run. Norman Thomas is their main leader, inspired by the writings of Bellamy, though he is not alone in this faction of course. Overall though, their distinctiveness from other factions of the SPA makes them notable enough to be considered their own, and in some time, perhaps they will come to prominence within the party as a whole.§!"
USA_social_democrat_party: "Progressive Party"
USA_social_democrat_party_long: "Progressive Party -  §LProgressives in America have a long and proud history. For all their efforts though, they have little to show for it on the national stage. Theodore Roosevelt is pointed to as a main Progressive figure, yet his bid for the presidency in the Bull Moose Party was ultimately unsuccessful. Other Progressives have tried and failed to win the presidency in recent decades, most notably Wisconsin Progresive Robert M. La Folelette. Now, with the country at its breaking point, they may finally have a shot. George Norris, popularly known as the "Fighting Liberal", is quite powerful within the Progressive Party. His support of a "Fair Deal" in the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt's old idea, as well as his populist appeals to farmers, have made him the likely nominee for the party in the coming election. While they represent a platform that is distasteful to most elites, some are beginning to wonder if they would be preferable to the extremists that plague the country, and see them as a party that could address the concerns of most voters while also keeping the peace.§!"
USA_social_liberal_party: "Republican Party"
USA_social_liberal_party_long: "Republican Party (Liberal) - §LThe Republican Party has experienced significant success since its inception in the days of Abraham Lincoln. The recent presidency of Woodrow Wilson has perhaps put a dent in this success, but the Republican Party still stands strong. However, the events of the past few years have endangered the continue dominance of the Republican Party, and although sitting President Herbert Hoover is himself a Republican, there is no guarantee the party will win the upcoming election. In fact, the party is somewhat split between different wings, particularly on the issue of trade: the more protectionist wing, represented by Hoover and his vice president, Charles Curtis, and the more socially focused and free-trade minded liberal wing, represented by rising star Alf Landon. Both sides believe in a stimulus program to get the country back on its feet, although notably, Curtis is more focused on this in his speeches, whereas Landon points to tariffs as the main culprit behind the economic crisis. Landon is in a tough spot: he has found it difficult to criticize the incumbent party, since it is his party, and any critique of them could turn into a critique of him. The best he can do now is try to defeat Curtis and move forward at the head of a revitalized Republican Party. Even if he succeeds however, he has daunting four years ahead of him...§!"
USA_market_liberal_party: "Republican Party"
USA_market_liberal_party_long: "Republican Party (Conservatives) - §LThe Republican Party has experienced significant success since its inception in the days of Abraham Lincoln. The recent presidency of Woodrow Wilson has perhaps put a dent in this success, but the Republican Party still stands strong. However, the events of the past few years have endangered the continue dominance of the Republican Party, and although sitting President Herbert Hoover is himself a Republican, there is no guarantee the party will win the upcoming election. In fact, the party is somewhat split between different wings, particularly on the issue of trade: the more protectionist wing, represented by Hoover and his vice president, Charles Curtis, and the more socially focused and free-trade minded liberal wing, represented by rising star Alf Landon. Both sides believe in a stimulus program to get the country back on its feet, although notably, Curtis is more focused on this in his speeches, whereas Landon points to tariffs as the main culprit behind the economic crisis. Curtis is well known and quite popular within insider circles, and his position as Hoover's vice president has won him more friends than one might expect. However, Hoover's record has put a bit of a splotch on Curtis's record, and he will have to work hard to shrug off a challenge to his left from Alf Landon in the party primary. If he can accomplish this though, his advisors are confident his hopeful message will beat the doom-and-gloom of Garner and the extremists that threaten to sap support from both major parties. But, Curtis himself wonders if he can accomplish a recovery where Hoover could not, and it is yet to be seen how he will differ in a significant way from his friend. Whispers of a new government intervenionism just around the corner have aroused anxiety in his advisors, yet his supporters have welcomed the rumors with significant enthusiasm, and perhaps this will be his path to victory.§!"
USA_social_conservative_party: "Democratic Party"
USA_social_conservative_party_long: "Democratic Party - §LThe Democratic Party is old, yet Hoover's time in office has reinvigorated the party. Prominent Democrats see the current crisis as the perfect opportunity to regain the White House, yet they are not free from challenges. For all their faults, the Republican Party has remained a unified force in electoral politics. Meanwhile, an offshoot branch of the Democratic Party, led by "Alfala Bill" Murray, threatens to tear the Democratic Party in half. Their base in the South could all but cripple the Democrats in the popular vote, if not the electoral college as well. Worse, the Democrats have also suffered in traditionally friendly urban areas, like New York City, which have gone over to the Socialist Party of America. Speaker of the House John Nance Garner is not in the mood for negotiation. His platform is focused on decrying socialist radicals in the North, immigrants in the cities, and minorities in the South. The interventionist proposals of Curtis and Landon are anathema to Garner; he believes they would give too much ground to socialists and populists, as he says Hoover has in his time in office. He has deemed austerity the only solution to the nation's economic woes, noting that if the country tightened its belts, perhaps it could finally function. If he wants to win though, Garner will have to expand his base beyond its traditional supporters, or perhaps win back disaffected supporters who left with Murray. This will be no easy task, and Garner certainly has a hard task ahead of him. But, if he wins, Garner is confident that his hardline strategy towards extremists will ultimately save the country. His fellow house members hope he is right, for if he fails, the country will surely fall apart. For now, all eyes are on Garner.§!"
USA_authoritarian_democrat_party: "America First Party"
USA_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "America First Party - §LThe America First Party is a new phenomenon in American politics, but in its short existence, it has managed to explode onto the political scene like a bomb. Louisiana Governor and now Senator Huey Long, known as the "Kingfish", has solidifed control over his state, and now has plans to run for president. He has sharply criticized President Hoover's attempts to ameliorate the crisis, instead advocating his own program of "Share Our Wealth". This program would limit personal net worth and yearly income, give old-age pensions to those over sixty years of age, work to guarantee free education for all, and redistribute wealth from the one percent to the rest of the population through taxes to pay for it. Long has already become a star in American political circles, and his speeches draw thousands of onlookers from Los Angeles to New York City. His greatest support has come in the Great Plains, the birthplace of Populism. Farmers and workers alike in this region, dealing with the brunt of the Dust Bowl crisis, have flocked to Long. However, his support is not limited to these states, and Long has enough support to potentially even win the upcoming election, assuming his anti-establishment message can sap enough support from the major parties and new party challengers. Should Long be elected though, he will face significant challenges. For one, opposition from the establishment would be rather strong, and Hoover has barely even acknowledged the AFP's existence. Further, should Long win, it is almost certain the result would be denounced as illegitimate by other parties, and this could cause conflict. Whatever happens though, the Kingfish and his AFP are ready, and anyone who underestimates them would be making a grave mistake.§!"
USA_paternal_autocrat_party: "Old Democratic Party"
USA_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Old Democratic Party - §LDuring the Red Scare in President Woodrow Wilson's administration, syndicalists and other leftists were suppressed. However, the Republicans eased this pressure, and these groups have swelled in popularity once again. The Democrats, for their part, have done little to oppose this, and it seems that they are too weak, too corrupt, or both to deal with it. As such, former Oklahoma Governor "Alfalfa" Bill Murray has decided to lead anxious Dixiecrats to a new party, called the Old Democratic Party due to its espousal of older Democratic Party values. He has even decided to run for president with the motto of fighting "Communists, Corporations and Miscegenation". Murray's fiery speeches denouncing banks and political corruption have won him significant support in the South, but he has not accomplished this alone. The Ku Klux Klan, working in conjunction with the NDWL, has become a major force within the party, and have brought in more support than Murray had ever dreamed of. There are also the corporatist Fordists, who have given Murray a base outside the South as well, mainly among disaffected Democrats and Republicans in Northern cities. For now, these factions are unified under Murray's leadership, but if he wins the election, there is sure to be tension. These are the least of his worries though, as the ODP has even been ignored by some Southern congressmen, and they are rarely taken seriously on the national stage. Further, if the party can win in 1936, it is certain that there will be challenges to the ODP's leadership, and the situation might lead to armed conflict. Regardless, Murray is certain that the current system is failing, and he believes he is the only one who can save the country from itself.§!"
USA_national_populist_party: "Old Democratic Party"
USA_national_populist_party_long: "Old Democratic Party (National White League) - §LThe National Democratic White League is one of the foremost factions of the Old Democratic Party. Their power emerged during the recent growth of Ku Klux Klan membership, and now they have millions of members across the country, ready to fight if need be. The NDWL generally supports an anti-syndicalist, anti-Black, and anti-Semitic platform that is more harsh in nature than the mainstream ODP platform. As such, they are often used to attack the ODP as far-right extremists, though this does not account for the diversity within the NDWL itself. The Young Klan is the newer of the two Klan factions, and it aims to modernize the organization, present itself as moderate and diplomatic, and appeal to groups the Klan failed to appeal to in the past. The Old Klan, modeled after the original Ku Klux Klan, has worked with the Black Legion and is generally seen as the more brutal of the two Klan factions, but also less aristocratic than its Young Klan counterpart. Meanwhile, Herbert Armstrong leads the fringes of the NDWL, under a unique movement of "Christian Identity". Armstrong draws significantly on the Bible and Christianity to justify the extreme positions he advocates, and he has his own vision for how America should be run.§!"

USA_HOTB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The United States is in the midst of its worst political turbulence since 1865. Few expected this after America successfully avoided the Weltkrieg but the rise of syndicalism fomented a Red Scare and an economy depressed by nonstop worker strikes and political crackdowns. Herbert Hoover won the 1928 election promising a return to normalcy but with the Great Panic of 1928 occurring he has made no headway and his re-election via the House of Representatives has only damaged his legitimacy. Now US politics is challenged by numerous radical forces, all of whom promise in their own way an end to politics as we know it if elected."

### Leader Bios ###
## United States of America ##
POLITICS_RONALD_REAGAN_DESC: "Growing up and out of the rural reaches of Illinois, Ronald Reagan had first caught the public’s eye with his soothing voice and witty personality, culminating in a uniquely charismatic figure that many Americans would tune in to listen time to time. Not soon after the outbreak of the Second American Civil War, Reagan would find himself day by day at the front end of the microphone, broadcasting to the loyal men and women of the United States and offering a source of comfort to the soldiers on the federal frontlines. In such little time the radio star’s popularity skyrocketed, and after the war had ended he would ride his fame all the way to the Oval Office, as a ‘man of the people’, and a stalwart reminder of the United State’s perseverance against extremism. "
POLITICS_JACK_REED_DESC: "A writer, a trade union leader, a Senator, a journalist and a Syndicalist - John 'Jack' Reed is many things. After the death of his predecessor, Alexander Berkman, this fiery radical socialist took the reins of the American syndicalist movement, and he has led this organisation to great success. While this long path from journalist to President has brought him many enemies, it also brought him many allies. He is determined to become the American version of Sebastian Faure, the founder of the Commune of France - a charismatic, unifying Syndicalist demagogue who shall turn his country into what he perceives to be a perfect society."
POLITICS_JOHN_NANCE_GARNER_DESC: "John Nance Garner IV, known by his peers as 'Cactus Jack', is a lawyer and long-serving Representative from Texas and the new President of the United States. He is a man of the Democratic establishment, a mildly conservative politician, and, most importantly, a fervent supporter of democracy. This Texan judge sees no reason in compromise with either the left or the right."
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_DESC: "Herbert Clark Hoover is the 30th President of the United States. However, before becoming president, he was best known as an engineer, businessman, and the man in charge of the 'Commission for Relief' in Flanders-Wallonia. In addition to that record, he is also known for his two failed attempts to become the Republican nominee for President, losing once in 1920 to Leonard Wood and again in 1924 to Irvine Lenroot. Both Republicans would go on to lose their races, to Woodrow Wilson and A. Mitchell Palmer respectively. Hoover became the Republican nominee in 1928 as a compromise candidate between the Conservatives and Liberals within the party. With Hoover's victory in the 1928 Election, Republicans celebrated their victory, but their cheers would not last. As the United States was still in an economic slump, and began experiencing a major environmental catastrophy, that was and still is destroying the American farming industry. Part of Hoover's 28' campaign was the re-legalization of the SPA party, however, ever since the SPA entered into American political society, the growth of worker strikes (heavily linked to the SPA) and failures of negiotation have seen America's industry slow to a grinding halt. Hoover's policies of actively intervening in the economy and increasing the national debt has brought little success in improving the situtation overall. His victory in 1932 saw little celebrations as it was decided by a House vote, and this has made him quite possibly the most despised man in America. Everyone from Democrats to the ODP, SPA, and AFP are now calling him 'The Failed Humanitarian.'"
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_2_DESC: "Herbert Clark Hoover is the 30th President of the United States. With his suprise victory in the 1936 election, he has become the second president in the 20th Century to break the tradtional two terms of the Presidency. Hoover now stands guard over a nation on the brink of another Civil War. Despite all the economic interventionism that Hoover made over the last two terms, it has not done much for the United States. According to some, including his new vice president, it actually made the problem worse. Hoover now acknowledges the dangerous position the country is in and has begun to listen to his advisors such as Vice President Knox, his new cabinet, General Douglas MacArthur, and Director J. Edgar Hoover to help him solve the various economic, societal and political crisises that now plague the United States of America."
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_3_DESC: "Herbert Clark Hoover is the 30th President of the United States, and is the second president in the 20th Century to have three terms in office. Many thought that when Hoover won in 1936, the United States would be forever destroyed, and throughout his term it looked like it was inevitable at various points. However, the important thing to many Americans at the end of the day is that it didn't occur. Hoover has gone from the most liked to the most hated and then back to the most liked politican and president in recent American memory. With the failures of his previous terms long gone, along with many of the problems facing America throughout the 30s, President Hoover and his cabinet look to the future of what this great nation can accomblish with his remaining time in office. These past three terms have aged Hoover to such a degree that the term of adorement used by the public to describe Hoover is 'The Grand Old Man.'"
POLITICS_FRANK_KNOX_DESC: "William Franklin Knox is now the President of the United States. Knox is known for his service to the United States during the Spanish-American War, where he served in the Rough Riders under former President Theodore Roosevelt. Along with his service to the United States, Knox also became quite renowed for owning and operating several newspapers across the Midwest. Frank Knox is now in the most powerful position in America, and as a staunch internationalist and anti-isolationist, he will atempt to prepare the United States for whatever may come next, opposed to what previous administrations have done over the past 30 years."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_DESC: "Son of Lieutenant general and civil war veteran Arthur MacArthur, young Douglas was prepared from an early life for military service. Instilled with a concern for the common man out west, and a hatred for former Confederates due to harassment in West Point, Douglas became a fine soldier. After serving in the Philippines, diplomatic posts in Japan, and defusing potential war in Mexico, MacArthur became Field Marshall of the Philippine Army. The strategic importance of the Philippines introduced MacArthur to Washington politics, and his set of allies and rivals. Although he adamantly denies being a politician, he has a good relationship with Hoover, conservative Democrats, and William Hearst. Despite his occasional admiration of populist James Coxey, MacArthur is willing to use deadly force against socialists, southern populists, and the forces that perpetuate political gridlock in Washington."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_TWO_DESC: "Son of Lieutenant general and civil war veteran Arthur MacArthur, young Douglas was prepared from an early life for military service. Instilled with a concern for the common man out west, and a hatred for former Confederates due to harassment in West Point, Douglas became a fine soldier. After serving in the Philippines, diplomatic posts in Japan, and defusing potential war in Mexico, MacArthur became Field Marshall of the Philippine Army. The strategic importance of the Philippines introduced MacArthur to Washington politics, and his set of allies and rivals. Although he adamantly denies being a politician, he has a good relationship with Hoover, conservative Democrats, and William Hearst. Despite his occasional admiration of populist James Coxey, MacArthur is willing to use deadly force against socialists, southern populists, and the forces that perpetuate political gridlock in Washington and elsewhere. This is a fact his men have learned and his enemies have learned even more so in recent times, but with the US defeated in the East, now only the Western Command Center remains. MacArthur has fled West and he seems to be a changed man, a new gleam in his eye. His anger and ultranationalism have only increased as a result of his loss in the East and he is now determined to win the war, whatever it takes..."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_D_LEAHY_DESC: "William Daniel Leahy, born in 1875 and growing up in the Midwest, may seem out of place in a nation of radicals, revolutionaries, and tyrants. However, as Leahy ambitiously climbed the ranks of the U.S. Navy, he always remained loyal to his country first and foremost. Like his fellow military men, Leahy was troubled by the growing chaos in the United States, and when Douglas MacArthur couped the government, Leahy was silent. As MacArthur began to crack down on both Congress and the U.S. Navy, however, enforcing his will on both groups, Leahy became more and more disenchanted with the American Caesar. When circumstances spiraled out of control, with MacArthur's actions threatening the war effort, Leahy decided it was time to take action. Now, in the aftermath of the navy coup, Leahy leads a fractured government and a broken people in what seems like an unwinnable conflict. Despite this, Leahy has friends, both in Washington and in the West, and his committment to democracy has soothed many who originally felt alienated by MacArthur's leadership. With grim determination and a sharp mind, Leahy will do whatever he must to restore democracy to his battered country."
POLITICS_ERNEST_J_KING_DESC: "When Douglas MacArthur took power in Washington, he did not anticipate the danger that an admiral could pose, and yet Admiral Ernest Joseph King has proved to be the cause of MacArthur's demise. King, a brilliant yet arrogant man with a love for the sea and the air alike, has had a remarkable few years. It seemed that his career would be fairly unremarkable until, in the mid-1930's, King was promoted along with many other officers in an effort to help deal with the growing extremist movements in the country. However, King, believing democracy itself to be the cause of the nation's woes, sided with MacArthur when the man came to power. When MacArthur began to lord over the U.S. Navy and worse, King himself, it was a step too far. Believing that MacArthur was neglecting the navy to the detriment of the war effort, and resenting the control of an army man, King led a coup against the government. Now that he runs the country, King has many plans. First and foremost, a significant investment in the U.S. Navy is just what King believes is needed to win the war. When that is done, though, King has further plans for America. Most of all, he wishes to see America take its rightful place in the world, and to do so, he is more than willing to step on potential rivals, especially the scheming remnants of the old Entente..."
POLITICS_HUEY_LONG_DESC: "In a world where politics is largely defined by strict ideological lines, one might think that a man like Huey Long has no place in it, yet it is the opposite that he has proven through his career.\n\nBorn in a small village in North Louisiana, Long was exposed to poverty and precariousness from an early age. He showed it after his election as governor of his state, always putting the interests of the poorest Americans before himself through numerous social programs, and for that he did not hesitate to use the big means when the situation required it. However, he was greatly opposed by the Establishment, who called him a dangerous demagogic, authoritarian and corrupt populist. This led the so-called 'Kingfish' to found his own party, the America First Party, a populist, patriotic party based on pragmatism with the main proposed social measure being the extensive 'Share Our Wealth' program. This party does not fit into a traditional classification system, bringing together center-left progressives as well as right-wing Christian populist conservatives, all united by their loyalty to Kingfish and their disdain for socialists who they consider to be far from the spirit of America.\n\nAccompanied by loyal 'Minutemen' and the poor of America, leading a grand alliance of populists and sitting on a huge political machine encompassing the entire Midwest, the Kingfish is determined to shape America and democracy in his own image, no matter what the cost may be."
POLITICS_HUEY_LONGDONG_DESC: "Huey Long barely escaped capture when the American Union State fell. Only our quick action was able to save him. Not content to disappear into the dust bin of history, he has now shown up in our capital promising to use his political talent and charisma to keep the Progressive Party in power for a decade or more. He has renounced many of his previous beliefs in favor of a more mainstream Progressive platform, though he insists on keeping his "Share the Wealth" program. His promise is quite alluring and his prowess is obvious, though we must keep a close eye on him..."
POLITICS_FLOYD_OLSON_DESC: "Despite his rural upbringing, Floyd Olson has been able to see the great diversity in America through travel and activism.Working as a Shabbos goy, an IWW stevedore, and finally an attorney pushed Olson towards Progressivism in the 1920s. Olson joined up with Robert LaFollete’s Progressive Party following the 1924 election. Olson worked tirelessly for the next decade in order to gain allies for the Progressive Party, stopping only to seek treatment for his stomach ulcers in 1930. A surprisingly influential Governor of Minnesota and a national advocate for peace catapulted him into the White House on a bipartisan ticket against radicalism."
POLITICS_QUENTIN_ROOSEVELT_DESC: "The youngest son of former president Theodore Roosevelt, Quentin's early life was groomed for political activism in his father's Republican Party. Quentin, however, wished to be a pilot, and was injured in his training in 1918. Seeing his family and country being torn apart in recent years, Quentin pushed into politics and served as New York's Senator during the fateful year of 1936. Now that the great national disaster is over, Quentin's plan to follow in his father's footsteps and push for a new American Fair Deal."
POLITICS_CHARLES_CURTIS_DESC: "As Herbert Hoover's vice president, Charles Curtis is one of the most recognizable faces in America. His protectionism and moderation on social issues would have made him a more than acceptable choice in normal times, but these are not normal times. Regardless, as the times have changed, so too has Charles Curtis, and he has emerged with a plan to address the crises facing the country. Now that he is president, Curtis will attempt to both continue Hoover's legacy and implement "Home Rule Negotiations" in an attempt to solve the political crisis. On the economic front, new tariffs and a work sharing plan are what Curtis believes the country needs to get back on track. His status as the nation's first Native American president and his poor health alike have been largely ignored, with attention instead being placed on his economic plans. The people cry out for help, and if Curtis is unable to address their concerns, the country will suffer greatly. However, if Curtis does succeed in restoring order, he will usher in a new era of prosperity that will redeem the Republican Party and enshrine him as one of America's all-time greatest presidents."
POLITICS_ALF_LANDON_DESC: "Alf Landon was a successful entrepreneur in the oil business long before his entry into politics. This self-starter led to the creation of the United States Oil and Gas Association, a lobbying group associated with Standard Oil that Landon remains attached to this day. What initially seemed like a poor decision to break with Hoover's non-intervnetionalist position at the 11th hour before election day turned to his advantage when the Republican Party came with him. Even Hoover has begrudgingly come to endorse Landon, despite this personal betrayal of confidence. Now despite his humble demeanour Landon has proven to be the soft voice of confident economic recovery that America wanted. Although his strong ties with the oil lobby makes him an enemy of both socialists and Longists."
POLITICS_WENDELL_WILLKIE_DESC: "Wendell Willkie has been many things in his life before presidency. He began as a William Jennings fan, a populist-minded Democrat. He became a socialist in college, and rumors persist that he seduced Soong Mei Ling during a diplomatic visit to China in 1933. Not to mention an affair with writer Irita Van Doren. He continued to stand out when he opposed Democrats to push for a bank holiday when the Great Depression hit. This support for financial institutions and his assertions that government aid should not interfere with market competition made the difference in his election campaign. There is also his support for integrating the civil service and armed forces, which has put him at odds with many other Democrats. It remains to be seen whether this multitalented man can handle the many roles of the presidency."
POLITICS_HARRY_BYRD_DESC: "Whereas many southern populists fell to Huey Long's charms and deserted the Democratic Party, Harry F. Byrd stood his ground. Harry Byrd was born into a Virginian Brahmin family with a direct line to the American Revolution. A firm believer in segregation and fiscally conservative policies intended to reduce the national debt. Holding firm to his anti-Keynesian policies, Harry Byrd won as the stabilizing image of American traditional establishment."
POLITICS_PHILIP_FOLLETTE_DESC: "A professional Wisconsin progressive, Philip is the most successful of the politically active La Follette family. A friend and former mentor to Floyd Olson, who had been convinced to join the Farmer Labor Party in order to continue to help his state in need. With the spectre of isolationism that Philip's father Robert stood for, Philip nonetheless stands behind the need for a strong military in the Americas as well as the full extent and strength of the government as promoted by the Farmer Labor Party."
POLITICS_HENRY_WALLLACE_DESC: "Humble beginnings as an Iowa farmer did not dissuade a young Henry Wallace from seeing the world and gaining worldly insight. His fortune came from inventing hybrid corn breeds, a major innovation that allowed Wallace him travel the world. Henry visited India and became acquainted with Theosophy, a Hinduist school of thought popular in Russia that draws elements from Christian Anarchism and Socialism. These teachings ultimately alienated him from mainstream socialism and pushed him into the Farmer Labor Party when he returned. Wallace portrays himself above all else a pragmatic economist and an agricultural expert capable of the agrarian reform America needs."
POLITICS_JAMES_MURRAY_DESC: "A great controversy surrounded the election of James E. Murray during his election campaign. Tabloids and Republicans all came at Murray claiming that he cannot run for President due to being born in Canada. The truth of these statements may never be known, but his life prior to attending NYU is shrouded in mystery. His life began in earnest when Murray won the Governorship of Montana in 1933. His term as a Democrat was marked by an unusually cooperate relationship with unions and his bold belief that economic reform must disrupt a market if the market is failing."
POLITICS_ALBEN_BARKLEY_DESC: "Alben draws from over thirty years of political experience within the Democrat party and his own smart judgement. While Alben supported Wilson's reforms, he opposed McAdoo's attempts to reverse those policies. After several failed national election bids and a steady voting record, Alben was the right piece on the chess board in this election to gain the White House for the Democrats."
POLITICS_RICHARD_RUSSELL_DESC: "The final ascent into the White House by Richard Russell Jr. is the final stroke in a long game that extends even before his time in the Democrat party. Russell Jr. has accumulated the right combination of titles in the US Navy, in the Georgian House of Representatives, and the US Congress to secure universal respect. His focus that de-segregation should happen entirely on southern terms proved popular with a national audience. Time will tell whether this position is sustainable."
POLITICS_GLEN_TAYLOR_DESC: "Being President was just as much a surprise to Glen Taylor as it was to the voting public. The man that had wanted at one point to be a wandering preacher and then a country singer had finally reached a position that befitted his skills. Taylor was known in Congress as a compassionate economist and advocate of progressive policies and singing to children on the steps of the Capitol. Taylor's compassion fuled his opposition to segregation, and despite his eccentricities he has endeared himself to the American people, which is all he ever wanted."
POLITICS_THOMAS_DEWEY_DESC: "Dewey the natural born leader and politician that made it in New York despite his Michigan upbringing. Dewey has continuously proven his assertions correct, including predicting a war in Europe, Asia, and the Americas in the 1930s. His assertions that the New Deal wouldn't be owed entirely to the Republicans was also proven correct. Dewey campaigned under 'Compassionate Capitalism' and tried to distance the reforms from being necessarily welfare. Finally, Dewey's bold prediction that he would win the election came true."
POLITICS_EARL_WARREN_DESC: "Young Earl Warren thought his career was doomed when his father Mathias was blacklisted for joining a strike, but instead it motivated the young man into excelling past this stigma. This prior stigma motivated Earl into joining numerous fraternities and lodges in order to intermingle with the people that stigmatized his father, as well as serving in the military. These connections paid off and sent Earl into a life of public service and eventually reached the Governor seat of California in 1932, where he steered the declining Progressive movement towards the political centre away from the even more declining West Coast Socialist Party. Earl became a progressive entryist within the Republican party, pushing for national desegregation."
POLITICS_CHARLES_MCNARY_DESC: "Charles McNary stood behind the foundation of the Republican party when it was under attack from all angles in 1936. A Progressive at heart but also a pragmatist, McNary was seen within the party as an insurance against the Northwest descending into radicalism, which also made him allies with an ally of Entente interests in North America. In fact, his company provided electricity to a significant portion of Western Canada by the 1940s due to this relationship."
POLITICS_HARRY_TRUMAN_DESC: "Harry Truman's dream of glory in war was dashed when the UC choose to prolong their neutrality during the Weltkrieg. Truman had dropped his college and law degree to prepare himself for the conflict that never came. Continued active service in Central America informed him of the threats of insurgent guerilla warfare. Truman brought this this discipline in the face of chaotic warfare back to Missouri and helped the state as Senator relieve towns that were struck by the chaos of 1936. For this Truman was promoted within the Democratic Party, and supported the New Deal legislation. Most strikingly was his push against the conservatives in favour of military desegregation."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_HARRIMAN_DESC: "Coming from a prominent business family with ties to international trade, William Harriman was able to establish several successful businesses in New York and became an important player in interstate trade. As the federal government has jurisdiction over those transactions, Harriman joined the Department of Commerce. A tactical minded approach to foreign policy and the goal of promoting America's ideology against the radicals that threatened her abroad resonated with Americans and pushed his career upwards."
POLITICS_STROM_THURMOND_DESC: "The decision by Strom to turn the Conservative Manifesto into a raison d’état for the Conservative wing of the Democratic Party was a risky move. Strom had spent decades within the Democratic Party attempting to oppose the overreaching powers of the Federal Government, and ensuring that the party never officially endorse desegregation. This gamble has now paid off as Strom Thurmond has been elected President."
POLITICS_HAPPY_CHANDLER_DESC: "The turning point in Happy Chandler's career came during his intermission in politics to become the Commissioner of Baseball. A term as Governor had established Chandler as a respectable and industrious Democrat with a firm hand on the party line. This stint as Commissioner of Baseball saw a historical decision to allow integrated baseball teams, which led to the end of segregated baseball. This only further elevated Chandler as a Senator and made his decision to carry this support into the Conservative wing of the Democratic Party even more important. His insistence that fiscal conservatism and the race question were not tied together stood against Strom Thurmond's line..."
POLITICS_JOHN_BRICKER_DESC: "An advocate for limited executive power and a non-interventionist interpretation, John Bricker is as old fashioned a Republican as they come. Bricker's career prior to his presidency was that of a rabble raiser and dissenter within the Republican Party railing against suspected socialist sympathizers and opposing the use of executive power to push economic reform. The country as a whole having come close to populist or authoritarian dictatorships just a few years prior."
POLITICS_HAROLD_STASSEN_DESC: "While the senior Republican Party leadership like Willkie and Dewey had preoccupied the 1930s with the minutia of the 1936 crisis, Harold Stassen was serving in the US Navy and being exposed into the wider world. An important lesson learned is the importance of international cooperation as opposed to the tariffs that his fellow Republicans were pushing for. A firm opponent of international syndicalism, Stassen believes that laissez faire economic policies must be replaced by strategic economic cooperation There is no need to hold onto undemocratic institutions such as segregation which only feeds syndicalist arguments."
POLITICS_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_DESC: "A student of warfare in the famous Class of 1915, Eisenhower's initial enthusiasm for testing new military doctrines vanished in Central America, as generals there failed to win against poorly trained insurgencies. While others in this class fell to either the urge for dictatorship or radicalism. Eisenhower stood firm with the Federal government and tried to stay out of civilian politics. Quoted as saying that he wouldn’t want to any politician, from 'dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe' Four years after he made that statement, Eisenhower was being sworn in as President. This came from a national acceptance for the desegregation of the military Eisenhower oversaw."
POLITICS_ADLAI_STEVENSON_DESC: "The reputation of Adlai Stevenson's father, that of an isolationist, dogged Adlai Stevenson II well into his political career. This position among the Democrats was put to the test with the American First Party, which depleted the party rank. Adlai stood to his roots during this most contentious time and persevered. As Governor of Illinois Adlai reformed the police force to be less at odds with socialists and even defended their rights to organize in the face of the Red Scare. Most doubted Adlai's ability to win against the respected General Eisenhower, but through an in kind appreciation from socialist voters Adlai won in the end."
POLITICS_JOHN_SPARKMAN_DESC: "Born in a log cabin and raised on a farm, John Sparkman had a very relatable upbringing. A rapidly ascending legal career and political clubs later and Sparkman had become the Democratic Representative for Huntsville. His victory being especially important in the fateful Year of 36 as he beat the AFP's candidate. Sparkman was instrumental in opening education up to immigrants and women in the South. Silent on social matters and bolstered by his support of science education, Sparkman spoke out against defensive US foreign policy, and eventually left for the Constitution Party, where his reputation put him on the fast track to presidency."
POLITICS_WARREN_HARDING_DESC: "Warren Gamaliel Harding may not have the right profile for the presidency, but that hasn't stopped him from reaching that position.\n\nHarding may seem like a typical Republican at first glance, extolling the virtues of small government and the classic free market economy, but it would be foolish to limit him to that. He first became known in his home state of Ohio for his outspoken rejection of political machines, his generally more progressive views than the average conservative Republican, and his natural charisma, with Harry M. Daugherty, then U.S. Attorney General, even saying of Harding that ‘He looked like a President’. Harding, as a Senator from Ohio, championed opposition to the Socialist Party of America in his home state as socialist ideals advanced greatly in popularity there.\n\nUnfortunately, no one is perfect, and one of Harding's hallmarks is the proliferation of scandals of all kinds, from extramarital affairs to political shenanigans by his allies. Still, Warren's popularity as president is high, and he intends to use the powers of the presidency to ensure the preservation of democracy and of the American Dream."
POLITICS_JAMES_EASTLAND_DESC: "Son of the Mississippi Delta District Attorney, James Eastland was sidetracked from politics for the first three decades in order to run a plantation. An advocate of sharecropping who profited from their work until his plantation quadrupled in size. Eastland stood up in the Senatorial race against the Klan's candidate, and won. Against the Conservative Coalition, Eastman supported the Fair Deal legislation in his home state while voting for it in Congress. As his reputation and passage into the Constitution Party carried much weight, he successfully lead many Democratic voters to his campaign as the closest thing the party could offer to a national candidate."

POLITICS_WARROOM_DESC: ""Gentlemen! You can't fight in here, this is the war room!"\n\nWith the collapse of D.C., a council of generals had to be hastily assembled in order to maintain some semblance of order within the military. However, with constant conflicting directions and a bloated bureaucracy, the military and governance are disorganized and remain ineffecient."

POLITICS_EARL_KEMP_DESC: "Earl Kemp Long, born in 1895, is the younger brother of the late rebel leader Huey Long. Continuing in his brother's footsteps, Earl is a progressive reformer who campaigned in dixie on a ticket of expanded school lunches, public works, and minoritiy rights. Many devotee's of Huey's brother herald him as a true heir that will finish what his brother started. Others however say that Longisim is what lost the the war against the Federals to begin with. Either way, Earl Kemp Long's political future will continue to be defined by the legacy of Huey, unless he can forge his name as a polical force in its own right."
POLITICS_FRANCIS_BLAIR_LEE_III_DESC: "Francis Preston Blair Lee III, born in 1916, was a member of the Lee family, a major historical political family in American history. His father was a major force in Maryland politics, and he is a direct desendant of a founder of the Declaration of Independence. Lee made a name for himself during the Third American Revolution, fighting bravely against the Syndicalists in battles along the Kentucky and Tennessee borders. His administration promises to be somewhat-progressive, but to also fight for 'Dixie Values and Dixie People.' Lee is keeping his family tradition alive."

POLITICS_LOVECRAFT_DESC: "H.P. Lovecraft, born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890, is perhaps one of the most mysterious and controversial figures of the 20th century. His father dying when he was 8, his mother dying of the Spanish Flu in late 1918, and Lovecraft suffering from a plethora of health issues his entire life have led Lovecraft into a search for truth and deep meaning, which he channeled into his writings. Tales of darkness and horror within resonated strongly with an America reeling from the 1925 market crash. Lovecraft's science fiction gained him a serious audience for his thoughts on politics and philosophy. He rapidly gained an almost cult-like status in his home state of Rhode Island and drew many followers, preaching a dark and otherworldly message about supernatural powers and eldritch beings that are incomprehensible to the human mind. As president of the New England Literary Society, Lovecraft standardized the use of the English language in print, removing what he called 'Americanisms'. When he traveled to England in 1924 to study the English language and attempt to purify it as much as possible, he witnessed the 1925 uprising and grew an acute hatred of Syndicalism. He returned to America in 1930, founded his own newspaper and ran unsuccessfully for governor of Rhode Island. He remained a prominent thought leader and a powerful influence on the minds of New Englanders, although his opponents accuse Lovecraft of being a dangerous man with authoritarian and occultist inclinations."
POLITICS_BAXTER_DESC: "Baxter was born into a wealthy family in Portland, Maine where his father James Phinney Baxter served six terms as mayor and had made his fortune in the canning industry. He earned a law degree from Harvard University in 1901. He was a freind to the Canadian government, and a popular governer of Maine, when King Edward VIII decided to put him in charge of the newly created New England Protectorate. He is to protect its people and ensure their loyalty to the crown."

POLITICS_WILD_BILL_DESC: "William Joseph 'Wild Bill' Donovan was born in Buffalo, New York, and studied law at Columbia university. He served under General Pershing in the Mexican campaign and then under General MacArthur as a Colonel in the 42nd division.  During the 2nd American Civil War, Donovan remained loyal to America and fought with distinction against both the Syndicalists and the Longists in their final battles. During the war, Donovan was appointed by MacArthur to America's quasi inteligence service the Black Chamber, who's code breaking resulted in the capture of several important rebel figures. Now, ever loyal Donovan leads the last remnants of America's leadership in their Washington stronghold. God bless the Enclave. God bless America."
POLITICS_MACARTHUR_IV_DESC: "Arthur MacArthur IV, born February 21, 1938, is the only child of Douglas MacArthur and is the rightful heir to our great Caesar. While the boy is obviously too young to properly rule, he has been given the official title as head of state by Loyalists who wish to continue MacArthur's line. As the son of the Great American Unifier, there are high expectations for the young MacArthur. Whether they will be fulfilled remains to be seen."

POLITICS_FORD_DESC: "Henry Ford was born July 30, 1863, on a farm in Greenfield Township, Michigan. An entrepreneur and a business man, his Ford Motor Company was highly successful, bringing the automobile into most people's lives for the first time. By 1936, Ford had built such a power base that the syndicalist uprising failed to kill him or significantly damage his business, and much of Ford's equipment would help General MacArthur. After the American Collapse, Ford and his company seized power over the Great Lakes, where his powerbase was concentrated. Now, Henry Ford is the absolute ruler of a great portion of America, and his company has complete ownership of the old Syndicalist heartland."

POLITICS_CHARLES_CURTIS_DESC: "The Vice President of the Hoover administration, Curtis is the voice of compromise and reform in the American government. The first President of Native American ancestry, he serves as an effective rallying point for racial justice and brings an affable face and new commitment to American values of liberty and freedom for all men, although many wonder if he can settle the coming conflict."
POLITICS_BIG_BILL_HAYWOOD_DESC: "If there ever was a man to represent the power of the working class, it would be William Haywood. Haywood has seen all corners of the country and lived alongside the working man. Haywood opposed Craft Unionism, which he felt could be divided and conquered by Capital. Instead founding one union, the International Workers of the World, meant to represent all working interests.  As the founder of the IWW, 'Big Bill' has battled the enemies of the people throughout his life: The capitalist opportunists, the labor slavehandlers, and even agents of the government. Quick to anger and unafraid of action, Haywood is the Man for Labor and the Man for America."

POLITICS_INNSMOUTH_DESC: "Charles Dern is a progressive businessman and the former head of the America First Party in Utah. Born in 1872 in Nebraska, Dern settled in Utah to found a successful ironworks company. After becoming disillusioned with the Democratic Party, Dern took inspiration from the reformist policies of Louisiana's Huey Long, eventually joining the America First Party. Dern ran unsuccessfully on a progressive platform for governor and broke all ties with the AFP after the American Union State rose into full rebellion. During the Civil War, Dern supported the legitimate government, and after the Collapse ran on a platform of peace and welfare. Tired and war-weary, the people of Utah have voted in Dern to implement his progressive reforms and lead Utah down a kinder, gentler road."
POLITICS_THEREWILLBEBLOOD_DESC: "Henry Hooper Blood was born October 1st 1872, in Kaysville, Utah Territory. A prominent businessman, he successfully ran for governor of the state of Utah in 1933. A key civilian figure within the MacArthur regime, Blood has managed to bring his state beyond the quasi-independent status it enjoyed before 1857. Only time will tell whether this fledgling nation's independence will be more secure than the last."
POLITICS_EZRABENSON_DESC: "Benson was born into a Mormon family in 1899 on a farm in Whitney, Idaho, and would be called to become a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles in 1939. After getting special permission, he was allowed to serve as both an a apostle and a member of the cabinet, where he served as Secretary of Agriculture for the wartime administration. During his tenure he was fiercely in opposition to redistributionism and government aid, viewing it as immoral theft. After the Great American Collapse, he promised the people of Deseret a nonintrusive, minimalist government. The war-weary populace readily agreed and elected him. Now Benson's vison of maximum liberty will play out across the nation of Deseret, perhaps for a long time to come."
POLITICS_ROMNEY_DESC: "George W Romney, born 1907 in the Mormon Colonies in Mexico, is a successful Mormon businessman and an anti-syndicalist political pundit. Having witnessed Syndicalist revolutions in both Britain and Mexico, where Romney had been a missionary, Romney developed a great aversion to Syndicalist ideology. During the 2nd American Civil War, Romney served as Acting Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for the federal government, and had traveled the Federal controlled territories speaking about the dangers of Syndicalism and stirring up support for the war. Now he has been appointed to the leadership of an independent Deseret, and his anti-syndicalist vision will safely guide them into the future."
POLITICS_HEBER_DESC: "Heber Grant, born 1865 in Salt Lake City, Utah, is the president of the Church of Latter Day Saints, commonly known as the Mormon Church. An apostle, Grant was called in 1918, after the death of Joseph F. Smith, to serve as the leader of the Mormon Church. As leader, he led an agenda of strict Prohibition, banned plural marriages, and reconciled relations with the US Government. During the 2nd American Civil War, he urged Mormons to support the Federal government, seeing it as the best hope for a orderly and moral society in America. After the Great American Collapse, the LDS Church, with Grant at its head, has taken the reigns and re-established the nation of Deseret as an independent Mormon nation. Once again the Mormons rely on their faith in God to lead them towards a better tomorrow."
POLITICS_REUBENCLARK_DESC: "J. Reuben Clark was born in Grantsville, Utah Territory, on September 1st 1871. First a employee of the State Department, and then returning to Utah to serve as Second Counselor to the First President. In October 1934, Clark was ordained an apostle and member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. During the ACW he proposed several reforms which centralized and expanded the Church Of Latter Day Saints' business operations. After the Great American Collapse, Clark and Grant would lead opposing factions within the Church. After a long and tumultuous powerstruggle, Clark secured his power and led the Church in taking over the state of Deseret and restoring order. Now his hand will guide it to the future."

USA_righteous_nation: "The Rightful President"
USA_righteous_nation_desc: "In light of the recent electoral deadlock, former President Herbert Hoover has given Douglas MacArthur his permission to succeed him as president of the United States and Commander in Chief. This was a painful decision for Hoover, but one that he felt needed to be done to end the crisis. Consequently, the new administration has gained legitimacy in the eyes of many of our citizens, and MacArthur is seen as the rightful winner of the election. With the support of most of Hoover's cabinet and Hoover himself, we are one step closer to bringing order to this fractured nation!"

Normally the Northern Democrats have been able to make them heel outside of the South, but with the economy collapsed it seems that the Klan is no longer content to keep it's Southern Way of Life in the South. From Indiana to Washington State, the Klan has been slowly poisoning the well of Freedom Loving Americans with lynching after lynching.

###Pre-War ###
USA_garner_wins: "Cactus Jack"
USA_garner_wins_desc: "The Traditional Democrats have come to power under John Nance Garner with their promise of stabilizing the American Republic while opposing the Radicals demands which would change the United States forever. It is time to defend the constitution and liberty at all costs!"
USA_Garner_free_trade: "Sweep away Farm Tariffs"
USA_Garner_free_trade_desc: "Farmers have long leaned Democratic, largely in opposition to the Republican policy of supporting protectionism which made it more difficult to export their own goods. While many of them have drifted to the AFP, Progressives, Old Democrats and even Socialists, undoing Hoover's Tariff policy will undercut the radicals while aiding farmers."
USA_rural_investments: "Rural Investments"
USA_rural_investments_desc: "While generally opposed to high-levels of government intervention in the economy, supporting the rural economy is a no-brainer. The government will purchase goods from struggling farmers and grant state funding that will be used to support developing rural regions via the introduction or modernization of electricity."
USA_austerity: "Austerity Through the Storm"
USA_austerity_desc: "We have made the necessary investments to damage support for the radicals amongst the backbone of our democracy: the farmers and sharecroppers. However, now we must cut back on the budget and show businesses that this is a fiscally responsible nation they can invest in if we are to avoid both a debt that radicals can use against us and aid the economic recovery throughout the nation. But what to slash..."
USA_smash_radicals: "Smash Radicals"
USA_smash_radicals_desc: "We will not give into those who threaten to subvert American democracy for their own interests! MacArthur has offered to stomp them out if given the chance, and we will allow him to organize his military and gather intel for the mission. The only question is whom to focus on and how much so."
USA_undermine_old_democrats: "Undermine the Populists"
USA_undermine_old_democrats_desc: "We will not allow Populist factions to continue to undermine the Democratic Party! We will campaign throughout the regions where they are most popular, spread counter-propaganda, and promise tax cuts whenever possible. Of course we should decide which faction deserves our attention most, if not all of them."
USA_hoovers_boys: "The Director's Boys"
USA_hoovers_boys_desc: "J. Edgar Hoover is both the ruthless head of the recently formed Federal Bureau of Investigation and an invaluable asset against the militias and fanatics endangering liberty in the United States. He has offered numerous times to further investigate dangerous extremists if given the resources and direction."
USA_reassert_democrats: "Reassert the Democratic Party"
USA_reassert_democrats_desc: "The Democratic Party had suffered much from the rise of the numerous third parties attempting to steal its voterbase. However, the US can only be stable under a two-party system. We will use our re-established presence to bring old supporters back into the traditional Democratic mold, hopefully finishing off the AFP and Old Democrats from national importance."
USA_army_expansion: "MacArthur's Request"
USA_army_expansion_desc: "MacArthur seems to be effectively waging war against the radicals but has been desperately calling for additional aid, seemingly taking the governments lack of willingness to expand the military as a sign of weakness. Perhaps he does need some extra hands on deck, if he hopes to maintain order."
USA_finish_anarchists: "Finish Anarchism"
USA_finish_anarchists_desc: "The syndicalist cause has been greatly weakened and momentarily unable to raise a large enough militia to challenge the US army. Nonetheless, it remains a threat, as if a snake waiting for their chance to strike."
USA_yay_liquor: "A Blow for Liberty"
USA_yay_liquor_desc: "There have been increasingly loud calls for prohibition in recent years, and in fact, many states and smaller districts have enacted dry laws to damage the liquor business. However, the state needs funding and the right to alcohol is a fundamental freedom. Let us guide a reinvigorated Democratic Party towards wet laws that will make a mockery of the pro-prohibition authoritarians and bring in a new valuable source of income and business."
USA_sovereignity_of_legislature: "Sovereignty of the Legislature"
USA_sovereignity_of_legislature_desc: "Enough! America has been saved from the radicals and it is now time for Garner to set a precedent of divorcing the executive and legislative branches from one another. Many of the executive powers Wilson gave to the Presidency, including using government power to shape public opinion and investigating lawmakers, will be revoked. A hands off approach shall be taken to both Congress and the Democratic Party."
USA_the_republicans: "The Center Holds"
USA_the_republicans_desc: "Against all odds the Republican Party has won re-election! We must follow through on our promise to save America through the Home Rule Plan before the radicals drag down the entire nation!"
USA_new_republicans: "New Republicans"
USA_new_republicans_desc: "Capitalism obviously should be defended from those who would install more tyrannical and short-sighted systems but that does not mean the government could not be doing more than it is now to fight the depression. The New Republicans under Landon will help guide America with both free markets and help to those who need it most."
USA_home_rule_negotiations: "Home Rule Negotiations"
USA_home_rule_negotiations_desc: "America will not be saved with the iron fist but instead with that which has always served America best; freedom. If the people that make up the various radical sectors of America want to run their local governments differently so be it, but that does not mean they can leave America or violate the Constitution. Allow us to start the talks for a reasonable amount of autonomy."
USA_calm_the_storm: "Calm the Storm"
USA_calm_the_storm_desc: "We must reassure the nation that violent outbursts are not to be tolerated. We must direct the party to speak of the peace achieved and that only those practice their views through violence will be targeted by the federal government. In the meantime we can calm all sides by telling the military to move garrisons from border regions of radical territory as we were previously prepared for potential conflict."
USA_counter_klan: "Counter the Klan"
USA_counter_klan_desc: "The question of how to deal with the Klan is a complicated one. Much of Congress is in cahoots with the National Democratic White League, and they command enough power to cause major damage to the US if they desired. However, if we are to deal with it bloodlessly, we should embrace the more moderate members of the organization and encourage them to leave the Klan and NDWL in favor of smaller, more controllable groups. We won't get the hardliners to leave, but if we can sap most of their support, the effort will be a success."
USA_moderate_the_unions: "Reward Moderate Unions"
USA_moderate_the_unions_desc: "Destroying the Unions is an incredibly touchy subject, and one that rarely results in anyone winning. However, there is still a chance we can Bust the Unions and still come out on top, the SPA doesn't have a complete monopoly yet on Labor, there are still some, although small, Unions have have our sympathies, if we reward these Unions, and have them actively go against the radical ones, we just might be able to save America from the Syndicalist Terror, though that possibility looks more and more slim by the hour..."
USA_reassure_business: "Reassure Business"
USA_reassure_business_desc: "With the country seemingly ready to collapse at any day now, Big Business is more terrified then ever. We cannot let our great American businesses fail us, we must reassure them that we're going to fix this crisis and bring back America to the economic level she naturally should be at. Because after all, if confidence collapses, then the depression we're in will go on far longer, and the Radicals will grow even stronger."
USA_hunt_waste: "Hunt Waste"
USA_hunt_waste_desc: "In order to keep some semblace of Confidence in the Economy, we have to begin to institute austerity. It won't be all popular, but hopefully the new confidence will get Big Business investing again, and this crisis can finally end."
USA_return_to_normalcy: "A Return to Normalcy"
USA_return_to_normalcy_desc: "Against all odds, our plan has worked. Investment is steadily increasing, Strikes are becoming more and more rare, and the KKK have been pushed back into the South. The odds were against us, but we did it. We have returned to normalcy."
USA_curtis_in_charge: "The Old Guard"
USA_curtis_in_charge_desc: "While we are not Socialists, we agree that it's foolhardy to think that this crisis is going to suddenly evaporate just because we increased confidence. We knew that in 1789 we knew it in 1860, we knew it in 1896, and we know it now. Now, the government must do what it can to reward hard working Americans, just like we did in the past, whether that'd be unemployment or through tariffs."
USA_work_sharing_plan: "Work Sharing Plan"
USA_work_sharing_plan_desc: "One of the most ingenious ideas our economists have thought up, the Work Sharing Plan, might just be enough to save our nation. We compensate Americans for their hours lost via partial unemployment subsidies, and buisnesses to retrain them for when the crisis is over and they can get back to work! Thanks to to this ingenious idea, we can keep the amount spent to a minimum, and keep our populace happy!"
USA_new_tariffs: "New Tariffs"
USA_new_tariffs_desc: "The Republican Party has always been a protectionist party. Tariffs increase revenue for the Federal Government, protect our workers and employers from cheap foreign goods, and can be used as leverage in foreign policy. With the economy needing some new revenue for our Work Sharing Plan, tariffs serve as a natural policy, just as it did in our past economic crisises."
USA_good_times: "Good Times Are Just Around the Corner"
USA_good_times_desc: "Thanks to our careful balancing between intervention and free market, our economy is finally looking to be out of this crisis! It was hard, but thanks to our tried and true ways, America is finally back on her feet and set to make a full recovery! Good times will be coming round soon!"
USA_peace_through_trade: "Peace through Trade"
USA_peace_through_trade_desc: "While we have been protectionist in the past, it's time to let old policies go. Tariffs only serve to estrange our trade partners and further increase costs for the average American, as well as increase the already bloated power of the all encompassing Federal Government. Thus, by increasing cooperation with our allies, we can finally end the idiotic policy of Tariffs."
USA_landon_plan: "The Landon Plan"
USA_landon_plan_desc: "While we must stand firmly by capitalism, it is clear the economy is not going to recover on its own in short order without some government intervention. We should issue some investments and remove trade barriers to increase consumption and increase market confidence."
USA_i_will_not_promise: "I Will Not Promise the Moon"
USA_i_will_not_promise_desc: "We have gone far in recent days, freeing the economy from the shackles of the depression and providing goods for the people. But we must reassure the public, and investors, that we will not go too far, and balance the budget by cutting back when possible in our projects after negotiating with private sector leaders to take over. The economy shall grow and the US government will be seen as solvent and honest."
USA_unite_federal_americans: "Unite Federal Americans"
USA_unite_federal_americans_desc: "We have done it! We can now focus on chipping away at the support bases of the radicals more openly without political and economic stability fueling them. A propaganda and educational campaign will raise awareness of the federal government's recent actions, our national political identity and the threats posed by those who desire revolution."
USA_norris: "The Fighting Liberal"
USA_norris_desc: "Despite the odds, President Norris has been elected, and now serves as the 31st President of the USA. One of the few Progressives left in America, Norris has won on a platform of the Square Deal, saving the American Public from war, and finally living up to the goals of American Democracy. This is true for all Americans, no matter their creed. There is much to do, and the odds are slim, but Norris will save America."
USA_progressive_collaboration: "Progressive Collaboration"
USA_progressive_collaboration_desc: "The Progressives have long been outspoken allies of our cause, from Roosevelt to Mr. Floyd, the Progressives have always been great supporters of Democracy and the American Dream, and are the fiercest opponents of the Ku Klux Klan by far. It is only natural that we do our best to ally ourselves with them."
USA_emergency_intervention: "Emergency Intervention"
USA_emergency_intervention_desc: "This is not the time for doing what we can to help out the well off. Investment will always be a slow process, too slow. That's why we need to intervene now and make sure that every American is fed, clothed, and sheltered. Because if there's one thing that's worse than the economic crisis, it's the possibility of Radicals militantly putting the population into war."
USA_mcnary_plan: "McNary Plan"
USA_mcnary_plan_desc: "Republican Senator Charles McNary has a plan to help our farmers. We will implement higher domestic prices for farm products in order to help our farmers get back on their feet. The government will purchase some of these in order to assist them further. This will let farmers get back to work and some of their family members will be available for other projects."
USA_muscle_shoal_plan: "Muscle Shoal Plan"
USA_muscle_shoal_plan_desc: "The Tennessee River has previously served very little purpose for the United States. With President Norris's goal of Electrification taking great precedent over these past few months, a few of our engineers think that Muscle Shoals on the Tennessee would make it an idylic place for a Hydroelectric Dam! This would obviously serve as a great boon, not only for the engineering benefits, but also for electrification!"
USA_war_on_unemployment: "Mass Unemployment Relief"
USA_war_on_unemployment_desc: "Our people need to be able to live. To not support the hardest working people in our nation is suicide. Thus, President Norris will institute the biggest unemployment fund ever seen on the Western Hemisphere, so that we may get out of this crisis and into a brighter future!"
USA_war_on_the_klan: "Strike the White Leagues"
USA_war_on_the_klan_desc: "There is one group that has such notoriety that its mere mention can turn a room silent: The Ku Klux Klan. The KKK is by far the most dangerous terrorist group facing our shores in this massive crisis; their weekly political assassinations and voter suppression and intimidation efforts are unmatched. That is why we must attack them at their source. The President will declare that the various white leagues across the nation will be disbanded at once."
USA_southern_investments: "Southern Investments"
USA_southern_investments_desc: "Now that we've struck the worst of the bunch, it's time to move on to the average man. Before the KKK inevitably reforms, we have to convince the South that we are not the enemy; by increasing their quality of life, we might just be able to do that. Taking into account the socioeconomic reality that the South is the poorest region of the USA, perhaps by giving them special investment priority, they'll see that we're not the enemy."
USA_radical_republican_constiuency: "Revive a Radical Republican Constituency"
USA_radical_republican_constiuency_desc: "The Radical Republicans, America's forgotten Progressives. Ever since that fateful November in 1876, the once mightiest party faction in the RNC and even the nation has been nothing but a memory. That is, until we came along. It is time to revive this relic for the modern day, to remind all Americans that we're not radicals like the SPA or the AFP, but merely a rebirth of what was once the most powerful faction in America."
USA_jeffersonian_agrarianism: "Jeffersonian Agrarianism"
USA_jeffersonian_agrarianism_desc: "The South still sees us as Carpetbaggers seeking to replace their Agrarian way of life with some vauge notion of an Urbanist hell hole; they couldn't be further from the truth. We don't seek to uproot Agrarianism, just the opposite: we are the descendants of Jefferson when it comes to agriculture, and with our policies the South will turn into a paradise!"
USA_square_deal: "The Square Deal"
USA_square_deal_desc: "About 30 year ago, Teddy Roosevelt was President, and he had a dream. A dream of a square, fair deal. A dream that all Americans would be taken care of, not because of some Paternalistic idea of State Loyalty, but because it was simply the right thing to do. His successors failed at this, and it's up to us to finish it."
USA_infrastrucure_for_the_future: "Infrastructure for the Future"
USA_infrastrucure_for_the_future_desc: "We're not thinking far ahead enough. In 30 some odd years, our new roads are going to be worthless! We need to plan ahead for the future, so that even if all else fails, Americans will still be able to rely on good, solid, infrastructure."
USA_dreams_of_henry_george: "Dreams of Henry George"
USA_dreams_of_henry_george_desc: "Henry George was a notable figure in the Progressive Era. His advocacy of a single tax on land, in which property taxes would be the only taxes people would pay, is very popular with our party, and our constituents. Let us embrace this idea, brought to us by Henry George, Thomas Paine, and John Locke. Towards a more prosperous future!"
USA_forresty_for_america: "Forestry for America"
USA_forresty_for_america_desc: "America was once not known for her massive Industry, but for her trees. Most people can remember the massive lumber mills that once populated every small town in the Northern United States. However, what is seldom talked about is the environmental aspect of the massive Lumber Industry. The once massive woodlands are slowly turning into depopulated swamps with the loss of the trees, and we cannot allow this to happen further"
USA_a_popular_vote: "A Popular Vote"
USA_a_popular_vote_desc: "The Electoral College, quite frankly, is anti democratic. There have been three elections where our supposed representatives have voted against the will of the people. In order to preserve democracy, we must get rid of this old system, and replace it with a modern, democratic, popular election."
USA_the_greatest_evil: "The Greatest Evil"
USA_the_greatest_evil_desc: "Alcohol is a disease that poisons the mind, body, and soul. It turns men into vicious, vindictive demons. This must end. It is time to end this plague upon our nation, and liberate ourselves to finally be free. It is time to break the bottle."
USA_fight_the_debt: "Fighting Our Debt"
USA_fight_the_debt_desc: "We have engaged in significant deficit spending to get out of this economic crisis. While this hasn't necessarily harmed us yet, many of our politicians are urging us to make sure our debt does not become unmanageable. We should take measures to cut our debt, perhaps raising taxes on the wealthy would do the trick. They can handle it..."
USA_model_legislature: "A Model Legislature"
USA_model_legislature_desc: "We have restored American government to its past glory. Now, our legislature will be a shining example for the world to see, and our twinkling social democracy should inspire democratic governments the world over. It truly will be our century."
USA_fight_crime: "Build Housing"
USA_fight_crime_desc: "If the poor are going to have an opportunity to live well, then we must build additional housing for them to seek respite and to help further develop the nation."

### Navy With A State ###
USA_navy_in_command: "The Navy in Command"
USA_navy_in_command_desc: "After months of tension between the Navy and MacArthur, largely stemming from MacArthur's attempts to impose his will on the Navy and a perception that MacArthur's actions are endangering the war effort, the U.S. Navy has taken control of the government. Though they have apparently done so with the support of Congress and the Western Command Center, the alliance is a fragile one, and what will happen next is unknown..."
USA_admiral_leahy: "Admiral Leahy"
USA_admiral_leahy_desc: "William D. Leahy, nicknamed "the Judge" by his peers, has seized the reins of the country from Douglas MacArthur and now hopes to turn the nation on a path towards democracy once more. Blaming MacArthur for beginning the war, he also hopes to negotiate with the Western factions to help mend the damage done to the country and hopefully save America."
USA_pacific_reconciliation: "Pacific Reconciliation"
USA_pacific_reconciliation_desc: "The loss of the Pacific Coast and all its resources was devastating for the war effort. If we are to mend the damage that MacArthur has done, we must reach out to the Pacific government and come to an agreement regarding the end of the war."
USA_naval_investments: "Naval Investments"
USA_naval_investments_desc: "It is the belief of Admiral Leahy that significant naval investment is necessary for a successful war effort. As seen in the First Civil War, the U.S. Navy can have a devastating impact on the ability of the enemy to continue fighting, and though MacArthur neglected this fact, we will not."
USA_court_the_rockies: "Court the Rockies"
USA_court_the_rockies_desc: "Though Douglas MacArthur was untrustworthy, his counterparts in the West are dedicated to American democracy. They have expressed a willingness to cooperate in any way necessary to restore the liberties we once cherished as citizens of this ravaged country. To further reassure these men, we must meet with Eisenhower and Bradley and prove to them that we will serve the United States, not our own interests."
USA_supreme_court_trial: "Supreme Court Trial"
USA_supreme_court_trial_desc: "With MacArthur and the men who hepled him coup the government in our hands, their fate must now be decided. However, given the nature of his involvement in politics, Congress has insisted that he be given to the Supreme Court rather than a court martial to decide his fate. Their decision looms large over our administration and the country at large..."
USA_decision_of_congress: "Decision of Congress"
USA_decision_of_congress_desc: "Though Leahy has taken the reins of government from MacArthur, he is reluctant to remain in this position. Instead, we have left the decision of how we proceed with restoring democracy to Congress. We can only hope that they make the right decision for the country."
USA_savior_of_democracy: "The Savior of Democracy"
USA_savior_of_democracy_desc: "Though there is much work to be done, the situation within our own borders has stabilized. The U.S. Navy has saved democracy, and though we cannot end the Civil War so easily, we now have a righteous cause that will unify all true Americans to us!"
USA_admiral_king: "Admiral King"
USA_admiral_king_desc: "Admiral Ernest King tolerated MacArthur's insulting treatment of the U.S. Navy for months, but when MacArthur threatened to take direct control over the Navy, it became too much to handle. King did what he had to do-not just for the Navy, but for the country. Now that he is in charge though, we must focus on winning the war."
USA_the_blank_check: "The Blank Check"
USA_the_blank_check_desc: "Douglas MacArthur neglected industry during his brief time in power, whether it was concerned with the navy or otherwise. This state of affairs cannot continue. We must put the limited resources we possess to work producing vehicles, ships, and equipment for our military. To do so, King has announced a "Blank Check" for the econonmy; that is, an investment of however much money is necessary to win the war, regardless of its later reprecussions."
USA_protection_for_payment: "Protection for Payment"
USA_protection_for_payment_desc: "We cannot fund our growing navy without the resources to do so. To help us in this effort, Admiral King plans to offer U.S. Navy protection in exchange for various resources or other forms of financial compensation. Of course, if these regions fail to pay their due, we will act accordingly to ensure they have all the protection they will ever need, and of course, that we have everything we need too."
USA_congressional_subordination: "Congressional Subordination"
USA_congressional_subordination_desc: "Though Congress supported our efforts to oust MacArthur, they are now nothing more than a nuisance. We must bring them to heel if we want to avoid the same fate as MacArthur, a fate that King does not intend to share. The only question that remains is how to proceed with this act..."
USA_secure_the_coastline: "Secure the Coastline"
USA_secure_the_coastline_desc: "Significant parts of our population, industry, and resources lie on or near the coast. Securing our own coastline is essential to guarding our territory, and securing the coastlines of our rivals will bring us one step closer to victory. The ability to blockade and starve the enemy cannot be underestimated, and as such, we will gain control over these areas at once."
USA_navy_first: "Navy First"
USA_navy_first_desc: "Though it has been neglected in recent years, Admiral King believes that it is never too late to shift resources towards the Navy. Through this investment, we will force our enemies in the Civil War into submission, and when that is done, perhaps we will have the strength to defend ourselves against other global powers as well. It is time the Navy had its due!"
USA_admiral_of_navy: "The Fleet Admiral"
USA_admiral_of_navy_desc: "It is time that Ernest King took on a title worthy of his position at the head of the American war effort. As some of his men have already referred to him as "Fleet Admiral", he has decided to adopt this as his title. Now the world will see what such a man can do when in total control over his nation..."
USA_american_dockyards: "American Dockyards"
USA_american_dockyards_desc: "It is time that America surpassed the likes of Germany, Britain, Japan, and Canada, in her naval capacities. We have the potential to build the largest navy the world has ever seen, and yet we have not. By building up our naval industry, we will be one step closer to achieving this aim."
USA_the_canal_we_built: "The Canal We Built"
USA_the_canal_we_built_desc: "The key to naval dominance in the Americas lies not only in the amount of ships we have, but also in our control over the Panama Control. However, our influence in this region has been threatened as of late, and given that we built the canal, it is only fair that we maintain our control over it. Let us move to secure it before another country can stop us."
USA_ports_of_the_atlantic: "Ports of the Atlantic"
USA_ports_of_the_atlantic_desc: "That we are surrounded on all sides by Englishmen and their lackeys is a fact that has been duly noted in King's administration, and it is a state of affairs we cannot allow. The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans protect us, but they will only do so if they are firmly under our control. We must move at once to guarantee that it is America, not the Entente, that controls the Atlantic."
USA_the_beautiful_pacific: "The Beautiful Pacific"
USA_the_beautiful_pacific_desc: "The Pacific Ocean is a vast region, but it is one that we have dominated-at least until recently. Now, Japan, Germany, and the Entente alike threaten our interests there. King insists that our control over the Pacific territories is vital to any attempt to become a superpower in our own right. With our newfound naval strength, it should pose no risk to us..."
USA_end_the_anglo_empire: "End the Anglo Empire"
USA_end_the_anglo_empire_desc: "For too long, the British Navy has loomed large over the world, lording over its imperial possessions and now directly interfering in our affairs. Though King is no fan of syndicalists, the Canadian move to seize New England was a blatant denial of American sovereignty. Now we will teach these overmighty Brits a lesson."

###Post Civil War - Liberal Presidency ###

USA_mac_victory: "Victory in the Civil War"
USA_mac_victory_desc: "Separatists have again failed in their mission to destroy the union of the United States of America. Though both radical socialists and populists dug into our power base, we have proven the power of legitimate government once more. The would-be dictators Haywood and Long are no longer welcome in America, nor are the Southern traitors that fought under Murray. "
USA_constitutional_convention: "Victory in the Civil War"
USA_constitutional_convention_desc: "Separatists have again failed in their mission to destroy the union of the United States of America. Though both radical socialists and populists dug into out power base, we have proven the power of legitimate government once more. The would-be dictators Haywood and Long are no longer welcome in America."
USA_SPQA: "Senatus Populusque Americanus"
USA_SPQA_desc: "MacArthur, the quintessential tyrannical executive, has been pressured into stepping down in what is a victory for the legislative branch and for republicanism as a whole. We shall return to an older time in America, when Congress ruled the land, and presidents were too weak to impose their will upon the American people, as the British kings once did. Candidates for the major parties will be chosen from Congress to seek the presidency, and we shall enter a new era in our republic."  
USA_congressional_authority: "Congressional Authority"
USA_congressional_authority_desc: "Though our country has three equal branches of government, the executive branch has gained more and more power since the days of Abraham Lincoln. Perhaps it is best that an executive have power during a war; the Romans certainly thought so. However, we cannot allow America to slip into dictatorship, as they did, and Congress shall exercise its authority against any would-be tyrant, in any way it can."
USA_new_amendments: "New Amendments"
USA_new_amendments_desc: "The cries of our people have not fallen on deaf ears. The Civil War would have never occurred were it not for political malfeasance throughout our government. It is time our constitution was updated, and as such, we shall pass new amendments addressing some of the concerns levied against big businesses as well as against the rebellious immigrants they hired."
USA_congress_restored: "Full Congressional Restoration"
USA_congress_restored_desc: "Congress has been fully restored to its old glory. Those who stepped down in recent times out of intimidation are returning, and new blood is coming to Washington as well. Gone are the extremist parties that tore the nation apart, and they are replaced by revitalized Democratic and Republican parties that work to represent all. Americans can safely write to their congressmen once more, and democracy is saved."
USA_classical_liberal_mandate: "The American Cincinnatus"
USA_classical_liberal_mandate_desc: "Though the temptation towards autocracy was great, America stood with its three branches intact, without giving up to executive authority. Congress is called into emergency session and the Appellate Courts are dealing with their mountain of paper trying to sort out the consequences. For his part, MacArthur is seen as a hero who did his duty to the country and stepped down when he was no longer needed."
USA_democratic_education: "Constitutional Education"
USA_democratic_education_desc: "A common talking point by radicals and populists was the idea that the Federal Government is a voluntary organization. Some even claim to use ridiculous false loopholes like naval law or the rights to secede from the union. We must correct this by making the U.S Constitution as widely available as possible."
USA_review_the_fed: "Review the Fed"
USA_review_the_fed_desc: "One of the things we must do to recover from the recent turmoil is to review the Federal Reserve. Some argue that we should privatize it, saying that it would be more efficient this way. Others want to fully abolish it, saying it is an institution that is not necessary to solve financial crises. There are also those who wish to reform it and make it a better institution. Regardless, we must make a decision regarding it." 
USA_bill_of_rights: "Bill of Rights Reminder"
USA_bill_of_rights_desc: "Building off of a Constitutional education initiative, Congress has approved of an education push to younger Americans on the importance of our Bill of Rights. This will also allow citizens to better appeal for their rights in a non-violent manner."
USA_american_values1: "American Values"
USA_american_values1_desc: "The passive promotion of civil government through high minded publications was undercut sharply by pamphlets and private publishers that promoted an uncivil government. Congress has decided that a multifaceted approach to instilling American values through mass media will finally undercut pamphleteers."

USA_malice_and_charity: "Malice and Charity"
USA_malice_and_charity_desc: "With the words of president Lincoln reminding us to 'bind the nation's wounds', Congress has created a system to reintegrate the rebel states on a massive scale. Through a non-partisan Committee called 'Malice and Charity', districts can be re-added to the Union."

USA_victory_in_the_civil_war: "Victory in the Civil War"
USA_victory_in_the_civil_war_desc: "Separatists have again failed in their mission to destroy the union of the United States of America. Though both radical socialists and populists dug into out power base, we have proven the power of legitimate government once more. The would-be dictators Haywood and Long are no longer welcome in America."
USA_finish_spa: "Destroy Radicalism"
USA_finish_spa_desc: "While the US Government tolerates political discourse, Congress has rallied against the syndicalist and distributionist platforms of Long and Haywood. Legal bodies found to be advocating for trade unions or mutualist organizations will be prosecuted under the 1917 Sedition Act."

USA_fight_the_poll_tax: "The Freedman's Bureau"
USA_fight_the_poll_tax_desc: "After the First Civil War, we established a Freedmen's Bureau to help African Americans join the larger society. With the Second Civil War over, we must do this again, but go farther. We will promote Black politicians and allow Black people the right to vote, and make sure they have what they need to keep the Klan down."
USA_redeemer_collaboration: "Redeemer Collaboration"
USA_redeemer_collaboration_desc: "There are some members of the ODP and the Klan that our politicians insist we try to rehabilitate, likely due to the fact many of them were Democrats once. We will seek out the least radical and rabid among them and bring them back into the fold. In exchange, they will help us hunt down remaining Klan members. This may be unpopular with our Black citizens, yet it is necessary to restore order."

USA_maintain_nationalizations: "Maintain Federal Controls"
USA_maintain_nationalizations_desc: "Though we disagree with much of what the SPA stood for, some of our authoritarian-leaning left wing politicians are insisting that the TUUL and Centralist factions, who wanted industry nationalization, were correct. These representatives are pushing us to maintain our own federal controls of industry, so that we can clamp down on corporate greed."
USA_local_control: "Local Industrialism"
USA_local_control_desc: "Many of our Social Democrats who are sympathetic to Syndicalist views have argued that we should implement a system of "Local Industrialism". This would entail higher worker control over their workplace in addition to other reforms including guaranteed union rights for workers, as long as they belong to a loyal union..." 
USA_defend_democracy: "Freedman's Bureau"
USA_defend_democracy_desc: "Out of the former rebel states, reports have come in of voter intimidation based on class and race. Candidates running for office without an oath of allegiance to the United States. We must protect the peoples' right to vote, and politicians do not incite rebellion again."
USA_bill_of_rights: "Bill of Rights Reminder"
USA_bill_of_rights_desc: "Building off of a Constitutional education initiative, Congress has approved of an education push to younger Americans on the importance of our Bill of Rights. This will also allow citizens to better appeal for their rights in a non-violent manner."
USA_end_jim_crow: "End Jim Crow"
USA_end_jim_crow_desc: "Abraham Lincoln is rolling in his grave today, partly thanks to the Jim Crow system in the South. The system is slavery in all but name, and if we are to restore liberal democracy, we must end this system. This may be unpopular with more racist Southerners, but we will not make the mistake of coddling them again."
USA_traditional_machines: "Traditional Machines"
USA_traditional_machines_desc: "The Democratic Party has dominated the South for decades. In most of the region, the Republican Party doesn't even have any infrastructure. Why tear down already established political machines if they can become more moderate? We will work with these machines to make sure we can fully control the South."
USA_trial_of_the_federalists: "Trial of the Federalists"
USA_trial_of_the_federalists_desc: "MacArthur betrayed the constitution when he forced his way into power in Washington. We must decide the fate of his followers. Some of our politicians and military officials argue that these men saved this country, and their opponents insist with equal energy that we hang every one of them. Their fate will be decided in the courts, as was the fate of criminals before the Second Civil War."
USA_loyal_army: "Loyalist Army"
USA_loyal_army_desc: "Though men like MacArthur overstepped their boundaries, punishing them too harshly would be seen as distasteful by many of our people. Those who have sympathy for these men argue that they were ultimately loyal to America and to democracy. We have an army that is loyal to us, and that is what matters."
USA_hit_radical_redshirts: "Crush the Old Klan"
USA_hit_radical_redshirts_desc: "The Old Ku Klux Klan is a leftover from the First Civil War. Almost eighty years later, it is finally time for them to die. We will squash the Black Legion and the Klan and make sure neither has the power to rise up against us ever again."
USA_salute_the_patriots: "Salute the Patriots"
USA_salute_the_patriots_desc: "MacArthur and his men have preserved the constitution, and have shown great restraint in doing so. In deciding to allow American democracy to continue, they are a model for how militaries around the world should treat their governments. Let us salute our patriotic military!"
USA_american_values1: "American Values"
USA_american_values1_desc: "The passive promotion of civil government through high minded publications was undercut sharply by pamphlets and private publishers that promoted an uncivil government. Congress has decided that a multifaceted approach to instilling American values through mass media will finally undercut pamphleteers."

USA_strengthen_democracy: "Strengthen Democracy"
USA_strengthen_democracy_desc: "During the civil war, democratic processes were halted at the local level. Many elections in the border areas were skipped in order to focus more time on the existential crisis of the war for America. Democracy shall now rise from the ashes, and Congress has appointed a committee to ensure elections take place at the local level once more."
USA_civil_liberties: "Loyalty to America"
USA_civil_liberties_desc: "The early 1930s was the era of loyalty to men over ideals. Haywood, Long, and even Macarthur accrued a sort of clique of allies that saw their leaders as above the law. Several Congressmen have come out to apologize for their statements made during the war."
USA_ensure_political_stability: "Ensure Political Stability"
USA_ensure_political_stability_desc: "Although it is opposed by some of the legislatures, use of the FCC to monitor the airwaves against rebel radio stations is necessary. This measure along with several other forms of censorship are still necessary to end rebel pockets within the Contiguous U.S."
USA_protect_democracy: "Protect Democracy"
USA_protect_democracy_desc: "The 17th Amendment enhanced the democratic representation in America, but failed, in the long run, to make the electoral process more democratic. Congress shall strengthen the democratic process directly through the review of poll taxes and registries of felons, to ensure the word of the law is followed."
USA_land_of_the_free: "Land of the Free"
USA_land_of_the_free_desc: "The use of penal labour in the prisoner of war camps is no longer tolerable to Congress. Although the fate of these prisoners is still up to the court's system, their exploitation in both loyal and rebel states should be rolled back."
USA_home_of_the_brave: "Home of the Brave"
USA_home_of_the_brave_desc: "The veterans of the Second Civil War have sacrificed it all to preserve their home, if only they didn't have to fight other Americans.

USA_for_the_people: "For the People"
USA_for_the_people_desc: "The people of America as a collective are our constituents and our lifeblood. A holiday in thanks to the American people has been passed through Congress to make the former Labor Day into 'The American Peoples Day' in thanks and in order to surpass the patriotism of the labour movement."
USA_future_of_the_afp: "Future of the AFP"
USA_future_of_the_afp_desc: "Congress has decided that the AFP is a traitorous party and must be treated as such. It will be banned under the 1917 Sedition Acts. Their most extreme populist ideas will have no place in our new society. However, perhaps some of their more moderate ideas could be adopted..."

USA_try_the_minutemen: "Try the Minutemen"
USA_court_populists: "Court Populist Voters"
USA_court_populists_desc: "Since the days of the Farmers Alliance, populism on the left and right has presented the greatest threat to our two party system. While the AFP must be punished, we cannot ignore the appeal of many of their ideas, specifically the ideas of greenback currency and first-past-the-post voting. These ideas will be put before Congress and voted on, to show former AFP supporters that we hear them."
USA_political_traditionalism: "Political Traditionalism"
USA_political_traditionalism_desc: "The Democratic and Republican parties have served this country for decades. The recent rise of extremist parties has shown us that we cannot tolerate third parties rising up to challenge our system. We must use our best propaganda efforts to ensure that voters regain confidence in the traditional two-party system."
USA_democratic_education: "Constitutional Education"
USA_democratic_education_desc: "A common talking point by radicals and populists was the idea that the Federal Government is a voluntary organization. Some even claim to use ridiculous false loopholes like naval law or the rights to secede from the union. We must correct this by making the U.S Constitution as widely available as possible."

### Post Civil War - Macarthur ###
USA_american_caeser: "The American Caesar"
USA_american_caeser_desc: "President MacArthur has proclaimed he would not concede victory to the very partisans who caused the civil war. His American Junta promises a national restoration and adoption of functional democracy as MacArthur sees it. Elimination of unnecessary politicians and appointment of more competent officials will bridge the gap between people and politics."
USA_army_education: "Army Education"
USA_army_education_desc: "Parent Organizations have come out to claim we willingly let children into the military underage. Our solution is to divert prospective youth into military education while keeping them in public school. The ideas of physical education and morals taught by Bellamy will revive that old Nationalist fervour that failed us in the 1910s."
USA_nationalize_boy_scouts: "National Youth of America"
USA_nationalize_boy_scouts_desc: "The pull to mandate a higher working age is countered by the multitudes of unemployed youth strewn across America. The solution is to establish a National Youth Administration in order to provide work and education to Americans too young to vote."
USA_the_american_legion: "Reforming the Legion"
USA_the_american_legion_desc: "With the American Legion National Commander Smedley Butler now a fugitive, it is necessary to rebuild the organization to remove the stain of partisan politics. No longer will National Commanders be permitted to campaign for politicians, nor will they be permitted to stay once they are career politicians."
USA_americanism: "Loyal to the Flag"
USA_americanism_desc: "Unlike the tyrants and despots that are common in the Americas, MacArthur desires not to be a Great Man, but to be a respected and mortal leader of Americans. Loyalty to the unchanging ideal of America must be put above himself, so long as MacArthur's popularity holds out."
USA_martial_law_: "Martial Law"
USA_martial_law_desc: "With Congressional Approval, habeas corpus is suspended in accordance with the constitution. As the threat of invasion from syndicalist and populist forces still looms over part of the land, it is clear that we must act to ensure a secure transition to the post-Civil War era. The writ of habeas corpus and free speech is still suspended for political expediency, and we shall institute martial law to help find any remaining rebels."
USA_restore_democracy: "American Junta"
USA_restore_democracy_desc: "When the Roman Republic was in crisis, powerful generals rose up to save the country from itself. MacArthur's deal with Eisenhower and Bradley has been partly made public, though neither the American people nor the rest of the committee will know the nature of their relationship. We must now decide who else shall serve alongside these three men in the new Junta."
USA_defending_the_republic: "Fate of the Civilian Government"
USA_defending_the_republic_desc: "The events of the last few years have shown the military that politicians cannot be trusted to keep the peace. MacArthur is confident they can run the country better than the three branches ever did. Still, these men will retain their places in our government, a relic of older times if nothing else, while the Junta holds true power. The ruling "Committee" shall make important decisions in the country now."
USA_american_legion: "Utilize the Legion"
USA_american_legion_desc: "Smedley Butler's American Legion is now under our control, and it shall have an important place in our new regime. The Legion will keep the peace and hopefully snuff out any rebellions in their infancy, while also helping our law enforcement forces to make sure laws are followed. We will never have lawlessness in our nation again!"
USA_the_committee: "The Committee"
USA_the_committee_desc: "Our new ruling committee is made up of various military officials who will collectively govern the country in the name of the American people. This is the only way we can ensure that the country survives, and the military will now have the resources it so crucially lacked before the Civil War. Though MacArthur had to give up complete power, he is still the face of the regime, and holds significant power compared to his counterparts."
USA_navy_support: "Navy Support"
USA_navy_support_desc: "One faction of the military that we have yet to court is the Navy. The U.S. Navy, like the rest of the military, was torn apart by the Civil War, yet they also played a crucial part in our victory. Their popularity means our government will not be seen as fully legitimate until we bring them in the fold and offer them a place in the new ruling committee. For now, they cannot match the power of the Army, but we should watch them to make sure that this remains the case."
USA_air_power: "Air Power"
USA_air_power_desc: "Another important factor in the war was the airplane. Our airmen bravely battled in the air, over the sea, and over battlefields during the entire duration of the conflict, and now, they deserve investment. Lessons learned in the war can help us make our air force the best in the world; new technologies have been developed and new doctrines envisioned by our air commanders."`
USA_court_generals: "Court Dissenting Generals"
USA_court_generals_desc: "Some generals did not agree with our decision to establish a military junta over the country, instead wishing for a restoration of democracy. Others are bitter that they were excluded from the Committee and demand a say in the new government. We should bring these dissenters into the fold by offering them bribes, honors, or positions outside the Committee, so that we do not have to sleep with one eye open."
USA_backroom_deals: "Backroom Deals"
USA_backroom_deals_desc: "The relationship between MacArthur, Eisenhower, and Bradley has remained a closely kept secret, and for good reason. If other members of the Committee were made aware of the triumvirate that was developing between the three, perhaps they would be able to stop it. Soon though, the combined influence of the three men will be so great that they rule the country openly, as they already do in all but name."
USA_congress_courted: "The Question of Statehood"
USA_congress_courted_desc: "Unlike the First Civil War, we must deal with the majority of the country that decided to rebel. With the national government established, we should decide what to do with rebellious states. We could follow the lesson of that war and split the regions into various military districts until reconstruction is complete, or we could keep the states as they are. However, many states split during the war, and this could be difficult. Either way, we must decide carefully, for the sake of our regime."
USA_civilianization: "Civilianization"
USA_civilianization_desc: "To better adapt our people to the new regime, the members of the committee must decide how to govern. Should we don civilian clothing and resemble politicians, or shall we keep our military garb to intimidate would-be foes? There are various other ways we can come off as more friendly to our people as well, and we should decide how we want to appraoch the delicate matter of a military government."
USA_patriot_party: "A Patriot Party?"
USA_patriot_party_desc: "With the regime now more stable, perhaps we should adopt an institution that characterized American democracy for centuries, even if it has made Washington roll in his grave. Creating a new "Patriot Party" to represent the regime could help us gain legitimacy. However, others argue that we should distance ourselves from parties, as they are what brought the country to ruin to begin with. What shall we do?"
USA_congress_freed: "Congress Released"
USA_congress_freed_desc: "It is no longer neccessary for Congress to be protected by and to answer to the American military. Special elections in our core states have decided who will guide Congress during Reconstruction, and the people may once again expect to vote for their national leaders on a regular basis. Congress is free of the shackles imposed on it during the war, finally ready to help restore the country."
USA_fbi_cointelpro: "Second American Protective League"
USA_fbi_cointelpro_desc: "As the largest part of the Continuous United States has been pacified, it is essential that American citizens remain vigilant. The reformation of the League as a free information system to report potential populist or syndicalist spies to the Federal Government and to discourage public protest is absolutely needed."
USA_control_congress: "Control Congress"
USA_control_congress_desc: "Many former Democrats and Republicans have folded into MacArthur's new regime, while holdouts have fled. Fortunately, we were able to fill their vacancies with qualified, trustworthy individuals. These new Congressmen are not politicians per se, they are instead public servants for the American people."
USA_office_of_war_information: "Signals Intelligence Service"
USA_office_of_war_information_desc: "Cryptographic machines designed to interact with its sender to create an encryption that cannot be easily broken are the newest toy in our arsenal. The Signals Intelligence Service, which required the installation of underground cables to ensure secrecy, has finally been implemented."
USA_allien_sedition_acts: "Executive Order 7250-A"
USA_allien_sedition_acts_desc: "An Executive Order signed by President MacArthur hopes to bring an end the threat of foreign infiltration. This order restores some parts of the Alien and Sedition Act. State legislatures are already appealing cases to the Supreme Court. It is firmly believed, however, that MacArthur's new judges will side in his favor."
USA_empower_the_army: "Empower the Army"
USA_empower_the_army_desc: "A crisis has already risen in our new military administration. The Army and Navy are constantly at each other's throats over funding and political kickbacks. We need to relegate the Navy to a secondary governmental position and grant the Army full power."
USA_loyal_officers: "Old Soldiers Never Die"
USA_loyal_officers_desc: "The new regime recognizes the long struggle of the officers that left their homes to protect their nation, and to the many that didn't return home. Thanks to an Executive Order, Officers may now pursue a technical education in universities or go into law. This will ensure loyalty long after we fade away."
USA_loyalty_to_macarthur: "The Commander-in-Chief"
USA_loyalty_to_macarthur_desc: "The role of the President as Commander-in-Chief goes back to President Washington. Washington set the precedent of retiring from active duty upon taking office, which MacArthur promises he will do once the national emergency is ended. Like Washington, MacArthur will remain ready to respond to threats to the nation."
USA_national_rehabilition: "National Rehabilitation"
USA_national_rehabilition_desc: "The creeds of Long and Haywood were wrong: it was not the industrialists and businessmen that caused civil strife, but the greedy career politician that gave them posts and took their money. We shall rehabilitate the capitalists to their proper position in American society."
USA_root_out_traitors: "Down With the Traitors"
USA_root_out_traitors_desc: "Our intelligence services have identified the enablers of radicalism and greed in America. They are the disloyal Prohibitionists, Grangers, Holy Rollers and foreigners that enabled the AFP and SPA to grow. These organizations have been rightfully banned for their implicit betrayal."
USA_loyalty_to_america: "Up With the Stars"
USA_loyalty_to_america_desc: "Nationalism has the goal of strengthening loyalty to the idea of America more than any American as a person. President MacArthur has chosen to refocus attention from himself to the nation as an object of admiration. No longer will a politicians ego exceed their stature, as the nation is mightier than they."
USA_american_stratocracy: "American Stratocracy"
USA_american_stratocracy_desc: "MacArthur has finally restored nationalist fervour and functional Democracy as he sees it. While some complain that career politicians have been replaced by officers, few will argue that the bureaucracy hasn't improved. The American people can now trust their politicians to use legal means to achieve their goals."
USA_defend_the_republic: "Defenders of the Republic"
USA_defend_the_republic_desc: "The militaries job is to defend American democracy at all costs, but only directly intervening to prevent the collapse of the Republic and only for as long as neccessary. This is the message we must spread throughout the ranks and in our public propaganda, both so that the American people accept MacArthur's time as leader and so the military remembers what their legitimacy is based on."
USA_the_junta: "American Junta"
USA_the_junta_desc: "MacArthur understands that he cannot rule the nation alone, and that the old democratic system is similary insufficient. Instead, he believes a council of high-ranking military officials will be able to work together to stabilize the nation. This would appease the loyal officials in the W.C.C. and would also remove the problem of establishing a successor, for now..."
USA_civil_autonomy: "Civil Autonomy"
USA_civil_autonomy_desc: "While the American junta wants as much control as possible, they understand that they cannot be everywhere at once. We will retain some of the old American practices, such as giving states and businesses some autonomy with regards to economic policy. This will make things more efficient, and lead to the creation of greater infrastructure in many of our devastated states."
USA_military_purchases: "Military Purchases"
USA_military_purchases_desc: "Never again will the United States be weak or unprepared for war. We will encourage the creation of whole industries in certain states, so that different regions of our country can specialize in different areas. The national government will then purchase from these factories, boosting the local economies in those communities as well as helping our military."
USA_limited_elections: "Safer Elections"
USA_limited_elections_desc: "Recent years have shown us the dangers of unregulated democracy. Instead, our people will choose their representatives from a list of military officials. Doing so will ensure that they are under the tight control of the ruling junta, and that a more consistent ideology can be advocated. No longer will the changes made by one man be undone as soon as his successor comes to power. This will stabilize our system."  
USA_protect_capitalism: "Capital Security Acts"
USA_protect_capitalism_desc: "The recent Second Civil War was the greatest threat to American capitalism in history. The junta will make a concentrated effort to preserve pre-war capitalism with new "Capital Security Acts". These will ensure that corporate money is guarded and will not be stolen or destroyed by anarchists. The injection of confidence into the business community will boost our economy."
USA_the_triumverant: "American Triumvirate"
USA_the_triumverant_desc: "Two men have come to prominence alongside MacArthur in the American junta. Dwight Eisenhower, a loyal man and a hard worker with a certain charisma about him, has risen to the top. Omar Bradley, a humble but mature man, has also emerged as a leading figure within the junta. Together, these three men will rule America as they see fit. All opposition will be crushed."
USA_all_american_legion: "All-American Legion"
USA_all_american_legion_desc: "We will have an American Protection Legion, which will replace the old American Protective League. This legion will serve similar purposes but with a new emphasis on patriotic and nationalist propaganda. Such efforts will make our people more dedicated to our country, and more importantly, our government. We will have eyes everywhere..."
USA_mandatory_service: "Total Patriotism"
USA_mandatory_service_desc: "Building on the amendment he drafted, MacArthur has now decided to implement mandatory service for a wider age group, to cement his position at the top of America. Every man will serve his country, and no nation on Earth will outnumber us in a future war, as we were in the Civil War."
USA_little_troopers: "Little Troopers"
USA_little_troopers_desc: "The Boy Scouts are a nice organization, but we need to raise young men who are ready for war. To this end, we will create the "Little Troopers" program, which will train young kids for real military service when they have come of age. This will give us desperately needed manpower to replace our losses in the Civil War, and make our population more patriotic." 
USA_baracks_capitalism: "Barracks Capitalism"
USA_baracks_capitalism_desc: "As of late, the phrases "Military-Industrial Complex" and "Barracks Capitalism" have been used more frequently to describe the new form of capitalism that MacArthur has pushed. With a humming war machine, he and his advisors argue, we will never have a depression again. We will outproduce our foes and bring America's full industrial might to bear on them." 
USA_salute_the_chief: "Salute the Chief"
USA_salute_the_chief_desc: "Hail to the Chief! All Americans will salute the man who has saved our country from extremists and foreign rule. MacArthur has inspired the American people and with them behind him, he is more powerful than ever before. He looks to the foreign arena now, in search of new foes."
USA_constitutional_amending: "Improve the Constitution"
USA_constitutional_amending_desc: "MacArthur's source of power is the military. However, he has expressed concern to some of his close advisors that the end of Civil War will see the U.S. return to having a weak military. To combat this, MacArthur has advocated an amendment to the constitution that would help create a permanent war machine, beginning with mandating that men of a certain age serve in the armed forces."

### Post Civil War - Reconstruction ###
USA_begin_reconstruction: "Begin Reconstruction"

USA_rebuild_railroads: "Rebuild American Railroads"
USA_rebuild_railroads_desc: "The Railroad networks that cross America are in shambles, and war-era constructions are jury-rigged to older tracks. Congress has approved of rebuilding our railroad network in the form of mandatory third rail electrification. Electrified tracks will force our energy grid to reform as a result."
USA_electrification: "Electrification Program"
USA_electrification_desc: "In order to accommodate the mandatory Third Rail, as well as ensure the safety of the more remote parts of America, an electrification project is approved to cross all state lines. Congress is now pulling state governments to fund transformers and hydroelectric power, as it is their responsibility."
USA_business_subsidies: "Business Subsidies"
USA_business_subsidies_desc: "Small businesses in America have struggled to expand their employment opportunities, which is contributing to unemployment. The issue of unsafe working conditions returning to prominence due to the need for faster production has led to agitated workers. Congress has approved of a federal purse to subsidize small businesses."
USA_rebuild_americas_industry: "Rebuild America's Industry"
USA_rebuild_americas_industry_desc: "America's exports have fallen during the depression despite taking a laissez-faire position on trade laws. Exports are also one of the main ways we measure economic activity. We must invest in the tertiary services our industrial businesses use in order to lower their bottom line and increase output."
USA_economic_investments: "Economic Investments"
USA_economic_investments_desc: "A more bold strategy is devised by Congress to assist in economic recovery. Traditional notions that government purchases are negatively associated with growth, newer theories hold that smart purchases can stimulate the economy."
USA_trial_of_american_companies: "Trial of Traitorous Companies"
USA_trial_of_american_companies_desc: "It is time for Congress to hear the testimony of the rebellious companies. Some are advocating for just their executives to resign, while others insist on piercing the corporate veil. This would allow the government to prosecute individual shareholders as responsible for decisions made."
USA_esmwt: "Fate of the Unions"
USA_esmwt_desc: "It is time for Congress to hear the testimony of rebellious unions. Some are calling for just their chair-people to resign, while others insist on collecting transcripts of union meetings, paving the way for prosecuting all active members."
USA_rebuild_the_roads: "Rebuild America's Roads"
USA_rebuild_the_roads_desc: "The state-funded interstate highway system was easy targets for sabotage. We must cooperate with the states in order to ensure safe commerce and travel through America once more."
USA_american_industry: "American Industrial Might"
USA_american_industry_desc: "The war may have temporarily reinvigorated heavy industry, but its design was temporary and facilities were essentially built on top of closed factories. We must bring our safety and management efficiencies to bear in order to make this upswing permanent."
USA_rebuild_agriculture: "Rebuild Agricultural Industry"

USA_americanism_desc: "Unlike the tyrants and despots that are common in the Americas, MacArthur desires not to be a great man, but to be a respected and mortal leader of Americans.

USA_loyalty_to_macarthur: "The Commander-in-Chief"
USA_loyalty_to_macarthur_desc: "The role of the President as Commander-in-Chief goes back to President Washington.

USA_national_rehabilition_desc: "It is time for us to emerge from the Civil War as a new nation, a rehabilitated nation. Various groups have been demonized; industrialists, immigrants, minorities, and more. It is time that we all become Americans once again.

Vast changes are coming, and it is up to us now to see the country into a new era of prosperity, leaving the misery of recent times behind."
USA_root_out_traitors: "Root out Traitors"
USA_root_out_traitors_desc: "Our intelligence services have identified the enablers of radicalism and greed in America.

USA_loyalty_to_america: "Loyalty to America"
USA_loyalty_to_america_desc: "Nationalism has the goal of strengthening loyalty to the idea of America more than any American as a person.

USA_demand_repayment: "Demand Repayment of War Debts"
USA_demand_repayment_desc: "The United Kingdom incurred an enormous war debt to us during the Weltkrieg. That debt has been inherited by Canada.

USA_reconciliation_with_canada: "Reconciliation with Canada"
USA_reconciliation_with_canada_desc: "The isolationists are elated, but at the cost of our relations with Canada. We can try rebuilding those relations by offering a compromise: some assistance from Canada now, with the debt deferred until after the war. In exchange, we'll reduce the import tariffs from the Entente."
USA_pass_tariff_act: "Pass the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act"
USA_pass_tariff_act_desc: "Canada refused to repay the war debts - unsurprisingly - and thus in return our only option is to pass punitive tariffs on Entente goods imported into the US. That will put some money in our coffers, though repairing relations with Canada will take a long, long time."

USA_fight_anarchists_desc: "Long's dreams of sharing the wealth cannot be achieved so long as the SPA has a choke-hold on American labor with the general strike ongoing since the beginning of the year. They must be brought down before America can live."
USA_president_reed: "President Haywood"
USA_president_reed_desc: "Bill Haywood has become the first socialist president of the United States of America. The SPA does not, however, control Congress, and thus he will have a difficult time delivering on his promises of mending the exploitative relationship of labor and capital."

USA_the_hoover_raids: "The Hoover Raids"
USA_the_hoover_raids_desc: "There is a great sense of urgency in the calls to crush these insurgencies as harshly as possible. The director of the FBI, John Edgar Hoover, has suggested to President Hoover that the best way to solve the crisis of these riots is to begin targeting their organizers along with their suppliers. Many of the more liberal members of Hoover's cabinet fear emboldening the FBI director, which could cause the same repression of civil liberties seen during the Wilson and Palmer administrations."
USA_dealing_with_the_riots: "Dealing with the Riots"
USA_dealing_with_the_riots_desc: "Ever since Hoover's victory in 1936, riots have broken out across the country, with local police no longer able to handle the crisis. Members of Hoover's cabinet such as Douglas MacArthur have advised Hoover to send the military in to deal with these riots. Others, such as Henry Ford, have suggested less radical solutions such as simply using the National Guard's of each state to break up the riots. Still other members have told Hoover that the police will get a hold of the situation given enough time or that Hoover should focus on fixing the economy and these riots will simmer down."
USA_4_more_years: "Four More Years!"
USA_4_more_years_desc: "Despite the odds, and thanks to the Republican and Democratic House members who backed him, Hoover will begin his third term as President of the United States.

USA_today_we_are_scrounging_for_a_meal_desc: "Hoover's previous two terms as president saw a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the local wildlife and farmlands of America's prairies.

USA_today_we_are_living_in_a_shanty_desc: "Homelessness was present before the Great Depression, and was a common sight before 1925, however most large cities built municipal lodging houses for the homeless, but the Depression exponentially increased demand.

USA_you_made_us_what_we_are_today: "You Made Us What We Are Today"
USA_you_made_us_what_we_are_today_desc: "Tensions across the nation were already high enough, but with Hoover's nomination and subsequent victory on the 1936 Republican ticket, many across the nation are angry, wishing their preferred candidate had won the election. Many of these individuals have begun protesting the election results, and the most violent of these individuals have begun assaulting and burning buildings. The police are barely able to handle the clashes between the ODP and SPA members, but with the AFP also in the mix and massively upset with the loss of Long, things have spun out of control. Washington D.C looks more like a battleground everyday, and many within the Government are feeling as this is a problem that the police can not handle."
USA_we_would_like_to_thank_you_herb: "We Would Like to Thank You Herb"
USA_we_would_like_to_thank_you_herb_desc: "Hoover was originally praised for the government works that he implemented, but as time went on, unemployment continued rising. While we seemed to finally be turning the corner in 1936, the events of Black Monday saw the economic situation in America worsen even more. Hoover was criticized for almost every program he proposed in that time. His public works projects, designed to create jobs, have been characterized as wasteful government spending. His efforts to promote local relief programs, rather than asking Congress to create nationwide relief programs, have been viewed as a callous disregard for the unemployed."
USA_now_is_prosperity_around_the_corner: "Now is Prosperity Around the Corner?"
USA_now_is_prosperity_around_the_corner_desc: "With the inauguration of Herbert Hoover on January 20th 1937, he has begun his third term as President overseeing a nation in panic, with riots everywhere and a state of near lawlessness across the country. Many close to the President and the nation as a whole see him as both defeated and pessimistic. Hoover's Vice President Knox has gone after the Radical across the nation slamming them as a danger to the American economy by wishing to tax away capital, encouraging waste and throttling America’s entrepreneurial spirit."
USA_house_of_unamerican_activites: "House of Un-American Activites"
USA_house_of_unamerican_activites_desc: "For the longest time Hoover has let radicals run across America. However,Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives have finally had enough, and under the leadership of Republican J. Parnell Thomas, they have done something about it. Along with the support of Democrat colleges such as Martin Dies Jr., these Republicans have begun to investigate what they and the committee see as radicals across America, investigating the SPA, ODP, and AFP. Some of the more fervent supporters of Thomas are calling for an investigation of both the military and Hollywood as well."
USA_working_with_the_democrats: "Working with the Democrats"
USA_working_with_the_democrats_desc: "While many cannot remember a time of Democrats and Republicans working together, it has happened before, and the time has once again come to work with our traditional rivals. Otherwise, both of our parties could be destroyed by the sea of radical far-left and far-right Populists, along with those socialists in the Midwest."
USA_embrace_knoxs_economics: "Embrace Knox's Economics"
USA_embrace_knoxs_economics_desc: "During his tenure as part owner of the Chicago "Daily News", Frank Knox was critical of wasteful government spending of the Hoover Administration along with the proposed plans of those by the Radicals across the Country. Now, as Vice President Knox has taken command of the economic policy of the Hoover administration, his focus is on balancing the federal budget along with relieving both individuals and businesses of the "excessive burdens of taxation.""
USA_investigate_the_odp: "Investigate the ODP"
USA_investigate_the_odp_desc: "The split of the Democrat Party was not as severe in the beginning, as the Republicans broke with the Progressive wing of their own party, so it evened out. However, that changed as over time, and more of the "Solid South" broke with the mainstream Democrat Party and began running their own candidates. These actions came to hurt the mainstream Democrat Party in the same way the 1912 election destroyed their rivals. While this would not have been a problem normally, the expansion of the Old Democrat Party to areas outside of the Solid South has been a worrying development. Worse, we have seen Klan activity spread further outside of the Solid South in much larger numbers than we have ever seen before. The time has come to investigate both the ODP and the Ku Klux Klan."
USA_investigate_the_spa: "Investigate the SPA"
USA_investigate_the_spa_desc: "The Socialist Party of America was founded in 1901, but during the Wilson and Palmer administration from 1912-1928, the country saw massive political repression of the SPA along with other Socialist groups. However, with Hoover's first term, he calmed tensions with the SPA. When the SPA began to evolve into the CSA and participate as a major part of it, this coalition of trade unions across the Midwest began to use political violence for their own ends. Such violence increasingly occurred between members of the CSA and the Klan and Old Democratic Party. The Failure of the SPA in 1932 lead to election violence across the Midwest between members of the SPA and various other political parties from Old Democrat Party members all the way to members of the Progressive Party. With the SPA's second defeat, now in the 1936 election, we have seen massive riots across the Midwest and various Strikes occurring. The violence of the CSA has led questions about the continued existence of the SPA."
USA_balancing_the_budget: "Balancing the Budget"
USA_balancing_the_budget_desc: "Knox has made a name for himself as a crusading politician over the past decade, wishing to reform the Federal Government with his ideas about Economics. His first plan is to balance the Federal Budget, which would help deal with years of wasteful spending on the part of Herbert Hoover. But now the question remains-how will he do that?"
USA_we_wont_let_it_happen_here: "It Can't Happen Here"
USA_we_wont_let_it_happen_here_desc: ""There are some principles that cannot be compromised. Either we shall have a society based upon ordered liberty and the initiative of the individual, or we shall have a planned society that means dictation no matter what you call it or who does it. There is no half-way ground. They cannot be mixed." - Herbert Hoover"
USA_appoint_new_judges: "Appoint New Judges"
USA_appoint_new_judges_desc: "With the Hoover Administration working more closely with the conservative Democrats, many within the liberal wing of the Republican party have begun calling out Hoover's inaction and perceived traitor status. Some of the further left members of the liberal wing have even gone so far as to join the Progressive Party. Openings on the Supreme Court along with the lower courts have given Hoover the ability the mend fences with the liberals of his party, however. However many of the Democrats that have been working with the Republicans have been pushing for their candidates for the Supreme Court along with the lower courts."
USA_investigate_the_afp: "Investigate the AFP"
USA_investigate_the_afp_desc: "The America First Party has a syncretic populist party that spans from Louisiana across the Prairie States, and across as wide of an ideological spectrum as well. This party has taken members from Democrats, Republicans, and Progressives. The party has a very militant wing, along with militia group commonly known as the Minutemen. These Minutemen have engaged in various battles both against the Klan and CSA card carriers, but their more extreme language, visions of reform, and violent militia activity have called the entire party into question. The Thomas Committee will begin their hearings with members of the party."

So, the question is how to bring both our people and America back from the brink..."

Now comes the more important question: how will President Hoover solve this problem?"
USA_investigate_hollywood: "Investigate Hollywood?"
USA_investigate_hollywood_desc: "While Hollywood is a very Republican institution, it is perhaps necessary to launch an investigation into their conduct, to determine the strength of traitorous factions within the film industry. Many within the Democratic Party and the conservative wing of the Republican Party have grown suspicious of Hollywood due to the amount of movies produced over the past decade that appear very sympathetic to pro-Marxist and pro-Syndicalist thought."
USA_investigate_the_military: "Investigate the Military?"
USA_investigate_the_military_desc: "Suspicions between the Federal Government and the military have existed since the start of Hoover's second term.

USA_modernize_cavalry_tactics_desc: "It was apparent from our observers in the Weltkrieg that new tactics and technologies are becoming vital in the battlefield.

USA_long_range_escorts: "Long Range Escorts"
USA_long_range_escorts_desc: "While having better bombers is vital to win the war of tomorrow at the enemy's doorstep, these bombers can seldom operate on their own.

USA_woman_army_corps: "Create the Women's Army Corps"
USA_woman_army_corps_desc: "Despite protests from socially conservative elements in the US Army, the Commander in Chief has stood firm in defence of the Women’s Army Corps.

USA_cult_of_aviation: "Spaatz's Air Superiority"
USA_cult_of_aviation_desc: "General Carl Spaatz has long since been growing in notoriety within the USAAC and USAAF.

### Events - Pre Election ###

ustates.1.t: "The United States in 1936"
ustates.1.d: "In 1936, the United States of America is gripped by unrelenting crisis. Relieved it had managed to avoid the horrors of the Weltkrieg, Woodrow Wilson was the first US president to run and win a third-term as the “Man Who Kept the Peace” alongside his new running mate, former Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer. This political victory was short-lived however as Wilson suffered a stroke shortly after his election, setting off a constitutional crises and struggle for power in the cabinet until Wilson died in late 1923. Until then Wilson, Palmer and the cabinet reacted to the French and British Revolutions and growth of American syndicalism with increasingly extreme crackdowns on union organizing and eventually a slew of organizations suspected to have connections to the radical left. As workers became increasingly radicalized and anarchist bombers made several attempts on Palmer’s life the political situation deteriorated alongside the economy due to a combination of strikes, political instability and a loss of trading partners. \n\nPalmer’s own controversial presidency ended with the election of Herbert Hoover in 1928 who attempted to calm the situation with a “Return to Normalcy”, re-legalizing non-violent syndicalist outlets. This ultimately did little to help as a cumulation of speculative investing sent the United States spiraling into the 1929 Great Panic and allowed the Berlin Stock Market to take its place at the forefront of the world economy.\n\nThe election of Herbert Hoover in 1928, while initially promising, failed to reverse the decline of the American economy and the Great Panic has created one of the worst financial crisis it had ever seen. This has fueled the rise of radical politics in America such as the far-left Socialist Party of America, the populist Share the Wealth Society under Huey Long and his national America First Party, and the far-right Old Democratic Party, which places the blame of syndicalist and civil rights uprisings at the feet of immigrants, Republican cosmopolitism and liberal toleration of the left. Hoover's contentious re-election through the House of Representatives in 1932, and the ongoing Great Depression means that these problems are unlikely to be resolved any time soon. Many throughout the country fear the upheaval that would result should one of the extreme parties come to power, or should the Depression continue unabated."
ustates.1.a: "God Save America."

ustates.1200.t: "Death of Roy D. Chapin"
ustates.1200.d: "The United States Secretary of Commerce Roy D. Chapin has died today due to a severe heart attack. A close ally of Herbert Hoover within the Republican Party, Chapin has desperately attempted to work with businesses, especially those in the motor industry, to undo the severeness of the Great Depression. With Vice President Charles Curtis only having survived his own heart attack earlier this month due to it occuring in the White House with medical staff on stand-by, many see this as both a symbolic and literal example of the old political class passing away in favor of new movements although the Republican Party has protested such claims."
ustates.1200.a: "A tragedy"

ustates.2.t: "Black Monday hits America"
ustates.2.d: "Despite the political turmoil and ineffectual economic relief programs, it seemed to many as if the economy of the United States might finally be undergoing a slow recovery after the Great Panic of 1929. Black Monday has put an end to such hopes, and has sounded the death-knell for an already ailing economy. Republicans and Democrats have both pledged to fix the economy should they win the election, though public confidence in them is rapidly waning. Haywood, William H. Murray and Long finally seem to agree on something as they have all railed against the corrupt banking and political sectors, which they blame for allowing the crash to happen."
ustates.2.a: "This is just not our year."

ustates.3.t: "National Unity Agreement"
ustates.3.d: "The 1936 election is looking to be one of the most contentious in American history. Many politicians within the upper circle of the Republican and Democratic Parties fear that a victory by the Socialist Party of America, the America First Party, or the Old Democrats would mean the end of America and the American way of life.\n\nIn order to avoid this, a plan has been proposed by the Republican Party, in which they will nominate a member of both the conservative and progressive wings of their party to their ticket to guarantee a moderate platform. As part of the agreement the Republicans will not run candidates in the “Solid South” to give traditional democrats a better chance and likewise will not run party-endorsed candidates in Progressive heavy areas. This plan is unlikely to be popular with lower ranking members of the parties, but it may be the only thing that can prevent the radical parties from gaining strength. Most importantly, all parties agree that whichever party between the three of them wins a plurality of the vote for President will be endorsed by the other two parties for President in the House of Representatives. Despite his lack of public popularity President Hoover is still head of the Republican Party his support would be invaluable to gaining support for the plan from more Senators."
ustates.3.a: "Endorse the Agreement"
ustates.3.b: "A Coalition would debase the democratic system."

ustates.3001.t: "Republican Nomination Disagreement"
ustates.3001.d: "The Republican Party is united in its goal to save America and preserve liberal democracy but as per usual a disagreement has arisen over whether a member of the parties progressive or conservative wing will be the President to oversee this. Representing the parties moderate conservatives is Charles Curtis, vice-President of the United States who is well-renowned for his negotiating abilities amongst politicians, giving him a moderate's appeal that crosses party lines. However, representing the more liberal wing of the party is famed businessman and Kansas Governor Alf Landon whom favors more direct economic intervention in the economy and could win over progressive Republicans whom recently defected to the left-leaning Progressive Party. While the loser will be the others vice-presidential candidate to show party solidarity Hoover using his little remaining political capital to back a candidate could make or break them."
ustates.3001.a: "Back Curtis"
ustates.3001.b: "Back Landon"

ustates.4.t: "Southern Democrats Demand Support"
ustates.4.d: "The Southern Democrats are demanding increased electoral protection from their new competition, particularly the more radical White Leaguers. Although they are quite conservative they are facing stiff competition from their right and primary challenges from the Old Democrats as well as challenges to their power by populist America First party supporters. Although the Republican Party and the Southern Democrats have long been mortal enemies many liberals nonetheless consider them a neccessary bulwark for a coalition in favor of liberal democracy when the election comes about. With many conservative Democrats already becoming Old Democrats in all but name should we stop the bleeding by giving electoral boosts by signing off on some of their pork belly requests, despite them being our historical opposition?"
ustates.4.a: "Give them cover"
ustates.4.b: "Who cares?"

ustates.5.t: "Democratic Nomination"
ustates.5.d: "The Democratic Party has nominated the Texas Representative John Nance Garner whose political clout was derived from being the Speaker of the House for the past two years. Garner is a well-known anti-radical who won the nomination on the back of two promises: to preserve the economic progress made by Wilson and to preserve liberty at all costs. As Wilson remains controversial even within the party this raised a fair amount of debate and angered members of the party who felt Garner was too conservative and out-of-touch to be president. Nonetheless, he has much more support than not within what remains of a Democratic Party that is increasingly being absorbed by either the Old Democrats on its right-wing or the AFP and Progressives on its left. Garner's promise to preserve democracy without giving into any form of radicalism and denouncing those who would give extreme compromises to them is appealing to many fearful of America's increasing political unstability."
ustates.5.a: "Damn Democrats..."

ustates.5001.t: "Progressive Nomination"
ustates.5001.d: "Vocally opposing the Home Rule Plan as empowering extremist elements in the country, longtime liberal, Nebraska Senator and respected statesman George Norris accepted the Progressive Party nomination for president, a party that begun as a breakaway faction from the Republican Party, disaffected by the GOP's conservative handling of the economy since the Great Depression. Saying the problems in the American political system was a symptom of unfair economic policies and lack of opportunity, Norris endorsed a massive project to reinvest in poor communities and work with union leaders to not only stabilize the country but "make it truly fair". Liberal Democrats, disaffected by the nomination of Garner, have shown interest in his message."
ustates.5001.a: "Damn Splitters..."

ustates.6.t: "Curtis' Nomination"
ustates.6.d: "In a massive rally in Sacramento with leading members from the Republican and Democratic Parties, Vice-President Charles Curtis himself came out to accept his nomination as the Republican presidential candidate. This massive rally has been surprisingly well received by the press and those attending it. Hopefully, it can translate to election results."
ustates.6.a: "Let us pray that this helps us."

ustates.6001.t: "Landon's Nomination"
ustates.6001.d: "In a massive rally in Sacramento with leading members from the Republican and Democratic Parties, Alf Landon himself came out to accept his nomination as the Republican presidential candidate. This massive rally has been surprisingly well received by the press and those attending it. Hopefully, it can translate to election results."
ustates.6001.a: "Let us pray that this helps us."

ustates.7.t: "Fighting in Indiana"
ustates.7.d: "Indiana is quickly descending into one of the most quarrelsome states in the union with both the Socialists and Old Democrats having a foothold there. Politicians traveling with bodyguards, vandalism of enemy headquarters and the occasional missing activist from each side has become common. The situation grows worse as militia members grow increasingly bold in their attacks on each other as they realize the National Guard can not contain them. We need to reinforce the region but a question of whether we should try to hold the whole state or station our troops in Central Indiana where the Klan has a far greater presence or in the North where the SPA is based is the question."
ustates.7.a: "Keep both sides under control"
ustates.7.b: "Fight the Klan"
ustates.7.c: "Fight the Socialists"
ustates.7.e: "We can't spare many resources right now"

ustates.8.t: "Nominating Quentin Roosevelt"
ustates.8.d: "Since the nomination of Senator Norris as the Progressive presidential candidate, the politically minded have discussed with great interest the likely vice-presidential candidate. Finally putting the rumors to rest, Quentin Roosevelt was announced as the VP for the Progressive ticket yesterday in New York City. In his announcement, he emphasized wanting to help bring major reforms to the country through a plan called the Fair Deal. The nomination is a shock to the Republican political class whom don't care to see the descendant of a popular president joining another party when he had a "bright future" at the GOP, perhaps remembering the results of Theodore Roosevelt founding the original Progressive Party and splitting the ticket as a result."
ustates.8.a: "A deal that is fair and a deal that is square."

ustates.9.t: "Indian Citizenship Act"
ustates.9.d: "In order to gain more sympathy from the North and the West, it has been proposed by the Senate and the House that the Indian Citizenship Bill be passed, effectively elevating all indigenous peoples of the United States from second-class citizens to full citizenship. Northeastern and Western politicians in both the major parties support this, while some Southern Democrats and Northern Republicans have deemed it frivolous."
ustates.9.a: "Pass the Act, hopefully, this will gain us some sympathy!"
ustates.9.b: "Veto the Bill, this is no time for populism."

ustates.10.t: "Old Democrats announce Nominee"
ustates.10.d: "The Old Democrats have officially announced their expected candidate for this year's presidential race, denouncing the more centrist-conservative wing of the Democratic Party and its liberal members as 'sell-outs' to Republican Industrialists, Catholics, Jewish money, and Washington Bureaucrats at their convention. Originally a faction formed as a reaction to the growth of syndicalism and a reinvigorated civil rights movement, it also gained strength as a result of Woodrow Wilson and A. Mitchell Palmer's encouraging of increasingly radical forms of anti-socialism during the First Red Scare. Republican tariffs during the Great Depression that have harmed agriculture have led to greater support for the movement. Today, they declared their nominee for president to be their longtime de-facto leader and Governor of Oklahoma, William H. Murray, who said that he's running a campaign against "Communists, Corporations and Miscegenation". He received support from the Fordist Democrats, an informal name for a group of national-corporatist and urban-based Northern Democrats lead by Charles Lindbergh and Henry Ford, as well as the Ku Klux Klan and their affiliates within the National Democratic White League."
ustates.10.a: "Not even more radical candidates"

ustates.11.t: "Increasing Radicalization"
ustates.11.d: "With the Democrats and Republicans fighting among themselves, as usual, more and more Americans are feeling alienated from the traditional big two and are flocking to the populist AFP, Old Democrats and SPA throughout the country. In these dark times, the distinction between genuine social reform and graft is hard to distinguish. Those under the radical banner in their political enclaves have received some social welfare with Share Our Wealth donations from the AFP, International Red Aid from the SPA and the machine handouts and White League protections from the Old Democrats. The party machine of these radicals utilizes mass media to a much stronger degree than either the Republicans or Democrats. It is looking more and more like the 1936 election will come down to Haywood, Murray or Long."
ustates.11.a: "Not great."

ustates.12.t: "Progressives flock from the GOP"
ustates.12.d: "Minnesota, which has become the bastion of the Progressive Senator Floyd Olson, has continued to flip away from the traditional parties, mainly the Republicans. Many people are turning away from the Republicans on the direction of the Progressives, AFP and even SPA. Various unions have held rallies for these parties, and attendance far outstrips our ability to out-shout them."
ustates.12.a: "Is it something in the water?"

ustates.13.t: "Southern Democrat voters align with the Old Democrats"
ustates.13.d: "The South has long been considered the heartland of the traditional Democratic elites but this may not be the case for much longer, as polls show a massive spike in votes for the Old Democrats and support for their nominee. On a radio broadcast, William H. Murray spoke at length about his plans for America and ending threats to "the white American way of life". It seems that Old Democrat support is growing stronger by the day and they have pledged to run campaigns against mainstream Democrats who continue working with the Republican party."
ustates.13.a: "What devious madmen"

ustates.14.t: "MacArthur speaks to Hoover"
ustates.14.d: "MacArthur has spoken to President Hoover privately about a contingency plan called War Plan White, a military plan for dealing with a possible armed uprising of US citizens. The plan would call on MacArthur to take emergency action to protect the country, and re-erect old barricades in Washington D.C. This plan can be engaged even from outside Washington D.C, at the Washington Arsenal. While the plan has obviously not been made public, we at least have it as a contingency if the radicals enact one of their revolutions from within the government. MacArthur went on to request permission to hold New Mexico which has seen activity from both the Klan and Minutemen but some in the cabinet are nervous about empowering MacArthur further, feeling he is abusing his authority."
ustates.14.a: "Denied"
ustates.14.b: "Grant Support"

ustates.15.t: "The Battle of the Overpass"
ustates.15.d: "In Detroit, Michigan, the automotive capital of the world, Walter Reuther and Richard Frankenstein, the leaders of the United Auto Workers association, called a general strike against the Ford Motor Company and proclaim themselves for 'Unionism, Not Ford-ism', demanding higher pay and fewer hours for automotive workers.\n\nAt 2:00 PM today, a photographer from the Detroit Free Press asked to take a photo of the leaders of the UAW standing on the overpass with the Ford sign in the background. While they were posing, a group of forty men from the Ford's Service Department, approached them from behind and began to beat them with their batons. The group then continued their attack on some of the beret-wearing women present to pass out leaflets."
ustates.15.a: "This will hurt us more than it hurt the Unionists!"

ustates.16.t: "Representatives Retiring"
ustates.16.d: "Many Republicans and Democratic Representatives have announced that this year will be their last year in Congress. While many retirees claim old age motivated them, rumors of gang intimidation by the SPA, Old Democrats and AFP Congressmen reminds many of the Congressional brawl between Charles Sumner and Preston Brooks. The unprecedented rate of their retirement has given hope to the AFP, Old Democrats and SPA that they can win these open elections."
ustates.16.a: "Let us hope they get good replacements."

ustates.17.t: "Violence between radicals"
ustates.17.d: "In a number of major cities, conflicts between supporters of the America First Party, Old Democrats and the Socialist Party have broken out in violence. Partisan fist fights and even shoot-outs are starting to become a regular occurrence throughout the country as the country spirals ever deeper into chaos. While public eruptions are easy to counter, the enclaves these radicals have cut out of city blocks run on graft are harder to stop."
ustates.17.a: "This is just not our year."

ustates.1700.t: "MacArthur's Independence Day Address"
ustates.1700.d: "Broadcasting from New York City, Douglas MacArthur gave a radio address this 4th of July that denounced the violence between radicals and promised the American people that the military was more than prepared to restore order. While this is all and good, there is the issue that MacArthur did not even alert the president that he would be speaking to the nation. Charles Curtis is infuriated but others in our cabinet clearly admire the MacArthur 'clique' and his ability to reasurre many establishment figures that he can restore order to the nation. Nonetheless, this can not be a good sign for democracy but while MacArthur has too many followers in our military to fire we could reprimand him, for whatever that's worth."
ustates.1700.a: "Reprimand him"
ustates.1700.b: "Leave it be"

ustates.18.t: "Charles Coughlin's Radio Broadcasts"
ustates.18.d: "Three years ago today, Father Charles Coughlin began a weekly radio broadcast in America, and now has an audience of over 50 million people. A leading AFP activist, he is a conspiracy-minded populist who claims that the Syndicalist Revolution in France was 'fomented by the German elite' and that the Berlin Stock Market Crash is an 'International conspiracy of Bankers' and somehow people still tune in to his radical agenda which calls for a near-overthrow of the US government. His extreme and unorthodox rhetoric is barely tolerated by the Church, and the Pope is expected to make a decision whether to ask the United States government to shut down his broadcast so that his message cannot reach the public."
ustates.18.a: "Coughlin is becoming a danger to the public, shut him down."
ustates.18.b: "I hate what he says, but I defend his right to say it."

ustates.19.t: "Huey Long Speaks"
ustates.19.d: "The Democratic Party and the Republican Party were just like the old patent medicine drummer that used to come around our county. He had two bottles of medicine. He'd play the banjo and he'd sell two bottles of medicine.\n\nOne of those bottles of medicine was called High Popalorum and another one of those bottles of medicine was called Low Popahirum.\n\nFinally somebody around there said is there any difference in these bottles of medicines? 'Oh,' he said, 'considerable. They're both good but they're different,' he said.\n\n'That High Popalorum is made from the bark off the tree that we take from the top down. And that Low Popahirum is made from the bark that we take from the root up.'\n\nAnd the only difference that I have found between the Democratic leadership and the Republican leadership was that one of 'em was skinning you from the ankle up and the other from the ear down — when I got to Congress."
ustates.19.a: "Homely sayings do not win elections."

ustates.20.t: "The Ohio Scandal"
ustates.20.d: "A major scandal has broken out in Ohio, to the point of grabbing national attention even in these trying times. It appears the notorious political organization called the 'Ohio Gang' led by Ohio governor Harry M. Daugherty has come under investigation for selling firearms from their armory's to nearby militias with the aid of bootlegger George Remus after one of the affected armories officers broke down to questioning regarding missing supply shipments, claiming that Dougherty fixer Jess Smith acted as the middleman. The scandal is further damaging the reputation of the established political class despite Hoover being a foe of the group. Perhaps we should denounce them to distance ourselves further, albeit at the cost of incurring powerful political foes."
ustates.20.a: "Denounce these madmen!"
ustates.20.b: "It is not my place to comment"

ustates.20001.t: "Jess Smith Dies!"
ustates.20001.d: "Shortly after somehow successfully making bail Jess Smith was found dead in his apartment in what appears to be a suicide by gunshot. Of course, few are believing the story and it has made the now so-called "Springfield Scandal" (named for the rifle often sold to militia groups) into an even greater sensation. Perhaps we should further investigate his death to calm fears that the political system is utterly corrupt even if doing so will partially vindicate various radical populists already spouting conspiracies around the subject such as Charles Coughlin, Gerald Burton Winrod and Smedley Butler."
ustates.20001.a: "Send the FBI"
ustates.20001.b: "Leave it alone"

ustates.21.t: "Political Violence Grows - Failed Assassination Attempt"
ustates.21.d: "An assassination attempt occurred on ODP Vice Presidential candidate John E. Rankin when an anarchist fired on him from a crowd. For some time the violence has been mostly between the supporters of the radical parties, however recently the violence is now reaching the candidates and politicians themselves. Failed attempts on the lives of both Huey Long and Bill Haywood have occurred in the past few months. Both gunmen shooting from a crowd, both failed, and both resulted in higher security. Several more local politicians have been stabbed during a campaign rally. Moreover, voters from both extremes are turning a blind eye to the violence done to their enemies."
ustates.21.a: "Great, more violence."

ustates.22.t: "May Day Riots"
ustates.22.d: "May Day, International Workers day, this is a holiday that the Socialist Party celebrates with numerous parades and speeches and has since its founding. Generally, things are peaceful, though there have been confrontations with the police. However this time things are more violent than normal. Clashes between the Socialists and the local police backed up by the AFP and ODP have occurred around the country. The question is who is at fault? The Socialists declare that things were peaceful till the police and the Ku Klux Klan arrived on the scene. The Old Democrats are saying that the Socialists began by assaulting non-unionized workers, and have blurry photos they claim are guns the SPA were brandishing."
ustates.22.a: "The SPA were at fault."
ustates.22.b: "The police were at fault."

ustates.23.t: "Saint Patrick's Day Flood"
ustates.23.d: "On March 16, 1936, warmer than usual temperatures led to the melting of large amounts of snow and ice on the upper Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. The rivers and their tributaries had already overflowed their banks and were soon threatening the city of Pittsburgh. On March 17, 1936, the waters reached the flood stage of twenty-five feet. Then, overnight, heavy rain caused the water to rise even higher, and on March 18, the water peaked at about forty-six feet, twenty-one feet above the flood stage.\n\nThis is the worst such disaster in the city's history, and local authorities have already requested federal aid."
ustates.23.a: "We must help the people."
ustates.23.b: "They will have to help themselves."

ustates.24.t: "Red Summer"
ustates.24.d: "The summer heat has turned into violence and blood as cities, starting with Charleston, South Carolina, throughout the country engaged in bloody racial riots as whites beat up blacks and burned black businesses. The number of lynchings that occurred throughout the country spiked during the summer. In response, The African Blood Brotherhood and other elements of the SPA and CSA have begun arming and fighting back. The Socialist Party of America have defended their actions, and have furnished blurry photos they claim show Old Democrat members in lynch mobs."
ustates.24.a: "Can this year get any worse?"

ustates.25.t: "Special Election in New Jersey!"
ustates.25.d: "Following Senator A. Harry Moore's resignation in order to run for governor, a special election has been called in New Jersey to select his replacement. The front-runners are Democrat John Gerald Milton and Old Democrat supporter Charles Lindbergh. Polls have just closed, and the winner appears to be..."
ustates.25.a: "John Gerald Milton (Democratic Party)"
ustates.25.b: "Charles Lindbergh (Old Democratic Party)"

ustates.26.t: "Special Election in Washington"
ustates.26.d: "Following the death of Senator Wesley Lloyd, a special election has been called in Washington to fill his seat. The front-runners are SPA activist John F. McKay and Democratic Congressman John Main Coffee. Polls have just closed, and the winner appears to be..."
ustates.26.a: "John F. McKay (Socialist Party)"
ustates.26.b: "John Main Coffee (Democratic Party)"

ustates.27.t: "Crime Spree Sweeps the Nation"
ustates.27.d: "As America spirals ever deeper into chaos, there has been a wave of crime throughout the country. Many of these criminals are getting sensationalist news stories about their activities, especially gangsters like bank robber John Dillinger, Chicago crime boss Al Capone and the scandalous Bonnie & Clyde. Thankfully the Bureau of Investigation has been working hard to catch these criminals and bring some order back to America, although they have requested an increase in funding claiming they have a shortage of manpower. Of course, the AFP, ODP and SPA have begun attributing these crimes to moral decline and robber baronies."
ustates.27.a: "Increase FBI funding!"
ustates.27.b: "We can not spare anything at the moment"

ustates.28.t: "Report: Paramilitary Growth"
ustates.28.d: "With violence and instability sweeping the country, J. Edgar Hoover has sent in a report that the AFP and SPA have begun growing their existing paramilitary militias, which they claim is necessary to protect their supporters from either the government, vigilantes associated with the Old Democrats or even each other. The AFP have called their group 'the Minutemen' while the SPA's calls their militants 'the Red Guard'. Meanwhile the Old Democrats are associated with various white supremacist paramilitary groups, especially a revanchist national Klan who seen consistent growth as result of "immigrant radicalism" and a push for further recruitment pressed for by Hiram Wesley Evans, the apparent heir of Grand Wizard William Joseph Simmons. Patrolling the party strongholds and party rallies, these well-armed and equipped paramilitary units have already engaged in scattered, though extremely violent conflicts. We believe the paramilitaries are modifying civilian firearms, and the FBI's attempts to seize weapon stockpiles are too slow to stop gun runners. This could turn very bad, very fast."
ustates.28.a: "Damn it!"

ustates.29.t: "Eugene Talmadge Flips!"
ustates.29.d: "Georgia governor Eugene Talmadge has formally declared himself a member of the Old Democratic Party after being a lifelong member of the Democratic Party which he claims is "selling out" true Americans. A political faction with an ambiguous relationship to the Democratic Party they appear to primary Democrats they disapprove of whenever possible and when it's not they run on their own ticket. When they win they nonetheless often caucus with the Democrats whom often dislike them but need their support. However it is clear the ODP is displacing sections of both parties, including the Klan controlled Indiana Republican Party which has seen increasing defections to the ODP which it is a member of in all but name anyways, and Talmadge's declaration has set off yet another wave of Democratic defectors to the ODP, especially in the American Southeast."
ustates.29.a: "Bastard!"

ustates.30.t: "More SPA members announcing Congressional bids"
ustates.30.d: "While there have been a number of lawmakers from the Socialist Party of America in the past few decades, particularly in the Steel Belt, the 1936 election represents an unprecedented number of people registering to run for office under the banner of the SPA and just as many, if not more nationwide, pledging to vote for them. Both Big Bill Haywood and John Lewis have begun increasing campaigning for their respective factions of the SPA to the enthusiasm of American socialists."
ustates.30.a: "Reds!"

ustates.30010.t: "Lieutenant Governor Assassinated!"
ustates.30010.d: "Emmett T. Anderson, the Republican Lieutenant Governor of Washington state, was killed when he exited his home and two assassins exited their vehicle out front and gunned him down with .38 revolvers. Anderson was a supporter of Civil Rights in the region and the KKK-affiliated Royal Riders of the Red Robe are strongly rumored to have committed the act. An auxiliary of the KKK for white Anglo-Saxons whom are not technically naturalized American citizens most of the Red Riders are Canadian-born supporters of the Klan whose leader, J. Arthur Herdon, was increasingly opposed to Anderson's policies and is said to have made threatening references to him in his speeches.\n\nWhile killings are not new to the Second Klan it is rare for them to successfully target such a high-ranking and beloved official and unsurprisingly there are demands to investigate the group despite Hiram Wesley Evans and William Joseph Simmons denying any connection to the killing and downplaying the Royal Riders involvement with the National White League. While the most militaristic White Leaguers support the act, in Washington State itself this violence has backfired, with many turning out to the state capital to mourn the loss of Anderson and to support his memory as a fair-minded man."
ustates.30010.a: "Hit the Red Riders"
ustates.30010.b: "Hit the Klan"
ustates.30010.c: "Their state government can handle this"

ustates.30011.t: "Fighting in Arkansas!"
ustates.30011.d: "The situation in Arkansas is deteriorating as the state government can not contain the increased fighting between the AFP Minutemen and the Old Democrat-aligned White Leagues, especially the Klan. Long's radically populist economic agenda and alliance with groups such as Jews and Catholics has incurred the hatred of both the more reactionary landed families in the region as well as supremacist groups despite his attempts to largely dodge (or when not possible regularly flipping on) the question of furthering civil rights for black Americans. As his ambitions put him at the odds with the Old Democratic Party and he seems more willing then they to make alliances with Progressives, competition between the AFP and ODP have broken down into outright warfare between the two, with Minutemen having recently attempted to assassinate local White League leader Homer Martin Adkins but only succeeding in wounding him. Long ally Hattie Wyatt Caraway is calling for support against the Klan's terror attacks claiming they are the main cause of the fighting whereas much of the established class on the Eastern side of Arkansas, including Congressman Ezekiel C. Gathings, desire a crackdown on the AFP. Traditional Democrat and former ally of Woodrow Wilson Joseph Robinson recommends a crackdown on both however."
ustates.30011.a: "Counter both"
ustates.30011.b: "Counter the Klan"
ustates.30011.c: "Counter the Minutemen"
ustates.30011.e: "We can't involve ourselves right now"

ustates.31.t: "Gone with the Wind"
ustates.31.d: "Margaret Mitchell published today her novel, 'Gone with the Wind', which immediately became a bestseller, and may be nominated for the next Pulitzer Prize. Even Hollywood is taking notice, and is planning a film adaptation to be released next year. Set in the Old South during the American Civil War, many see it as an analogy for the strained political situation in the United States; many conservative Southerners claim the novel supports their cause."
ustates.31.a: "Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."

ustates.32.t: "The Great Heat Wave of '36"
ustates.32.d: "A heat wave has struck the continental United States and Canada. The most severe heat wave in the modern history of North America, 'The Great Heat Wave' started in late June and went up over 100°F (38°C) as drought conditions worsened due to a continued lack of rain. Now, in July, the heat has reached all-time records. In Steele, North Dakota, temperatures have reached 121°F (50°C). In Ohio, temperatures have reached 110°F (43°C), which was close to tying a record high set in 1934.\n\nThis comes in a time of major political unrest, with the America First Council a major force in Midwest Politics, and Socialist and Syndicalist forces gathering strength in the Great Lakes region. The drought is continuing, and over 3,000 reported deaths have been linked to it. Many people are suffering from heat stroke and heat exhaustion. Farmers across the continent saw their worst harvest on record, causing corn and wheat prices to skyrocket, and this heat wave does not seem to be giving up any time soon."
ustates.32.a: "This just isn't our year..."

ustates.33.t: "The Great Heat Wave is over"
ustates.33.d: "People from Vancouver and Los Angeles to New York and Washington D.C. let out a sigh of relief as The Great Heat Wave of 1936 has come to an end, and now a cold front has spread over North America. It will come to be known as the United States' deadliest natural disaster of the 20th century, with an estimated death toll reaching 5,000. But even as the heat wave ends, a new chapter in American history is about to begin..."
ustates.33.a: "At least it's over..."

ustates.3300.t: "Campaigning Hardens Militia Lines"
ustates.3300.d: "The Campaigning Between Huey Long's AFP, the SPA and the ODP has grown so volatile that none apparently dare to campaign in the strongholds of the others. AFP Minutemen have begun actually patrolling the borders of hostile states with the collaboration of governors in order to dissuade them from attacking, with the ODP and SPA returning the favor. This is virtually the end of the new parties militias operating from the shadows, with them no longer being afraid to behave as a military force would and some of our own officers aiding them in their training, organization and patrolling, making them into a more cohesive force."
ustates.3300.a: "War may be coming"

ustates.3301.t: "A. Mitchell Palmer Dies"
ustates.3301.d: "Former President A. Mitchell Palmer died of heart complications today shortly after receiving an appendectomy. While the establishment parties (namely the Republicans and Democrats) gave statements expressing grief for his death the other parties, and much of the public, seem to be ambivalent about his death and are not issuing any statements at all. The SPA stands alone in practically openly celebrating his death, stating that Palmer was a tyrant whose two term presidency after taking over for Woodrow Wilson was responsible for American's current state and the attacks on union workers. The ODP appear to approve of Palmer's Red Scare and have issued a statement thanking him for his efforts although they repudiated his more liberal statements. Long himself barely commented, only stating that Palmer was a 'flawed' man."
ustates.3301.a: "Very Well"

ustates.3302.t: "The 1936 World Series"
ustates.3302.d: "On a chilly evening in New York, President Herbert Hoover has thrown out the ceremonial first pitch of the World Series in an all-New York, 'Subway Series' matchup between the National League champion Giants and the American League champion Yankees. While the series looks to be a competitive one, the Yankees are still highly favored to win, as the Yankees' old core of Lou Gehrig and Tony Lazzeri has been supplemented by rookie sensation Joe DiMaggio and pitching legend Lefty Gomez. The Giants are no pushover, however, having stars in home run king Mel Ott and ace pitcher Carl Hubbell. Due to the deteriorating political and economic situation, Americans have turned to baseball as one of the few things that can still bring people of all creeds together as one. At least for a few hours, America can feel normal once more."
ustates.3302.a: "Play ball!"

ustates.3303.t: "Yankees Win the World Series"
ustates.3303.d: "In what turned out to be a hard-fought series, the New York Yankees have defeated the Giants four games to two to earn their fifth championship. Many point to the turning point as being Yankees rookie Joe DiMaggio, who made a tremendous catch 490 feet out from home plate, running up the steps of the clubhouse for the final out and receiving a salute from president Hoover himself. Despite the game being decided by that point, his effort is to be commended. However, now that the World Series is over, many Americans are beginning to become increasingly divided as the election draws nearer and campaigning grows fiercer."
ustates.3303.a: "Congratulations, Yankees!"

ustates.3304.t: "Giants Win the World Series"
ustates.3304.d: "In a shocking upset, the New York Giants have defeated the Yankees four games to three to earn their fifth championship. While the Yankees put up a good fight, they simply could not handle the power of Mel Ott, who hit two home runs in the decisive game seven at the Polo Grounds. President Hoover himself saluted Ott for his stellar performance, whose longtime accomplishments have transformed the Giants into one of the best teams of the decade. However, now that the World Series is over, many Americans are beginning to become increasingly divided as the election draws nearer and campaigning grows fiercer."

ustates.3305.d.yankees_36: "On a day that many people a year ago never thought would come, the 1937 World Series has finally kicked off, with the Yankees and Giants meeting yet again for another all-New York matchup. While the Yankees have been playing great baseball all season and are looking to repeat their championship from last year, the Giants are eager for a rematch of last year's contest and have proven themselves to be a formidable opponent. The baseball itself has taken a backseat, however, as the Series proves to be one of the first true unifying events after the divisive Crisis of 1936 which nearly pitted many Americans to turn brother against brother. Many are hoping that this Series will only be the first of many events that will help heal the wounds of a divided America."

Joe DiMaggio, who returned to form almost immediately after the conclusion of the war, has had a breakout year, hitting safely in an unprecedented 56 consecutive games- a record unlikely to ever be broken. Even as the Dodgers are coming into this series the clear underdog, many Brooklyn fans are believing they can pull it off. Across the country, Americans have been listening to the radio anxiously to find out the winner in a small bit of respite from the chaos of rebuilding and as a much-needed moment of national unity."

Much of their success was due to recent acquisition Joe Medwick from St. Louis, who out-hit DiMaggio throughout the entire series. A close call occurred in game four, when Dodgers catcher Mickey Owen nearly made an error that cost them the game but the Dodgers recovered one play later, ending the game and securing momentum for the eventual Brooklyn victory. At the conclusion of the series, Medwick dedicated the victory to all of those who lost their lives in the war, serving as a sobering reminder on an otherwise bright day."

DiMaggio, one of the few major leaguers that returned to pre-war form this season, was dominant as always, but the real turning point came in game four when Dodgers catcher Mickey Owen flubbed an easy out that cost them the game and swung the momentum of the remainder of the Series the way of the Yankees. At the conclusion of the series, DiMaggio dedicated the victory to all of those who lost their lives in the war, serving as a sobering reminder on an otherwise bright day."
ustates.3310.a: "Here's to you, Joe DiMaggio, our nation turns its lonely eyes to you."


### the 1936 elections ###

ustates.34.t: "The 1936 Presidential Election"
ustates.34.d: "The results are finally in from what has probably been the most ideologically contested Presidential Election the United States has ever witnessed. None of the three major parties have secured enough votes in the Electoral College to outright win the presidency, and as a result, the House of Representatives once again has to vote on the winner of the election. While many are expecting the so-called "Mainstream Parties" to back one another the Old Democrats are attempting to court conservatives while the SPA demands progressives back them or be held responsible for a 'reactionary' victory. Meanwhile Long is seemingly attempting to cut a deal with every representative in arms reach, especially the Progressive Party, left-wing of the GOP and more populist Democrats. This is probably not the end of our problems, but for the time being, victory goes to..."

ustates.34.i: " Herbert Hoover (Republican)"

ustates.35.t: "Deadlocked Election!"
ustates.35.d: "The election remains deadlocked as the House of Representatives fails to appoint any candidate to the Presidency. With the uncertainty of the outcome lingering on paramilitaries are rioting in the streets and demanding their candidate be selected. Fearful, a grouping of D.C. powerbrokers among industrial leaders, lobbyists and sectors of the Establishment parties have backed the idea of MacArthur being appointed as chief executive so that he may follow through on his promises to end radicalism, using whatever backing he can receive in the House to give him needed political cover. While we could attempt to forestall this coup it's fairly obvious that MacArthur's wing of the military is preparing to accept the offer and may have instigated the entire arrangement. With even some of Hoover's cabinet pushing him to accept, Hoover's closest advisors state that he should flee across the Atlantic if he will not back MacArthur to avoid possible retribution or have the GOP back a different candidate if such an option still exists."
ustates.35.a: "Hoover backs MacArthur"
ustates.35.b: "We must evacuate"
ustates.35.c: "Back Garner"
ustates.35.e: "Back Norris"

ustates.36.t: "SPA Contest Election Results!"
ustates.36.d: "Members of the Socialist Party of America have refused to accept the results of our free and fair election, claiming that the House of Representatives system has subverted the will of the majority. Bill Haywood has said as much, and called the whole of Congress reactionary for this injustice. Independent newspapers from inside the SPA have reported that the AFL are beginning to show cracks in their solidarity with Haywood. "
ustates.36.a: "Damn Haywood!"

ustates.3600.t: "Long proclaims defense of 'Americanism'"
ustates.3600.d.reed: "Long has announced that while the AFP lost the election the SPA can not expect to get their agenda through Congress without his support and proclaims that he will vote in favor of those policies that favor "the American people" and against those that don't. It is clear he wishes to become Kingmaker in our divided congress and views the election of an anti-establishment party as his opening. The SPA are clearly irritated by this."
ustates.3600.d.Murray: "Long has announced that while the AFP lost the election the Old Democrats can not expect to get their agenda through Congress without his support and proclaims that he will vote in favor of those policies that favor "the American people" and against those that don't. It is clear he wishes to become Kingmaker in our divided congress and views the election of an anti-establishment party as his opening. The Old Democrats fervently hate Long for his opposition to 'old money' and his local battle for power with the Klan despite him attempting to keep this quiet."
ustates.3600.a: "Bastard"

ustates.37.t: "Old Democrats denounce SPA!"
ustates.37.d: "The Old Democrats have contested the results of the election. They claim that Haywood's allies have rigged the election and demanded a recount. William H. Murray even gave a mocking speech accepting the Presidency to his followers. Some murmurs from inside the Old Democrats have reported that the Republicans and Democrats that left for the Old Democrats have expressed regret for losing this historic election."
ustates.37.a: "What a loon."

ustates.3701.t: "Old Democrats denounce Garner!"
ustates.3701.d: "The Old Democrats have contested the results of the election. They claim that Garner and his congressional allies have rigged the election and demanded a recount. Even worse, they have denounced the outcome of the deadlock as horrific and demand a different result. William H. Murray even gave a mocking speech accepting the Presidency to his followers. Some murmurs from inside the Old Democrats have reported that the Republicans and Democrats that left for the Old Democrats have expressed regret for losing this historic election."
ustates.3701.a: "What a loon."

ustates.38.t: "Hoover Criticizes the President"
ustates.38.d.reed: "Herbert Hoover has been vocal after the election and openly criticized Haywood and the SPA as being unfit to lead the country. Hoover has encouraged both the Republicans and Democrats to form an alliance to curb Haywood and the SPA."
ustates.38.d.long: "Herbert Hoover has been vocal after the election and openly criticized Long and the America First as being a dangerous choice for the country. Hoover has encouraged both the Republicans and Democrats to form an alliance to keep Long in check."
ustates.38.d.murray: "Herbert Hoover has been vocal after the election and openly criticized Murray and the Old Democrats as being a dangerous and divisive choice for the country. Hoover has encouraged both the Republicans and Democrats to form an alliance to keep Long in check."

ustates.39.t: "President Hoover Supports New President"
ustates.39.d: "Herbert Hoover broke personal political lines to throw his support behind the incoming president, [USA.GetLeader]. Hoover stated that only adherence to the word of the law could bring the country together in these tough times. [USA.GetLeader] in turn has thanked Hoover for his service to his country."
ustates.39.a: "His support is appreciated."

ustates.39.d.herb: "Herbert Hoover announced to a nation engulfed in chaos that he will take his administration in a new direction. Hopeing with the help of both the Congress and the Local Governments in solving this crisis. Hoover is hoping this new direction will save the United States from a total collapse."
ustates.39.a.herb: "This is President Hoover, and you're listening to a Public Radio announcement"

ustates.40.t: "The New Year’s Day Strike"
ustates.40.d: "In protest of the election results, the SPA has launched a strike on New Year’s Day which has crippled the industries of the north. Councils of Trade Unions and Councils of Professional Workers have been set up to run the cities of the Steel Belt during the strike. The Hearst newspapers have demonized this to be similar to the general strike that set off the British Revolution."
ustates.40.a: "This is going to cause a problem."

### Haywood as President ###
ustates.41.t: "President Haywood's Inaugural Address"
ustates.41.d: "The country's social problems have forced the American people to turn to radical solutions; the two-party system has broken down, and Bill Haywood is to be sworn in as the 31st president of the United States with Jack Reed being sworn in as the Vice President. In a stirring speech in Washington DC, Haywood has pledged to defend the interests of the workers and work to help revolutionize society for the good of all Americans. However, the SPA's slim majority in Congress means that it may find it challenging to pass meaningful legislation, especially in the Senate, where the AFP has promised to filibuster any law it sees as detrimental to America."
ustates.41.a: "Let the People rejoice!"

ustates.42.t: "Executive Order 7080: Labor Unions"
ustates.42.d: "One of Haywood's first acts as president to enshrine the rights to collectively bargain in law. Unwilling to wait to overcome the Senate filibuster, and citing the violent conflict between reactionary and SPA paramilitaries, Haywood passed an executive order that forced state and federal governments to recognize a union's right to exist and engage in collective bargaining, without exception, thus forbidding Yellow Dog contracts. While the unions rejoice, many in the country denounce the executive order as a tyrannical act of the Executive Branch."
ustates.42.a: "For The Union Makes Us Strong!"

ustates.43.t: "Fury of Reaction"
ustates.43.d: "From New York to San Francisco, their are protests of Haywood's election in the Hearst newspapers and in Congressional addresses, with Long strongly criticizing him for not making it conditional for radical unions to end the strikes and stop growing the Red Guard, saying Haywood was actively rewarding radicalism. However his strongest foes are amongst the Old Democrats and their paramilitary affiliates. It is clear that they are furious at the enforcement of Executive Order 7080 as they view it as a reward to radical unions that are destroying the nation and have begun to radicalize against the SPA as a result."
ustates.43.a: "Let reactionaries shout"

ustates.44.t: "Opposition Denounces Haywood as Tyrant"
ustates.44.d: "Though they agree on little else, the Democrats, Republicans, Old Democrats and the America First Parties have been quick to denounce Haywood publicly across the nation for the enactment of Executive Order 7080, claiming that it to be an overreach of the Executive Branch, and the start of the slide into tyranny. Old Democrat John E. Rankin has gone so far as to have vowed to not follow any law that 'Dictator Haywood' imposes upon America. Rankin followed up by comparing President Haywood to Vladimir Lenin, gloating that Haywood would share Lenin's fate."
ustates.44.a: "Rankins cause is the one that's finished"

ustates.45.t: "Executive Order 7089: Halt on Foreclosure"
ustates.45.d: "Directing the Secretary of Commerce to Temporarily Take Possession of and Operate the Facilities of Certain Financial Companies\n\nThe inability to deal with the Great Depression had been the death of two major parties, and it would be the death of the SPA as well, unless Haywood acted quickly and decisively. Believing that the corrupt financial sector was primarily responsible for creating and prolonging the Depression in order to discredit syndicalism and the worker needs further empowerment Haywood has moved to nationalize the banks of Wall Street to force them to act in the public, rather than the private, good. This includes stopping banks from foreclosing on bankrupt homeowners. A filibuster by Senator Bricker has forced Haywood to resort to an Executive Order, appealing to the public good and claiming the control capital has over Congress is too great to overcome otherwise. While popular with much of the lower class and the radical sections of the working class, others claim Haywood is drunk on his power and well on his way to declare himself a dictator."
ustates.45.a: "The workers are saved!"

ustates.46.t: "Standard Oil Strikes Back!"
ustates.46.d: "The Supreme Court has allowed the first challenge to Executive Order 7100, Standard Oil of California vs. Paul Mattick, to be heard. This case is brought by Paul Mattick to argue that Standard Oil's monopolistic power has overtaken democratic power. The accusation of Standard Oil bribing the Boston City Council is being taken very seriously. The nation waits to see if Haywood's power will be checked, or whether the SPA will continue to enact their agenda in defiance of the Senate."
ustates.46.a: "Damn Reactionaries"

ustates.47.t: "Executive Order 7100: Nationalize Minerals"
ustates.47.d: "Directing the Secretary of the Interior to Temporarily Take Possession of and Operate the Facilities of Certain Mining Companies\n\nThe belief that public land is a public good is essential to most left-leaning parties, and the flagrant abuse of public land by mining companies had long been a source of deep bitterness for the transcendantalists. To most of Haywood's cabinet, it was clear that private mining companies would be entirely unable to balance the needs of the public with their greed and that they would favor the imperialist powers in the coming wars, and therefor have moved to kill two birds with one stone by nationalizing the drilling and mining companies, included Standard Oil. This has been seen by many as an attack against a political rival, and further confirmation that Haywood wishes to turn America into a syndicalist state like the Commune of France or the Union of Britain."
ustates.47.a: "America's Resources belong to the People!"

ustates.48.t: "Red Executive Agreement"
ustates.48.d: "Bill Haywood has entered into an executive agreement with the Commune of France to the outrage of Congress, promising them military supplies for their endeavour against Germany. Many are viewing this as an overuse of his powers but as their are few precedents for this there is little to stop him in the short-term. SPA opponents view this as nothing short of using taxpayer dollars to fund revolution and are already threatening to revolt."
ustates.48.a: "The Revolution is inevitable"
ustates.48.b: "Give them more than we agreed to"

ustates.4800.t: "The Steel Belt fortified"
ustates.4800.d: "As we prepare to protect the working class from backlash to our acts in the form of right-wing paramilitaries or private strikebreakers, the Steel Belt will need a substantial investment, with the revoltionary committee desiring forts at stronghold locations to deter Congress from getting any ideas about removing Haywood and uprooting the Steel Belt by force."
ustates.4800.a: "Land Forts in the cities"
ustates.4800.b: "Land Forts on the borders"

ustates.4801.t: "Butler recommends moving armaments"
ustates.4801.d: "A member of the revolutionary committee and our top military man in the SPA, Smedley Butler has warned us that the loyalties of those in Congress is tenuous and that it is not safe for us to keep so many arms here, recommending we move them into our strongholds to further deter potential sabotage."
ustates.4801.a: "Very well"

ustates.4802.t: "Hit the AFP?"
ustates.4802.d: "A longtime adversary of the cause, Huey Long's Minutemen have gotten in plenty of brawls with our men in the past but nonetheless have often been more focused on the ODP and Long has been slightly more middling about Haywood's executive acts than many others, chastizing him for his anti-capitalism as 'un-American' but admitting that that the policy in particular is an improvement over what came before. As such the Revolutionary Committee is unsure about what to do with him, with the more hardline radicals like William Z. Foster and Eugene Dennis wanting to hit him as well and relative moderates such as Butler thinking we should not antagonize him and instead focus on the Establishment and ODP."
ustates.4802.a: "Strike the Minutemen as well"
ustates.4802.b: "Leave them alone for now"

ustates.4803.t: "Denounced by Congress"
ustates.4803.d: "Many Congressmen are feeling the heat at the hands of the revolutionary committee that is investigating their connections to capital, spreading pro-SPA propaganda and undermining their political base. They view our recent build-up of arms as an obvious sign that we are preparing to arm radicalized workers to overrun the country and have finally had enough in Haywood's short-time as president with several Congressmen holding a vote to impeach Haywood for Treason, betraying the US to the Internationale cause, while other Congressmen are apparently contacting members of the military for aid."
ustates.4803.a: "Capital finally raises its iron fist"

ustates.49.t: "Violence Against the SPA Spreads"
ustates.49.d: "In the immediate aftermath of Haywood's nationalizations, Murray has come out aggressively against Haywood, all but calling for an armed uprising. Whole counties and states, especially in the south, are refusing to accept Haywood's Executive Orders as law, and there has been a massive increase in reported violent clashes between the Minutemen, Klan and SPA militia. Unless order is restored, the country is bound for a civil war."
ustates.49.a: "The police should be helping the people!"

ustates.4900.t: "ODP Walks Out"
ustates.4900.d: "The ODP in Congress utterly denounced Haywood for his actions against the ODP and crackdowns on their activities, refusing to stand for it and claiming that they are now the last line of defense against syndicalism. Refusing to legitimize federal authority they view as subverted by leftism, they have stormed out of Congress to return to their home states, confident they can handle the issue through other means."
ustates.4900.a: "Let them leave!"

ustates.50.t: "Clashes Between National Klan and Police"
ustates.50.d: "The Old Democrats calls for a resistance against Haywood have been interpreted by some as a call for resistance against any governmental agency. Police clashes with the White Leaguers have now become common throughout the country. In cities with strong SPA presence, members of the General Defense Committees helped the police restore law and order, but in the Deep South, the Old Democrat paramilitaries effectively have complete control."
ustates.50.a: "Somebody Stop Them!"

ustates.51.t: "MacArthur Marches onto Washington"
ustates.51.d: "Haywood's support in D.C has finally bottomed out. General Douglas MacArthur has marched into Washington D.C today, to arrest Haywood and his cabinet at the White House. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the status quo, and were cheered instead of booed. Having been tipped off by SPA informants in MacArthur's command staff, Haywood was able to stay ahead of the traitorous general and has escaped to Chicago. MacArthur has chosen to inhabit the White House and coordinate an investigation into Haywood from the executive chair. Civil war is imminent."
ustates.51.a: "My allegiance was to the Republic, MacArthur, to democracy!"

### President Long ###

ustates.52.t: "Long's Inaugural Address"
ustates.52.d: "The country's social problems have forced the American people to turn to radical solutions; the two-party system has broken down, and Huey P. Long is to be sworn in as the 31st president of the United States with William Lemke being sworn in as the Vice President with the support of progressives giving him just enough support to take Congress. In a stirring speech in Washington DC, Long has pledged to defend the interest of the people and to put the interest of the regular American above anyone else. However, the AFP's slim coalition in Congress means that it may find it challenging to pass meaningful legislation, especially in the senate where an assortment of Old Democratic, Republican, Democratic and SPA senators have promised to filibuster any law they see as detrimental to America."
ustates.52.a: "God Bless America."

ustates.53.t: "Executive Order 7037: Farm Aid Bill"
ustates.53.d: "One of Long's first acts is to provide relief for the farmers of America, thus this executive order directed the Secretary of Commerce. The order enforces price controls on farm products, provides credit to the farmers and provide tariffs on grains and other cereals. This will reverse the price slump that is driving farmers into poverty. Unwilling to wait to overcome the Senate filibuster, and citing the violent conflict that is going on in America, Long passed the executive order bypassing Congress entirely. While farmers across the country rejoice, the mainstream parties in the country denounce the Executive Order as a tyrannical act of the Executive Branch and a cynical attempt to grab the ODP's support base."
ustates.53.a: "Approved"

ustates.54.t: "Assembling the Cabinet"
ustates.54.d: "Huey Long intends to follow through on this promises to build a cross-party alliance that will allow for the dominance in his Share the Wealth ideology in America and build enough congressional support to pass the AFP's agenda. However, attempting to appoint everyone from 'moderate' Socialists to conservative Democrats to his cabinet has proved a problem as some are flatly refusing to join, with some leftists being especially upset at the idea of Herbert Hoover being appointed Secretary of Commerce and rightists disliking Smedley Butler being appointed Secretary of War. Of course Charles Coughlin presses us to just double down on AFP appointees and only appoint other parties who will accept this. If we don't take his advice it's obvious that we would have to bias one side of the aisle to get them to agree."
ustates.54.a: "Lean Towards Conservative Appointees"
ustates.54.b: "We only need the AFP"
ustates.54.c: "Lean Towards Socialist Appointees"

ustates.5400.t: "Masters of Finance decline Share Our Wealth!"
ustates.5400.d: "Publicly, Long stated he had hoped that the Morgan Banking family, Rockefellers and other financial elites could be talked into supporting Share Our Wealth if they were brought to the table and told it was only defense the nation had, allowing them to be administrators if they accepted mass wealth redistribution. Unsurprisingly however, one after another has turned down his offer, with Rockefeller calling him a 'fool'. While some relatively 'small-time' millionares seem open to the plan it is clear the giants are not, causing (or perhaps just allowing) Long to go on the offensive, decrying their lack of patriotism."
ustates.5400.a: "How could they?!"

ustates.5401.t: "Trust Busting!"
ustates.5401.d: "Long has ordered the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division to investigate all of the powers that declined Share Our Wealth, and has signed an executive order expanding the definition of trusts. This combination has led to outcries in Congress of authoritarianism, while Long attempts to deal with this by calling congressmen who oppose him tools of big business. His popularity among the common people has fanatically increased as a result but Washington obviously remains opposed, calling it unconstitutional and a wild overreach of his powers, while the more radical of his opponents promise to use their paramilitaries to defend themselves from Long."
ustates.5401.a: "As it should!"

ustates.5402.t: "The Long Order!"
ustates.5402.d: "Long has declared that all attempts to talk to or frighten the financial elite to be a failure and has issued an executive order that will implement a one-time confiscation of wealth above $$50 million dollars, declaring that the amount of capital these self-serving businessmen is wildly irresponsible, a threat to the Republic and makes it impossible to pass any legislation through Congress. Naturally Congress is in an uproar and has denounced the action as the latest in a series of self-serving AFP acts, though the unaffiliated populace appear to be with Long. It is unknown how much this will help as segments of the military are apparently coordinating with members of Congress to take action against Congress."
ustates.5402.a: "It was the only way!"

ustates.55.t: "Coughlin-Banking Bill Debate"
ustates.55.d: "The Coughlin-Banking Bill is starting a massive fight in Congress, with its goal to establish a Central Bank being fanatically opposed by the ODP and its near-nationalization of private banking by only allowing them to administrate it being opposed by most parties with the exception of the Progressive Party and, in part, the SPA. As the debate drags on Long is increasingly being accused of attempting to shove through the policy on his own terms and of wanting a centralized, tyrannical government, with AFP opponents believing that to hand the AFP control of banking would be handing them the nation despite Long's insistence that the bank directors will be democratically elected. Thankfully however it seems many Americans, especially those in AFP territory, are supportive of the plan and view it as a vindication of the AFP's presentation of Long as a man of the people."
ustates.55.a: "The common people are wiser!"

ustates.56.t: "AFP Machine Growth"
ustates.56.d: "Long has decided to pass the Banking Bill in the most reliable manner he knows how: by playing political games against Washington. Long has used the bully pulpit to decry Congress as corrupt to the bone, calling Sentators by name (to their outrage) and reports have been circulated of increasing bribes to politicians, the gathering of blackmail material, demanding recall elections against opponents in their territory and declaring the Minuteman will receive federal backing as they are 'defenders of democracy'."
ustates.56.a: "Sharing our wealth is our only defense!"

ustates.57.t: "ODP retreats South"
ustates.57.d: "The ODP has had enough of trying to deal with the growing Long Machine that is undermining their influence, with Theodore Bilbo declaring that they intend to defend their representation by any means neccessary. NDWL members have attacked Minutemen in ODP territory and the ODP has overturned all attempts at recall eleciton in their territory. Of course, their ongoing opposition to the banking plan has increased Long's popularity and harmed their own."
ustates.57.a: "Bastards!"

ustates.58.t: "The Long investigation!"
ustates.58.d: "Long has stated that it is obvious those bankers who oppose his plan have made their interests quite clear, and he has stated he will investigate them to the full effect of the law for any un-American corruption they have engaged in. Long has lumped in Standard Oil with these major financial forces, and has stated that he will have any congressmen involved in corrupt dealings with John D. Rockefeller to be arrested and tried by a civilian jury. Naturally major players in Washington are not taking this well, as the investigations are damaging their reputation."
ustates.58.a: "I shall defend the interests of the nation"

ustates.59.t: "Long Demands Order!"
ustates.59.d: "Citing national concerns due to the anarchistic nature of the Socialist Party of America and their Red Guards as well as the continuing economic depression as a result of worker strikes, Huey Long has declared his intention to restore order to the Steel Belt by force if necessary. He has told the Red Guard to stand down so that the government can negotiate an acceptable deal with unions for their payment without the influence of syndicalist radicalism. Naturally the SPA is furious and believe this is further evidence that Long is little more than a reactionary showman."
ustates.59.a: "It's the only way!"

ustates.60.t: "SPA filibusters Congress!"
ustates.60.d: "The SPA have declared their intention to oppose Long's decision to end radicalism through any means available to them, starting with nonstop filibusters in Congress to ensure no legislation passes until he agrees to pull back his forces. Denouncing him as a tyrant and social imperialist capitalist in the papers, it is clear the squeeze on them is hurting them."
ustates.60.a: "So be it"

ustates.61.t: "Red Guard Barricades Steel Belt"
ustates.61.d: "The Red Guard, with support from governors loaning them National Guardsmen, have begun barricading the streets of cities such as Detroit, Chicago and Philadelphia 'to protect the working class from the forces of faux-populist reactionary capitalism' in the words of SPA leader Bill Haywood. As such we are combining the Minutemen with the national guard to take back the cities but the military is upset that Long shoved through his program without consulting him and the ODP is using the opportunity to take pot shots at the SPA and build themselves up without allying Long, seemingly hoping the two will wear each other down."
ustates.61.a: "So be it"

ustates.62.t: "The Minutemen clash with the SPA"
ustates.62.d: "When the Minutemen arrived in the Steel Belt to enforce the laws of the President, they were immediately set upon by members of the SPA and its supporters. Shoot-outs quickly became commonplace, and the violence quickly spread throughout almost every major city in the Steel Belt. It has quickly noticed that the government has no remaining authority within the Steel Belt."
ustates.62.a: "Send in the biggest guys we've got"

ustates.6200.t: "NDWL Declares Long a traitor!"
ustates.6200.d: "The National Democratic White League (NDWL) has denounced Long's declaration against the White League and National Klan, with their violent competition for an overlapping voterbase and anger against Long's policies and alliances finally coming to a head. Calling Long a syndicalist in all but name and a demagogue Hiram Wesley Evans has called Long a traitor to the national cause and NDWL leaders have gone underground in their respective states. There is no doubt they are taking a beating however."
ustates.6200.a: "Send in the biggest guys we've got"

ustates.6201.t: "The Minutemen battle the Old Democrats"
ustates.6201.d: "When the Minutemen arrived in the Mason-Dixie to enforce the laws of the President, they were immediately set upon by members of the Old Democrats and its supporters, whom have started a violent insurrection campaign. Shoot-outs quickly became commonplace, and the violence quickly spread throughout almost every major city in the both the Deep South and parts of the North controlled by the Klan. It has quickly noticed that the government has no remaining authority within parts of the South and Mid-East."
ustates.6201.a: "Send in the biggest guys we've got"

ustates.63.t: "MacArthur and the Army Remove Long"
ustates.63.d: "Long's support in D.C has finally bottomed out. Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today to restore order, having declared Long to be a tyrant and attempted to arrest him at the White House. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the status quo, and were cheered instead of booed. Having been tipped off by AFP informants in MacArthur's command staff, Long was able to stay ahead of the traitorous general and has escaped to New Orleans. MacArthur has chosen to inhabit the White House and coordinate an investigation into Long from the executive chair. Civil war is imminent."
ustates.63.a: "My allegiance was to the Republic, MacArthur, to democracy!"

### President Murray ###

ustates.6300.t: "Murray's Inaugural Address"
ustates.6300.d: "The country's social problems have forced the American people to turn to radical solutions; the two-party system has broken down, and William H. Murray is to be sworn in as the 31st president of the United States with John E. Rankin being sworn in as the Vice President with the support of Conservative Democrats and the right-wing "fringe" of the Republican Party giving him just enough support to take Congress. In a stirring speech in Washington DC, Murray has pledged to defend the interest of the American people and to destroy those who would threaten them. Naturally this has outraged the SPA and the ODP's slim coalition in Congress means that it may find it challenging to pass meaningful legislation, especially in the senate where an assortment of Democratic, Republican, Progressive and of course SPA senators have promised to filibuster any law they see as detrimental to America."
ustates.6300.a: "God Bless America."

ustates.6301.t: "Haywood and Long reinforce militias!"
ustates.6301.d: "In response to Murray's inauguration both Bill Haywood and Huey Long have doubled down on reinforcing their respective militias, seemingly dropping any pretense of not offically being their leaders. Condemning Murray as a threat to democracy, Long demands he stay clear of AFP territory while Haywood all but promises future conflict."
ustates.6301.a: "Traitors!"

ustates.6302.t: "Bankers Resist!"
ustates.6302.d: "As the establishment class resists our bill to break up banks and have those in ODP territory controlled by the states, it becomes clear we can not pass our desired legislation through Congress and executive orders will have to suffice. On the plus side, Murray's anti-bank activities has increased his popularity with the common people."
ustates.6302.a: "Fools"

ustates.6303.t: "Penalizing the corrupt"
ustates.6303.d: "It is obvious that the bankers and lobbyists have to much influence in DC, often working for the good of their own pockets than the people. As such Murray has announced he shall dig through every corrupter working against the ODP to find the crimes they have committed and prosecute them whenever possible. Of course, this announcement has set off a firestorm of hatred among the other parties but will weaken the corrupt establishment."
ustates.6303.a: "Good!"

ustates.6304.t: "Rockefeller Investigated!"
ustates.6304.d: "The Oil Tycoon John D. Rockefeller has aligned himself with Republican politics and greed for too long, and now he is paying the price of putting profit among national brotherhood. Employees of Rankin and Ford have found evidence of price-fixing and undercutting competitors. Despite the outcries of his agents is time to announce we intend to put him on trial, and every congressman who has connections to him."
ustates.6304.a: "Good!"

ustates.6306.t: "Smith Act Blocked!"
ustates.6306.d: "The Smith Act would simultaneously end non-white and non-protestant immigration to the United States while reintroducing forms of segregation to the North, including banning Whites from marrying Jews and those with more a quarter of black blood. However the act has virtually no chance of passing Congress as basically only ODP congressmen and a handful of breakaways from other parties are willing to vote for it. As such an executive order will need to be enacted."
ustates.6306.a: "They forced our hand!"

ustates.6307.t: "Congress Protests!"
ustates.6307.d: "Congress is openly protesting our most recent executive accusing Murray of being an extremist demagogue. Already the AFP and SPA are mobilizing against us and the Establishment appears to be making negotiations with the military to restrain Murray. It appears as though we are being literally forced from office in short time although our executive acts has made us even more popular among those who leaned towards us."
ustates.6307.a: "Traitors!"

ustates.6308.t: "MacArthur forces out Murray"
ustates.6308.d: "William H. Murray's time is up as he has fled for the ODP controlled Georgia after hearing of MacArthur's clique planning to coup him. MacArthur has announced that Murray and all other radicals threatening America will have to stand down and allow a return to ordinary democratic politics, basically demanding that all militias disband and accept the constitution."
ustates.6308.a: "This is the only way"

ustates.6309.t: "Hitting Long"
ustates.6309.d: "Huey Long's Minutemen have come under increasing attack in recent days, and the ODP is loudly denouncing the congressmen aligned with them. With our attempts to occupy the Midwest incuring the wrath of the AFP and resulting in guerilla attacks on ODP militants in turn, we have been more succesful in weeding out Share Our Wealth socieities in the deep South. The SPA have fought our attempts to bring troops into the Steel Belt to attack the AFP however out of paranoia that they are actually there to fight the Red Guard, or at least will be once we're done with Long. Long himself has left Congress for Louisiana and already Congress is upset as they view Murray as using federal forces to empower the ODP by stomping on his enemies, fully expecting him to come for them next."
ustates.6309.a: "That ought to teach him a lesson."

ustates.6310.t: "Hitting Haywood"
ustates.6310.d: "Our strikes on the Red Guard in the Steel Belt has been met with enthusiastic applause among the ODP, mixed reactions among the Democrats and of course total aversion by the SPA whom believe that we will soon be coming after them as well which is basically correct as we hold them to account for their attacks on America. While the SPA has taken a beating in the Steel Belt they are striking back as Red Guards resort to Guerilla warfare although we have eradicated the holdouts in the Southeast who were giving the ODP trouble. Most establishment members of Congress however view this as basically irresponsible and dangerous, with a widespread conspiracy theory amongst them that Murray is just using their forces against Haywood to cement the ODP's power before likely turning on them."
ustates.6310.a: "We'll break Haywood in short order"

ustates.6311.t: "The General Strike Spreads"
ustates.6311.d: "With the Red Guard slowly building strength against us and our insaction, the SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. Meanwhile Long's AFP has likewise been coordinating against us. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces, Old Democrats or even with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, and are calling for immediate government intervention. Soon war will be coming."
ustates.6311.a: "A disaster!"

### President Curtis/Landon ###

ustates.64.t: "Presidential Inauguration"
ustates.64.dc: "After his election, Curtis addressed the nation. Curtis called for patience and civility in these difficult times. Curtis was quoted as saying 'A nation cannot be preserved which does not preserve its citizens. Industry is reducing wages, lowering the standard of living, destroying buying power, this cannot be the way we solve our economic problems.' Reinvigorated with his unlikely victory, Curtis boldly strides into the White House amidst protests from both the socialists and hard liners with the promise of fixing the economy, restoring national brotherhood, and preventing political violence by any means necessary. Whether the rest of the nation would listen to the message was another story."
ustates.64.dl: "Alf Landon was sworn in as the 31st president of the United States of America today. At his inaugural address Landon spoke of the challenges facing the nation in preserving a liberal democacy. Landon was quoted as saying 'Republicans must become practical liberals, which means that the Republican party has got to recognize the problems of a growing and complex industrial civilization. And I think I will awaken America to that.' Landon concluded with a promise to solve the Depression with entrepreneurship. Creating a new generation of millionaires that will bring pride back to the nation. Whether anyone will listen is another matter."
ustates.64.dz: "Herbert Hoover was sworn in again as the president of the United States of America today. President Hoover Inauguration speech called for calm in these times of difficulty and how we must not compromise our democratic values with radicals, left or right. Hoover is quoted as saying "America is a great social and economic experiment, noble in motive and far-reaching in purpose.""
ustates.64.a: "America is One Nation Indivisible!"

ustates.65.t: "Republicans Announce Negotiations"
ustates.65.dc: "President Curtis has announced that his first priority as president is to end the most recent strike launched by the SPA, and that he has sent an invitation to sit down with Bill Haywood in Chicago to negotiate. Haywood holds a firm grip over both the IWW and AFL, whom make up the bulk of the general strikers. Our negotiators believe that Curtis's cabinet members are opposed to the talks, seeing any negotiation as political suicide - the coalition was formed, after all, in order to bypass having to directly deal with the SPA, but President Curtis is determined."
ustates.65.dl: "President Landon has announced that his first priority as president is to end the most recent strike launched by the SPA, and that he has sent an invitation to sit down with Bill Haywood in Chicago to negotiate. Haywood holds a firm grip over both the IWW and AFL, whom make up the bulk of the general strikers. Our negotiators believe that Landon's cabinet members are opposed to the talks, seeing any negotiation as political suicide - the coalition was formed, after all, in order to bypass having to directly deal with the SPA, but President Landon and his top negotiator, VP Charles Curtis, are determined."
ustates.65.a: "This is the only way"

ustates.66.t: "Haywood Accepts Invitation"
ustates.66.d: "Bill Haywood has sent word to the government that he has accepted the invitation to negotiate. An FBI intelligence file on Haywood indicates that he and other SPA leaders were worried that their right-wing would defect if he outright turned it down meaning he is less than thrilled to be present but must make at least a show of quasi-good will. While preparations are being made in Chicago to heighten security, members of the President's cabinet as well as General Douglas MacArthur have expressed their serious misgivings at the entire endeavour. They say he is putting his life in jeopardy, but for now they will wait to see what comes of the meeting."
ustates.66.a: "I survived a heart attack, I can handle this"
ustates.66.b: "Good, the Republic may survive after all"

ustates.67.t: "Negotiations Begin"
ustates.67.dc: "Curtis gave a stirring speech stating his plan before the negotiations. 'With these negotiations we continue the great American tradition of achieving peace through compromise, progress through understanding and democracy through mutual agreement. May our efforts today fulfill the spirit of the Constitution and preserve the liberty of all Americans.' President Curtis and Bill Haywood have sat down for their historic meeting in Chicago. Though mid-starting the negotiations word arrived that both Huey Long and (upon hearing of Long's request) William H. Murray have demanded to be at the negotiations despite our diplomats already telling them they would be seen after Haywood. Their presence will undoubtedly make negotiations more difficult, possibly scuttling them entirely, but refusing could incite the AFP and ODP to such a degree as to make success in Chicago worthless. Even Haywood himself seems to want them to be present if only to be certain that Curtis will tell them all the same thing without giving the others too much."
ustates.67.dl: "Landon gave a stirring speech stating his plan before the negotiations. 'Many are concerned that talking to ones adversies is a form of weakness. However, such thoughts are the domain of the fanatic who would see his people sacrificed to satisfy his foolishness. This is a great moment for liberty and step towards a freer America.' Though mid-starting the negotiations word arrived that both Huey Long and (upon hearing of Long's request) William H. Murray have demanded to be at the negotiations despite our diplomats already telling them they would be seen after Haywood. Their presence will undoubtedly make negotiations more difficult, possibly scuttling them entirely, but refusing could incite the AFP and ODP to such a degree as to make success in Chicago worthless. Even Haywood himself seems to want them to be present if only to be certain that Landon will tell them all the same thing and not give them too much."
ustates.67.a: "Allow them to participate"
ustates.67.b: "They have no business here"

ustates.68.t: "Desire for Autonomy"
ustates.68.d: "Haywood, Long and Murray have made it clear they believe the working man is being stiffed but have wildly different ways of achieving their goals. However, the Home Rule plans to allow each to implment their ideas in their respective regions. Haywood demands that we make a show of goodwill by ending all attempts to end the general strike, essentially pulling much of our forces out of the region. The AFP and ODP have stated that if we are to follow through on such a thing we will have to do the same for them and order MacArthur's military forces to stand down. Of course Haywood nearly blew up the negotations by stating that pulling forces away from ODP strongholds would simply make it easier for the Red Guard to eventually overrun them but it was a threat Murray simply chuckled at and invited him to try his best. After Long and the President reminded both men that the US Army remained the issue at hand they thankfully stopped their fighting for the moment."
ustates.68.a: "Very Well"
ustates.68.b: "Haywood needs to make a better offer"

ustates.69.t: "D.C. Denounced"
ustates.69.d: "With their rejection from the meeting, William H. Murray and Huey Long have both denounced President [USA.GETLeader] for meeting with an "anarchist" before them. Both are riling their supporters, with the AFP demanding for Long to be allowed into the meeting room and the ODP already declaring D.C. a corrupt establishment beyond salvation, caving into radicalism. Governors and Congressman from their respective factions are already nodding in agreement with these sentiments and are reportedly outright meeting with their respective militia leaders. Haywood, upon hearing this, has decided to return to the Steel Belt to organize the SPA, demanding that President [USA.GETLeader] put down both the ODP and AFP in the meantime if Curtis wants him to return. It's unlikely that such a thing is possible without Civil War, however."
ustates.69.a: "We have failed"

ustates.6900.t: "Haywood calls [USA.GETLeader] Corrupt"
ustates.6900.d.c: "Alf Landon's election material made him out to be a self-made man, an entrepreneur who made his wealth starting from a small petroleum company. Landon's relationship with the oil industry culminated in the establishment of the United States Oil and Gas Association in his home state of Kansas, which freely associates with Standard Oil. Now that he has attempted to close ranks with big business Haywood and the SPA view this as the smoking gun that Landon is a traitor to people. Though to many these accusations have rang hollow citing Landon as a man with the business connections attempting to improve the economy, the radicals seem convinced."
ustates.6900.d.l: "Alf Landon's election material made him out to be a self-made man, an entrepreneur who made his wealth starting from a small petroleum company.

Now that he has attempted to close ranks with big business Haywood and the SPA view this as the smoking gun that Landon is a traitor to people. Though to many these accusations have rang hollow citing Landon as a man with the business connections attempting to improve the economy, the radicals seem convinced."
ustates.6900.a: "He will destroy the Republic!"

ustates.6901.t: "Huey Long calls [USA.GETLeader] a Corporatist"
ustates.6901.d: "Huey Long has responded, like Haywood, by decrying [USA.GETLeader] as a corrupt politician in Standard Oil's pocket. While he supported negotiations as a step in the right direction he also recently spoke about how President [USA.GETLeader] only cared for the rich and the monopolies that oppress true Americans, articulating criticism of [USA.GETLeader]'s fiscal conservatism during his tenure as Governor of Kansas. Huey Long also made sure to remind the people that, by all rights, he should be president and that he would have fixed this crisis already. The President, meanwhile, responded in a recent interview with newspapers that Long has a serious case of 'sour grapes', and political cartoons have begun depicting Long as a childish baboon - much to the AFP's outrage."
ustates.6901.a: "Self-centered Buffoon!"

ustates.6902.t: "Murray Denounces Recent Policies"
ustates.6902.dl: "William H. Murray has responded to the President spreading anti-White League propaganda by decrying [USA.GETLeader] as a corrupt politician appealing to bureaucrats, corporations and minorities who is using his economic connections as a way to attack states rights via powerful corporate interests. Denouncing him as a Republican tool and race traitor, most national newspapers have denounced Murray with the exception of the outright sympathetic Fordist papers."
ustates.6902.dc: "William H. Murray has responded to the President's recent spreading of anti-White League propaganda by decrying Curtis as a corrupt politician appealing to bureaucrats, corporations and minorities whom is using his political connections as a way to attack states rights via powerful corporate interests. Denouncing him as a Republican tool and claiming that he is an embarrassment to his Cherokee heritage, most national newspapers have denounced Murray with the exception of the outright sympathetic Fordist papers."
ustates.6902.a: "What an ignorant madman!"

ustates.6903.t: "Murray Denounces Cronyism"
ustates.6903.d: "William H. Murray has responded to the President meeting with business leaders before political ones by decrying [USA.GETLeader] as a corrupt politician appealing to bankers, corporations and minorities who is using his economic connections as a way to attack states rights via powerful corporate interests. Most national newspapers have denounced Murray with the exception of the outright sympathetic Fordist papers and the more ambivalent Hearst Empire."
ustates.6903.a: "What an ignorant madman!"

ustates.70.t: "Funding Demanded"
ustates.70.d: "As the meeting in Chicago began in earnest, it quickly became clear that all of the men present had only one factor in common: to bring back something of benefit to their constituents. They have demanded that each of their parties be given a lump cash subsidy by the government for fighting the depression. While this will be a show of goodwill and they will all walkout if refused, it threatens to empower radicals should the negotations fail. And, of course, none of them will be happy to see the others getting funding, meaning we will have to concede more in the negotiations."
ustates.70.a: "Agree"
ustates.70.b: "Disagree"

ustates.71.t: "Murray's Demands"
ustates.71.d: "Despite having a reputation of being a 'fighter' known for making outrageous and offensive statements in public, Old Democrat leader William H. Murray is very clearly more shrewd in private. He has unsurprisingly fought tooth and nail to keep Long and Haywood from getting more power in their home regions but before they gave up on him he finally has an offer for everyone at the table. If the Socialists and AFP "pull out" from the Old Democrats regions and instead invite their most prominent supporters to live in their own regions, he will vote for increased autonomy. However, with this autonomy he wants Federal investigations into the White Leagues within the Mason-Dixie line reduced, calling this a 'local matter', and a public promise for the President to respect states rights. Finally, on top of all this, he wants a substantial investment into the rural South... by giving yet another large grant for Murray and the ODP to do with as they see fit. This would effectively ensure the Old Democrats rule from Indiana to Florida for the foreseeable future but it is the only hope for the Home Plan to work."
ustates.71.a: "Agree"
ustates.71.b: "Never!"

ustates.7100.t: "Radicals Upset!"
ustates.7100.d: "Haywood and his entourage are upset that we have agreed to Murray's demands to give the Old Democrats greater control of his region, viewing it as a betrayal of the workers whom have supported him in the region. Long on the other hand seems willing to agree so long as there is a 'ceasefire' between the two, meaning that Long will not work to expand his influence among the Old Democrats but will keep those party machines which already exist and will 'suggest' (as he 'officially' has no control over them) the Minutemen cease aggressive acts between them. AFL leader Samuel Gompers has been called into a meeting between the President and Haywood to delegate between the two and he came up with his own compromise. While the SPA will cease to encourage growth in the south they will be given even greater control of the North, a large grant to do what they wish with, protectionism shall stay the norm with the Entente and the federal Government will make no attempt to cease the so-called 'Combined Syndicates' from aiding the syndicalist movement in other parts of the world. Haywood has reluctantly agreed believing it will aid more workers in the long-run and, of course, it is likely he believes the Syndicalist Movement can liberate the American South once he can help it become the unipolar ideology of the world. The only question now is if the Republicans will agree. Of course Long has seen an opening to also demand that the AFP be compensated for going along with this deal with a larger grant which they can spend on their rural and unemployed supporters."
ustates.7100.a: "We agree"
ustates.7100.b: "That's a bit too much"

ustates.72.t: "Issue of the Militias"
ustates.72.d: "With all sides finally agreeing to allow each other to have greater autonomy in each others regions and to cease attacks on another and the Federal Government there is the final issue of the militias each side have raised; The Old Democrat's White Leagues, The Socialist Parties Red Militants and the America First Parties Minutemen. It is unlikely that peace, democracy or respect for the Federal Government can last if these militias continue to grow. The Republican cabinet has requested that each faction cease funding militia recruitment outside their territory and that militias register with state governments and are therefor legally accountable and regulated. Others in Congress want them disarmed at once however, stating that it's the only way to ensure peace. While the faction leaders have agreed to the former so long as the others yank out of 'their' regions it is unlikely they would go with the latter, though MacArthur has suggested that if we blindsided them and disarmed the militias at once they would have to go with it. Few others are confident this plan would work."
ustates.72.a: "Have them agree to weaken the militias"
ustates.72.b: "Disarm them now, when they least expect it!"

ustates.73.t: "Compromise Achieved"
ustates.73.d: "The Home Rule Act of 1937 has passed with the federal government agreeing to give far more autonomy to AFP, ODP and SPA states in terms of their economic and social policies in return for turning down their militia recruitment, ceasing their current strikes, rioting, party recruitment in other areas of the states and aggressive action against both us and each other amongst our other demands. The Socialists now currently transitioning Chicago and Detroit to semi-syndicalist systems where workers are universally unionized and own shares of production, the AFP have begun implementing a smaller and local variant of Share the Wealth and the ODP have implemented a combination of more "nativist" laws and anti-corporate policies in the American Southeast. While many within the cabinet do not like giving them control even to this degree this level of decentralization has defused each while allowing us to focus on the West and East where the federal government is still most influential while disarming them of being an outright threat on the national level while giving each major constituency what they want."
ustates.73.a: "America Saved Through Compromise"
ustates.73.b: "Who but Hoover?"

ustates.74.t: "Stephenson Scandal!"
ustates.74.d: "The National Klan has the scandal of the decade on its hands! With its reputation slows suffering after the spread of subtle anti-Klan propoaganda the Indiana Klan came under increasing scrutiny due to the apparent corruption of its political leaders, leading to the FBI arresting Grand Dragon D.C. Stephenson and his bodyguards for bribery. However since then the crimes have grown as investigations of his properties and interviews with associates has revealed Stephenson as a sexual predator and a likely murderer. With the story growing increasingly sensational Indiana Governor and suspected Klansman Edward L. Jackson is expected to resign."
ustates.74.a: "We got him!"

ustates.75.t: "SPA Reject the Compromise"
ustates.75.d: "SPA leaders have plainly stated they will not continue with the negotiations, because in the words of Haywood, "it would be foolish to encourage reaction when revolution is on the table". They have gone back to Illinois to continue organizing the Steel Belt strike. With this failure our promised plans for compromise have collapsed and Murray and Long will soon return home as well viewing this as a waste of time, with both being even angrier with Haywood than the Feds for this."
ustates.75.a: "Damn"

ustates.76.t: "MacArthur worried by agreements"
ustates.76.d: "MacArthur and the more general military leadership are concerned that the negotiations are simply giving political radicals more time to recruit and organize their paramilitaries while subverting the Constitution. [USA.GETLeader] has attempted to reassure him that this is the only way to peace and that American values will be protected but MacArthur demands to be put in charge of the general staff to ensure this is the case. While [USA.GETLeader] does not care for a military official implicitly threatening a United States President for increased power he must reach a decision."
ustates.76.a: "Very well"
ustates.76.b: "It would be undemocratic to cave in"

ustates.77.t: "Murray walks out!"
ustates.77.d: "As expected, Murray walked out on us after we refused to cave to his demand. He has declared [USA.GETLeader] to be in league with Haywood and Long, the government to have failed to represent Americans, and that America's very soul was in jeopardy. While government officials attempted to urge calm, Murray's words have struck a chord across the nation, especially the South, firing up ODP support and - as advisors had warned the President - undoing previous efforts to contain them. With Murray and the ODP raising hell, Long and Haywood are both returning home to guide their respective parties, claiming they will only return when the ODP threat is contained."
ustates.77.a: "It was unavoidable"

ustates.78.t: "MacArthur and the Army Remove [USA.GETLeader]"
ustates.78.d: "It appears [USA.GetLeader]'s time has run out. With the perception that compromise attempts have failed while various extremists continued to garner power, [USA.GETLeader]'s own cabinet has lost its confidence that any resolution would be reached with the most recent outbreak of hostilities. With the cabinet's apparent co-operation and a military clique backing him, General Douglas MacArthur took charge of an emergency administration intended to 'preserve the country from extremist forces, before we are completely overrun'. Of course this has only confirmed to the various radicals and populists that the US government was beyond saving, although MacArthur's soldiers seem prepared to fight. While the government is attempting to reassure the American public that all is under control, most are looking on in shock. Civil war appears imminent. The question remains of what the President himself should do?"
ustates.78.a: "I'm not putting up with this treachery"
ustates.78.b: "To fight it would only make it worse"

ustates.79.t: "Haywood Condemns Police Violence"
ustates.79.d: "As the SPA strike continues, spreading outside of the Steel Belt, clashes between strikers and the police have becomes more common. Some such as Norman Thomas has urged the AFL and IWW strikers to resist without violence but this hasn't always worked - especially when the strikers are simultaneously provoked by Old Democrat and Federalist supporters. Haywood has publicly condemned the government for adding to the violence, rather than protecting those who need it most. 'What these workers need are jobs that don't exploit them, that don't sacrifice their flesh and blood upon the altar of American Greed," Haywood declared in a Minneapolis speech. 'What they get instead is a government that acts at the behast of their capitalist overlords. Make no mistake that the Government's seemingly inaction is in fact action, the action of the ruling class acting with full awareness of defending of their class power.'"
ustates.79.a: "We can't hold on for long!"

ustates.80.t: "Murray Declares War On Tyranny"
ustates.80.d: "The SPA strikers aren't the only ones feeling the heat at the hands of American police. So, too, have the White Leagues come under increased scrutiny. Several Minutemen training centers in Alabama and South Carolina were raided by police in recent days, and Old Democrat meetings have been constantly harrassed - or so Klan Leader Hiram Wesley Evans has loudly complained. 'The federal government has opted for open tyranny,' he said. 'They will do anything to keep us down, when what we seek is a government that is worthy of us!' His recent speech in Charlotte was received by cheering crowds, indicative of the Old Democrats growing influence."
ustates.80.a: "We'll see about that!"

ustates.81.t: "The General Strike Spreads"
ustates.81.d: "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces, Old Democrats or even with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, and are calling for immediate government intervention."
ustates.81.a: "A disaster!"

ustates.83.t: "Clashes in the South"
ustates.83.d: "National Guard units today fought with Minutemen militia in northern Louisiana, a raid that soon turned into a bloodbath as Minutemen opened fire. In the end, over forty Guardsmen were killed as well as an unknown number of Minutemen. Huey Long and the AFP denied involvement with the militia, but questioned the presence of the National Guard in what should clearly have been a police matter. The militia, they claim, were merely defending themselves. Photos of the ensuing bloody scene have circulated in southern newspapers, resulting in a new wave of outrage from the public directed at the federal government."
ustates.83.a: "But not at the Minutemen? Not even a little?"

ustates.84.t: "The Pittsburgh Massacre"
ustates.84.d: "All it took was a single spark to start the revolution, and in Pittsburgh that spark occurred when a crowd of people stood outside one factory determined to oppose the National Guard. Guardsmen fired into the crowd leaving five dead. It did not take long for this to quickly be dubbed the 'Pittsburgh Massacre' and the Steel Belt was driven into a frenzy. Soon National Guardsmen and police were fighting with SPA militia throughout the region. Newspapers across the country have 'civil war' splashed across their headlines, and public panic is at a crescendo."
ustates.84.a: "What next?"

ustates.85.t: "March on Detriot"
ustates.85.d: "The Old Democrats, America First Party, Socialist Party of America and National Guard have once again come into conflict in Michigan when Old Democrats sought to take the Socialists to task for causing yet another strike that is exasperrating the economy. Old Democrat leaders blamed the weakness of the government in not finishing off "revolutionary leftists" and opposing the efforts of the Old Democrats to complete the goals of Woodrow Wilson and Arnold Palmer in finishing off the radicals and that the distant Federal Government bureaucrats was instead sympathetic to them and the AFP's "false egalitarianism". The official Old Democrat newsletter went on to blame the AFP and  for encouraging political corruption and the growth of the bureaucratic state while denouncing minorities in the government and which both the AFP and Socialist Party collaborate with. They ended by saying that they were organizing a march on Detroit to protest socialist behavior."
ustates.85.a: "That's not good"

ustates.86.t: "Counter Protest Organized!"
ustates.86.d: "In response to nearby Old Democrats such as Claire Hoffman helping organize the 'March on Detriot' Bill Haywood announced that a counter-protest of Red Militants will be present to protect strikers, workers and socialists from "reactionary extremists, racists and chauvinists" and warned the Old Democrats to stay away, claiming that "The forces of reaction will be sorry if they appear on the doorstep of the revolution". In response Huey Long, whom no doubt did not care for Murray's insults against him and Haywood being in the spotlight, announced that Minutemen would be present to show Americans that true Americanism is still present in these dark times and to protect American citizens from the Old Democrats and Socialists. While all sides have been criticized for their behavior and possible motives there is little doubt this will end badly."
ustates.86.a: "We will do what we can"

ustates.87.t: "Detroit Bloodbath"
ustates.87.d: "The March ended nearly as quickly as it began and, as expected, was a disaster. The SPA and Old Democrats are blaming one another for firing the first shot and it is uncertain which of the two started the outright fighting but regardless the Federal Government, Minutemen, Socialists and Old Democrats began fighting amongst each other once the rioting broke out between them and few could tell one another from each other. Eventually however it became clear that the SPA had too many supporters in the area and the other factions had to retreat. The country is quickly breaking down as the body count is well over 200 and the Federal Governments weakness has been utterly exposed and no side can rely on them to keep order against the others. On top of this the National Guard is being blamed in the papers for civilian deaths alongside the other factions, depending on which parties newsletter is doing the printing."
ustates.87.a: "Now what?"

ustates.88.t: "Compromise Fails!"
ustates.88.d: "It appears we were too cocky. While our first few raids on militia headquarters went off without a hitch we failed when attempting to arrest a group of Minutemen in Southern Missouri, resulting in a shootout that kill 34 men, 12 national guardmen and 22 minutemen. The ODP and SPA militants became even more paranoid we were planning to actually wipe them all out and have likewise fired back at our boys. Willam H. Murray, Bill Haywood and Huey Long can now finally agree on one thing; that we are not to be trusted. They have fled home to doubtlessly prepare a counter-attack before habeus corpus is likely suspended."
ustates.88.a: "War is inevitable"

### Garner Path ###

ustates.91.t: "John N. Garner's Inauguration"
ustates.91.d: "Today John Nance Garner has been sworn in as the 31st president of America. Garner's speech spoke about how we must not compromise our democratic values with radicals, left or right. Garner was quoted as saying 'We are in a tough-minded recognition that the fight for a better America is a long one.' On the economy, Garner has promised reform through personal sacrifice and austerity, as was done after the Panic of 1893. Garner enters the White House surrounded by hostile AFP and SPA Senators as well as wary Republicans, though he has assured the public that the Longists and Unionists will tire themselves out before the end of the year."
ustates.91.a: "God Save America"

ustates.9100.t: "President Announces Hard Line"
ustates.9100.d: "President [USA.GetLeader] today announced that a hard line would be taken against the SPA strikers, and indeed against any extremist force that seeks to further destabilize America. He has ordered all rioters in the Steel Belt to return home and likewise for all AFP minutemen and ODP militants to stand down before military action is taken. All SPA, AFP and ODP Senators walked out of Capitol Hill, to the jeers of their Republican and Democratic colleagues, thus adding to the sense that the country was nearing a political breaking point."
ustates.9100.a: "We will win"

ustates.9101.t: "J. Edgar Hoover's Proposal"
ustates.9101.d: "J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, arrived at the White House early today to grimly inform President [USA.GetLeader] that civil war is imminent. The best chance for the federal government, he says, is to take decisive action now before the AFP, SPA, and ODP can become more organized. A prosecution of Huey Long would mean the collapse of the AFP, as it is centered around his personality. A prosecution of Bill Haywood, meanwhile, would throw the SPA into disarray while the IWW and AFL competed for leadership... at least long enough for the immediate danger to pass. Putting William Murray in prison would certainly create doubt among his supporters, and perhaps end the ODP threat entirely. There are also reasons to pursue D.C. Stephenson or Earl Browder, less powerful members of their respective factions, but still important figures we could find something on. This would de-legitimize the faction we decide to go after, but it may not be enough to end the crisis. Still, if the FBI is to act, Hoover says, they must act now, for there is only time for one operation."
ustates.9101.a: "Investigate Huey Long"
ustates.9101.b: "Investigate Bill Haywood"
ustates.9101.c: "Investigate William H. Murray"
ustates.9101.e: "Investigate D.C. Stephenson"
ustates.9101.f: "Investigate Earl Browder"

ustates.9102.t: "Investigation turns up little"
ustates.9102.dreed: "Our investigation into Haywood has largely been a failure apart! All we have discovered is his more direct connection to SPA Militants but no one would be shocked by this."
ustates.9102.dlong: "Our investigation into Long has only overturned the typical patronage of the AFP and graft the public would basically expect anyways. There is nothing of value here."
ustates.9102.dbrowder: "Our investigation has been a total waste of resources, only discovering that Browder is something of a backroom deal cutter in the SPA. This is virtually nothing of value. Let's hope the army can maintain the peace."
ustates.9102.dMurray: "Our investigation has been a total waste of resources, only discovering that Murray has Klan associates, something most would expect despite him never commenting on it. This is virtually nothing of value. Let's hope the army can maintain the peace."
ustates.9102.a: "Damn!"

ustates.9103.t: "Military Action Prepared!"
ustates.9103.d: "Our military is prepared to defend the Republic from the radicals! The only question now is where to use it? Anti-radicals have suggested using the bulk of the military to occupy the syndicalist occupied territory that is still striking while the cabinet would like to spread out the forces more and occupy all three radical factions. George Marshall however would like to split the difference, placing most of our military in the Steel Belt while using counter-espionage in other territories to prevent an immediate revolt, though he warns this will only buy time as they are likely already announcing a revolt against the President's hardline and out of fear that Garner will come after them once the SPA is finished."
ustates.9103.a: "Focus on the Strikers"
ustates.9103.b: "Spread out our forces more evenly"
ustates.9103.c: "Follow Marshall's suggestion"

ustates.9104.t: "Resistance Rising in Illinois!"
ustates.9104.d: "Our forces have managed to force back the radical SPA activists and rioters in the Steel Belt. However the occupation is becoming increasingly difficult as the Red Militants organize against us and go beyond merely taking pot shots at our soldiers. The Cabinet is pushing us to retreat and protect Washington before the SPA forces grow too powerful but MacArthur and Eisenhower claim they can hold the territory if given reinforcements."
ustates.9104.a: "Give them what they need!"
ustates.9104.b: "Fall back!"

ustates.9105.t: "Dealing with the Steel Belt"
ustates.9105.d: "The SPA's attacks have slowed with our increase of troops damaging their efforts and leading to counter attacks on their militia headquarters under MacArthur and Eisenhower. However while the Red Militias have weakened and the government has gained legitimacy in the eyes of the citizens of the Steel Belt the workers have not yet been won over to our side, with many still refusing to work even if they are not outright SPA members. Hardliners such as Alvin M. Owlsey and Harry F. Byrd have been encouraged by our recent success and are pushing for us to finish the job by cracking down on the rest of the strikers and unions so that industry may hire new workers or they learn not to engage in such behavior. However Vice President Al Smith and other cabinet members are pushing for us to cut a deal with industry leaders to raise wages in return for protection from the militias noting that most of these workers are not natural militants if they were treated fairly and SPA support can be undercut in the process."
ustates.9105.a: "Negotiate for better wages"
ustates.9105.b: "Intensify the Occupation"

ustates.9106.t: "Revolt in the Steel Belt!"
ustates.9106.d: "Some bad news as the Steel Belt has grown increasingly unstable since Garner has taken office. More workers have joined in with the SPA as a result of our perceived weakness in stopping them and we now lack the forces needed to contain them. With entire platoons of National Guardsmen being overrun, guerilla attacks, larger riots and barriers being set up by the Red Militia in the streets of Chicago and Detroit we are forced to fallback to Washington DC. MacArthur is furious at the situation feeling victory could have been attained if the government hadn't fumbled the situation and the radicals will soon be on our doorstep due to Garner and his advisors. Likewise the Old Democrats are furious they're being attacked in SPA controlled areas and many of their supporters are falling back to more southern regions of the Steel Belt."
ustates.9106.a: "Not Great"

ustates.9107.t: "Revolt in the Steel Belt!"
ustates.9107.d: "Some bad news as the occupation has not gone as planned. More workers have joined in with the SPA as a result of our perceived oppression of the workers and we now lack the forces needed to contain them. With entire platoons being overrun, guerilla attacks, larger riots and barriers being set up by the Red Militia in the streets of Chicago and Detroit we are forced to fallback to Washington DC. MacArthur is furious at the situation feeling victory could have been attained if the government hadn't fumbled the situation and the radicals will soon be on our doorstep due to Garner and his advisors. Likewise the Old Democrats are furious they're being attacked in SPA controlled areas and many of their supporters are falling back to more southern regions of the Steel Belt."
ustates.9107.a: "Damn!"

ustates.9108.t: "Hoover's Dirt"
ustates.9108.d: "Our investigation has uncovered important evidence! J. Edgar Hoover has alerted us that he has evidence of Indiana Klan Leader D.C. Stephenson's corruption, which includes him and his circle engaging in alcohol, drugs, intimidation, 'relations' with minors, sexual assault, and murder. While it is unclear why Hoover kept this information to himself, he may have been hedging his bets to use this information as a bargaining chip. Despite [USA.GetLeader]'s disgust with Hoover for not pursuing this earlier, it is obvious that publishing this and bringing Stephenson to court could discredit the Klan."
ustates.9108.a: "Arrest Stephenson"

ustates.92.t: "The Austerity Bill"
ustates.92.d: "President Garner has introduced an Emergency Austerity Measures bill into Congress today, an almost certainly controversial piece of legislation which would see government spending cuts across the board - especially towards non-army based military spending and federal spending on construction projects. Garner's speech to the Senate spoke of the sacrifice needed if America is to recover from the Great Depression and attempted to boost market confidence by stating that the cut was partially due to the belief of his cabinet that the Depression was already coming to an end, and it was met with mostly skepticism and jeers from radical Senators. Even Garner's own cabinet expressed reservations regarding his choice, suggesting passage of the bill might prove difficult... though, if it can be managed, it would almost certainly save the country by reinvigorating private investor confidence in the nation."
ustates.92.a: "Believe in America"

ustates.93.t: "Long Denounces Austerity Measures"
ustates.93.d: "As discussions began in Capitol Hill regarding the austerity bill, the AFP immediately denounced it. Huey Long said in a Louisiana speech that austerity did the exact opposite of what was necessary. Rather than sharing the wealth, it took every last bit of wealth from those who needed it most. Austerity, he claims, would leave the average American more desperately poor than they are now, and would leave them vulnerable to syndicalist and reactionary rhetoric. Long said he would be directing the AFP to oppose the bill at every turn, for the sake of the country."
ustates.93.a: "We shall see"

ustates.94.t: "D.C. Demonstration Turns Violent"
ustates.94.d: "A demonstration in Washington D.C. by workers and strikers voicing their disapproval of the austerity measures bill, today turned violent as police attempted to break up the crowd. SPA members present said theirs was a peaceful protest, that police provoked the crowd into a response. Regardless of the cause, the end result was a pitched battle with police that left the city in chaos for two days and left hundreds of protestors injured. SPA leader Bill Haywood condemned the police action as brutality and imperialist suppression."
ustates.94.a: "Fanatical Scum!"

ustates.95.t: "General Strike Spreads"
ustates.95.d: "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces or with rival militias. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, calling for immediate government intervention."
ustates.95.a: "Damned Fools!"

ustates.96.t: "Austerity Bill Voting Commences"
ustates.96.d: "Voting on the Emergency Austerity Measures bill began in Congress today, though early indications were not good. While the bill is solidly backed by Democratic Senators, it is rabidly opposed by both the SPA and AFP... and while there are enough Republican and ODP Senators remaining on the fence, passage may prove unlikely without intervention. It is possible that President Garner could campaign for the votes of influential Republicans and hope that enough Old Democrats break party line to vote for the bill. A coalition may not have been in the cards, but perhaps he could appeal to their sense of civic duty on this one instance alone?"
ustates.96.a: "Appeal to other parties"
ustates.96.b: "We don't need them"

ustates.97.t: "Violence in Atlanta"
ustates.97.d: "Our counter-espionage and generally lightly-equipped forces in the South can no longer hold the region, despite many ODP members being initially satisifed with our occupation of the Steel Belt. With our agents being increasingly rooted out in NDWL organizations, they have finally retaliated by assassinating several FBI agents at their supposed "Safehouse" in Atanta, with White Leaguers opening fire from outside with shotguns. The NDWL is openly organizing against us, aware that we are coming for them and that our forces are still stuck in the Steel Belt."
ustates.97.a: "Traitors!"

ustates.98.t: "Austerity Bill Fails"
ustates.98.d: "While President Garner campaigned long and hard into the night, at the end of the day there were simply too few Republican and ODP Senators willing to vote for the bill that they didn't have the support of the SPA and AFP, and which would likely result in violence anyhow."
ustates.98.a: "Congress isn't worth piss anyways"

ustates.99.t: "Steel Belt Pacified!"
ustates.99.d: "With businesses in the Steel Belt agreeing to pay workers more and the army continuing to push back the Red Militias an increasing number of workers are viewing the Federal government as a more stable source of protection and income than the SPA. With it becoming clear that outright revolt will not succeed many SPA congressional leaders are listening to their more moderate wing and calling for calmness and an end to hostilities saying that better conditions can still be negotiated for through Congress."
ustates.99.a: "Have we saved America?"

ustates.100.t: "Third Parties Stumble"
ustates.100.d: "With the Democratic Party reabsorbing much of their old constiuencies among the Old Democrats, Southern AFP and even part of the Steel Belt that is becoming connected to the Democratic-party based unions and political machines the third parties that once challanged the Democrats and Republicans at the national level have become state-level parties instead, with Long's AFP being the most succesful but becoming relegated to running Louisiana and some assorted populist districts, his influence in Congress remaining only due to his willingness to work with progressives. However, the Progressives are increasingly being reabsorbed by the Republicans with George Norris, Hiram Johnson, and others returning to the Republican fold. Meanwhile the Old Democrats and White Leagues are still present in the American Southeast but most are more or less either rejoining the Democrats or becoming relegated to the fringe elsewhere. SPA no longer commands the power it once did with its revolutionary tendencies being discredited and it's unlikely they will hold any seat higher than the House of Representatives for long. It seems the stability of the two-party system has been preserved at the national level and the radicals have been displaced."
ustates.100.a: "Did they really think they could end liberal democracy?"

ustates.104.t: "MacArthur and the Army Remove Garner"
ustates.104.d: "It appears President Garner's time is up. Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today, having declared Garner an 'ineffective president whose weakness has endangered America'. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the country from extremist forces. Garner's own cabinet has assured the public that this action is necessary, and have been working with MacArthur to install an emergency government from the White House - even as the majority of America looks on in shock. Civil war is imminent. Garner himself is forced to choose between fleeing the nation or accepting his new role as a President-in-name only."
ustates.104.a: "I won't resist for the good of the nation"
ustates.104.b: "Get me to California!"

ustates.105.t: "Austerity Bill Passes"
ustates.105.d: "President Garner campaigned long and hard into the night and at the end of the day there were just enough Republican Senators and ODP senators willing to vote for a bill that it managed to pass. Garner was fortunate that with the sudden downfall of D.C. Stephenson the ODP's party discipline has weakened to the point that ODP congressmen such as Philip H. Stoll were willing to cross the aisle to make overtures to more traditional democrats and distance themselves somewhat from more militant White Leaguers."
ustates.105.a: "Thank God"

### Norris route ###

ustates.106.t: "Norris' Inauguration"
ustates.106.d: "WIth Quentin Roosevelt at his side, George Norris has been formally inaugurated as President of the United States, declaring he would reunite Americans under a government that would see them through these dark times and end economic neediness and political violence through negotiation. Declaring a moralistic and optimistic vision of the future and a desire to work with economic progressives whenever possible in direct contrast to the former administration his speech was met with applause, although the ODP and many conservatives are less than enthusiastic."
ustates.106.a: "The Future is Now"

ustates.107.t: "Norris Proposes Intervention"
ustates.107.d: "In response to the ongoing crisis, President Norris has proposed a bill to begin a series of economic intervention policies. The bill will create an insurance for bank deposits in treasury-approved banks that will not engage in risky investing. The bill also allows the federal government to create a comission to monitor stock market exchanges against fraud. The Progressives believe this will restore confidence in the market, creating jobs from one end of the country to the other. Both the SPA and the AFP have declared support for the bill despite believing it does not go far enough and believing it may be too friendly to the very businesses that caused the depression in the first place. The ODP meanwhile claim this is just another way for federal liberals to empower wealthy cosmopolitans and progressives in D.C. at the expense of Americans, calling for banks to be broken up and handed to native citizens on the state level. We may have to modify the bill to get more of the AFP and SPA on board, of which Quentin Roosevelt has proposed to retroactively investigate those who may have commited fraud and charge them to show we are the not the same people as the corrupt elements of the business community who caused this crash as well as our committment to justice."
ustates.107.a: "Make a promise to bring fraudsters to justice"
ustates.107.b: "Opening old wounds will simply damage the economy"

ustates.109.t: "Haywood and Long Arrive"
ustates.109.d: "Bill Haywood and Huey Long have come out of their respective safehouses to meet the new president of the United States at his invitation. While Long is more open to working with Norris he has made it clear that he wants for the AFP strongholds and its allies to have immediate access to rural aid, with the AFP receiving credit for the relief. Haywood on the other hand had more radical demands, demanding support for workers coops, urban spending, the release of a laundry list of SPA activists who were arrested for various relatively petty crimes and government protection of unions. He went on to state the SPA should be given greater leniancy over the region, at which point Long demanded the same for the AFP and that he would like to be involved in passing the relief bill."
ustates.109.a: "That's how it will have to be"
ustates.109.b: "They ask too much, send them home"

ustates.110.t: "Murray denounces the Progressives"
ustates.110.d: "Oklahoma Senator and ODP Leader William H. Murray has denounced the President as betraying the foundation of America by bringing two radicals and race traitors into the White House to conspire against the good Christian men and women of the nation. Using words that newspapers opted not to reprint in full, jeers came from the ODP wing of Congress as Thedore Bilbo cried out 'God Bless Alfalfa!' Other members of Congress denounced the speech however and afterwards William Borah of Idaho accused Murray of attempting to incite civil disobedience."
ustates.110.a: "Damn him"

ustates.1100.t: "White Leagues take to the streets"
ustates.1100.d: "The White Leagues have taken to the streets against what they perceive as the favoring of the progressive coalition at the expense of the ODP and NDWL, rioting against black businesses and federal buildings. While our forces are doing what they can to contain them, the NDWL's more organized forces are being provided with aid from ODP leaders and we are expected to retreat soon, to the outrage of our military."
ustates.1100.a: "We've lost our window"

ustates.111.t: "General Strike Spreads"
ustates.111.d: "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, after a call by Bill Haywood to demonstrate against the latest bout of government inaction, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces, the ODP militants or even with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, calling for immediate government intervention. All paramilitaries involved have begun organizing their respective forces and contacting governors and other politicians in their camp. Another Civil War appears to be coming to America."
ustates.111.a: "What have we done?"

ustates.112.t: "Relief Bill Passes"
ustates.112.d: "The Long-Haywood Bill (originally the Haywood-Long Bill before Long insisted on a change) has passed congress! However, the ODP is refusing to accept the aid claiming that its a ploy to increase the power of hostile entities over their people, citing the bill increasing the power and funding of the SPA and AFP, and announced they would not allow AFP strongholds within their territory to receive "aid from a criminal government". They insist that they be allowed to handle all relief funds in their area or retribution is inevitable, with Senator Ellison D. "Cotton Ed" Smith promising "a Great Reckoning". On a brighter note the SPA has called off the general strike for the moment."
ustates.112.a: "Good, but bad"

ustates.113.t: "ODP Infuriated"
ustates.113.d: "The ODP is unsurprisingly demanding that we reverse our decision to send troops to the White League occupied American Southeast alongside various other areas of the nation. Murray has called it 'DC tyranny' amongst other things while John E. Rankin shouted every slur he could seeminly think of in response to the occupation of Mississippi. They are currently stalling as much as possible in Congress and the National Democratic White League under Joseph Simmons has printed newsletters decrying us. While some want us to pull back at once Douglas MacArthur has demanded we stay and finish the job, and that the SPA and AFP must show their loyality to America by having their militias work with federal military officers to support controlling the border regions of the ODP strongholds."
ustates.113.a: "Follow MacArthur's suggestion"
ustates.113.b: "This was a bad idea, pull out"

ustates.1131.t: "White Leaguers Strike!"
ustates.1131.d: "A small unit of our men sent to keep the peace in South Carolina have been ambushed while walking the streets of Raleigh, with several White Leaguers opening fire on them and raining firebombs on them. The act was applauded by the notably extreme South Carolina governor Coleman Blease, an affiliate of the so-called "Old Klan" who has stated that South Carolia will not stand for a "Second Reconstruction" and that retribution is inevitable. Arresting him is likely to incite a revolt but some progressives are pressing us to do so. For what his opinion is worth, MacArthur believes that it would be dangerous to arrest the governor and that it would put his men at further risk."
ustates.1131.a: "Just focus on the White Leagues"
ustates.1131.b: "Arrest Blease"

ustates.1132.t: "Increased Presence Requested"
ustates.1132.d: "While not a fan of our governments agenda MacArthur was ready to give Norris a chance to follow through on his plans to end the militis. However, the National Democratic White League has been wearing down the army in recent days with its guerilla warfare and political pressuring. MacArthur has demanded increased military funding to keep the NDWL from seizing ODP strongholds, stating that we would be dooming America to not give him into his request."
ustates.1132.a: "That's fair, increase his budget"
ustates.1132.b: "He will have to make do with what he has"

ustates.1133.t: "National Debt Growth"
ustates.1133.d: "As the saying goes, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Our attempts to relieve the economy through direct spending effort has born debt just as it has fruit, and will likely take while to pay down. At the very least, we likely can not safetly focus on such a task until our current projects are finished at this point. Nonetheless Democratic politicians such as Al Smith and John Nance Garner are demanding we reign in our spending or they will being blocking spending projects. However we are simply too tied to our new progressive alliance to do such a thing."
ustates.1133.a: "For the moment, we must keep spending"

ustates.114.t: "Hoover's Dirt"
ustates.114.d: "Our occupation of the South has not been easy, with the Old Democrats resisting us and the National Klan denouncing us as traitors. Nonetheless while occupation has prevented an outright uprising it is clear that without the Klan losing support through other means we can not finish the job or hold on forever. Today however J. Edgar Hoover has alerted us that he has evidence of Indiana Klan Leader D.C. Stephenson's corruption, which includes him and his circle engaging in alcohol, drugs, intimidation, 'relations' with minors, sexual assault, and murder. While it is clear Hoover is interested in being rewarded for this find with increased FBI presence it is nonetheless neccessary to play along as publishing this and bringing Stephenson to court could discredit the Klan."
ustates.114.a: "Very well, arrest Stephenson"

ustates.115.t: "Simmons grilled by Congress"
ustates.115.d: "William Joseph Simmons was questioned about his connections to the terrorist attacks committed by the NDWL during the occuption alongside Hiram Wesley Evans. Without the political clout they once had to protect them for inquiry it quickly became obvious that Simmons implausble stories of knowing nothing of the groups committing the acts could no longer be hidden from public eye. Both Simmons and Evans will likely stand trial soon. Meanwhile NDWL numbers are collapsing since the Stephenson scandal, with this recent action only accelerating its collapse. In Congress some ODP members such as Edward E. Cox and Carl Vinson are even crossing the floor and rejoining the Democratic Party, weakening the ODP as a politcal force and virtually ending the NDWL as a major political force."
ustates.115.a: "Wonderful!"

ustates.1150.t: "Stephenson's Bargain"
ustates.1150.d: "Initially arrested by the FBI for his murders and other personal crimes, charges of conspiring attacks against civilians or at best knowing of them before they happened as likewise been added to his charges. The Indiana Klan is in shambles as Governor Edward Jackson, a near certain former Klan member himself, are attempting to distance themselves from the Klan. Stephenson however has requested that we take the death penalty off the table, in return for giving up the names of prominent Klan members and testifying against their activities. While this would aid in our fight, many would prefer to see him brought to justice and a deal cut with someone else."
ustates.1150.a: "Cut the Deal"
ustates.1150.b: "Throw the book at him, followed by the chair"

ustates.1151.t: "Fate of Allied Militias"
ustates.1151.d: "While the militias of the AFP and SPA were helpful to putting down the revolt it can not be healthy for a democracy to have either be a regular feature of American life. With our forces no longer having to contend with the NDWL and the AFP and SPA relying on Washington to support them economically we can begin to use backdoor channels to pressure both into decreasing their militia presence and recruitment."
ustates.1151.a: "America has been Saved"

ustates.1152.t: "Ending the Occupation?"
ustates.1152.d: "With the South pacified and the NDWL decimated it is likely time to pull out our forces from the South, as we would be only incurring hatred after a certain point and George Marshall claims the occupied counties are exhausted, although he advises that we leave behind some men to protect Black and allied regions. However General Joseph McNarney advises us to pull out altogether."
ustates.1152.a: "Leave behind some men"
ustates.1152.b: "It's time to leave altogether"

### Victory in the civil war

ustates.116.t: "MacArthur's Power"
ustates.116.d: "With our victory in the civil war, a question must be decided upon. Should Douglas MacArthur resign as President and ensure a peaceful transition of power or should he remain in control to protect America? Hard liners within MacArthur's clique insist that the US will fall back into civil war without him, while Republicans and some Democrats claim MacArthur would be a tyrant to stay."
ustates.116.a: "MacArthur remains in power."
ustates.116.b: "MacArthur gives up power."

ustates.117.t: "Democracy Triumphs"
ustates.117.d: "At long last, the Republic has been saved. The radicals from both the left and the right which tried to destroy America have been defeated. We may have been battered and bruised but democracy has been saved."
ustates.117.a: "God Bless America."

ustates.118.t: "Malice or Charity"
ustates.118.d: "The question of what to do with those that fought against the government has to be decided. Shall we offer clemency to those that fought against the government and try and rehabilitate them back into society or shall they be punished for their actions against America?"
ustates.118.a: "Charity."
ustates.118.b: "Malice."

ustates.119.t: "The fate of the Electoral College"
ustates.119.d: "As we work to strengthen democracy following the civil war, the question of the Electoral College has been brought up. Many are calling for the end to first-past-the-post voting for state electors. This would be replaced by a more simple national popular voting system. A majority of Congress believes that we should keep FPTP around as a safeguard against radicalism in the future. What should we do?"
ustates.119.a: "We shall adopt Popular Vote."
ustates.119.b: "The Electoral College Stays!"

ustates.120.t: "National Rehabilitation"
ustates.120.d: "While we root out those that continue to still fight on for their treasonous cause, the question has come before MacArthur about what to do to those that have laid down their arms. Some of his advisers are suggesting clemency others suggest they must be imprisoned for their actions. What shall the commander in chief choose?"
ustates.120.a: "Down with the Traitors."
ustates.120.b: "We have spilt enough blood."

ustates.121.t: "Reconcile with Washington?"
ustates.121.d: "The Tyrant MacArthur has done the unthinkable and has stepped down from power. Thus a debate has arisen about if we should reunite and make America whole. Many believe that even though MacArthur has stepped down from power, he still has control and that he won't hesitate to re-assume power should politics don't go his way."
ustates.121.a: "Let us reunite with Washington(Game Over)"
ustates.121.b: "We are the true America and we shall unite America ourselves!"

ustates.122.t: "America is reunited!"
ustates.122.d: "The rebel government out west has decided to lay down their arms and rejoin America. The military checkpoints along the Rocky Mountains are being dismantled and people from both sides of the country are crossing over. At long last the country is reunited."
ustates.122.a: "From Sea to shining Sea!"

ustates.123.t: "No Reconciliation"
ustates.123.d: "Since MacArthur stepped down many wondered if the country would be whole again. However it seems that the rebels out west have decided that they shall not reunite with us. In their senate, they denounced Congress as just being a pawn of MacArthur who they still regard as a tyrant despite the fact he saved the country."
ustates.123.a: "America one day shall be reunited."

ustates.124.t: "America is Reunited"
ustates.124.d: "At long last America has been reunited. We stretch once again from sea to shining sea. The traitors to the country have been destroyed and the stars and stripes now fly proudly from coast to coast knowing that liberty is secured for all."
ustates.124.a: "A more perfect union."

ustates.125.t: "The National Labor Relations Board"
ustates.125.d: "With the civil war over and reconstruction now under way, the question of trade unions have been brought up. Some think that we should promote more liberal and anti-syndicalist unions to be a ward against the influence of Syndicalism in politics. A few loyalists within the AFL and the defunct Knights of Labor are willing to cooperate with Congress in creating a national labor relations board. This board would be able to isolate IWW-affiliated unions, and give collective bargaining rights to unions that do not wish to see us hang. Others however, regard all trade unions as traitors to the country and should be outlawed toggether. Congress has decided to...?"
ustates.125.a: "Accept the AFL and KoL into the NLRB."
ustates.125.b: "Outlaw all Unions regardless of loyalty."

ustates.126.t: "Army is slow to desegregate"
ustates.126.d: "After the President signed a law to desegregate the Armed Forces, it seems that it is taking more time then expected to fully desegregate. There are still black only and white only regiments and several officers are determined to keep things separate. Despite the slowness, things are improving as more and more units are desegregating. Still, Progress is slow."
ustates.126.a: "Desegregation shall still happen."

ustates.127.t: "The Red Scare"
ustates.127.d.macarthur: "Since MacArthur has taken power he has begun a campaign against socialism, anarchism, and syndicalism. They are after all the main instigators of the civil war and as such all Americans must know the role that they played in the conflict and as such as the so-called 'red scare' begins many are being forced out of jobs and are being blacklisted."
ustates.127.d.elected: "Since the election of [USA.GetLeader], the government of the United States has begun a campaign against socialist of all stripes. They were one of the main instigators of the civil war and as such all Americans must understand their role. Moreover socialists and syndicalists must not allow their subversion to survive and as such as the so-called 'red scare' begins many are being forced out of jobs and are being blacklisted."
ustates.127.a: "Better Dead than Red."

ustates.128.t: "Lavender Scare"
ustates.128.d: "With the so-called Red Scare under way, [USA.GetLeader] has passed Executive Order 10450 that broadened the definition of a national security risk to include 'Any criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct, habitual use of intoxicants to excess, drug addiction, or sexual perversion.'. This has led to the firing of over 5,000 federal employees who were accused of being homosexual. The press have mostly approved of this measure, although a few tabloids claim we are preaching hypocracy. One of the chief prosecutors, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, has long been rumoured to be in the closet with his secretary Clyde Tolson. As Director of the most important intelligence agency, Hoover is of course beyond investigation. Even if we were to, J. Edgar probably has much more dirt on us than we have on him."
ustates.128.a: "Let's not investigate J. Edgar Hoover."

ustates.1280.t: "Angered Congressmen"
ustates.1280.d: "Some Congressmen have become upset by our decision not to return power to them, notably Matthew M. Neely whom has long led the faction anywhere from ambigious to mildly hostile on the question of MacArthur, though they still allowed him to take charge. We could undermine his faction by bribing their members or, perhaps, simply arresting and questioning them?"
ustates.1280.a: "Bribery Will Gain More Love"
ustates.1280.b: "Arrests, now"
ustates.1280.c: "Both"
ustates.1280.e: "Neither, we're fine"

ustates.1281.t: "Navy Demands!"
ustates.1281.d: "The Navy is already demanding additional funding, autonomy, and staffing in return for their loyalty to MacArthur. The rivalry between the army and navy has long been known and has only grown since MacArthur took power. William D. Leahy is in particular disgusted by the decision of MacArthur to keep power, and on top of the existing demands wants for MacArthur to keep out of Congressional elections. Meanwhile, Ernest King is reported to be filled with rage at MacArthur's constant attempts to exercise more control (and general army superiority) over the Navy. While army insiders hate the demands Leahy has made, we may have to accept for the moment to keep these wings of the admirality in-line."
ustates.1281.a: "Agree... for now"
ustates.1281.b: "NO"

ustates.1282.t: "Ernest J. King's offer"
ustates.1282.d: "Admiral Ernest J. King, while loyal enough to MacArthur thus far, clearly has his own vision for how the country should be run. Worse, he tires of the relentless orders coming from MacArthur's office, seeing him as no better than himself, and believing the army has no right to control the navy. Though King's criticisms are not the same as Leahy's, it seems that both men are threats that will need to be dealt with if we are to have a stable regime and ultimately win the war. Taking note of Leahy's antagonism towards MacArthur, King has come to MacArthur with an offer to take the whole of the navy in a bid to make it run more efficiently, while also guaranteeing some sort of stability in this branch. However, other admirals warn that King is an even less trustworthy advisor than Leahy, and that he seeks his own gain. J. Edgar Hoover has offered to be the one to find a way to get rid of Admiral King if need be, but given his talent, we cannot indulge this offer. We must decide: will we accept King's offer or risk the fallout of denying him?"
ustates.1282.a: "Back King"
ustates.1282.b: "Ask Congress to help bring these admirals to heel!"
ustates.1282.c: "No, we're fine as is"

ustates.1283.t: "Legion members win elections"
ustates.1283.d: "Increasingly members of the American Legion running for Congress are winning seats with an impressively large percent of the vote when running against critics of MacArthur. Of course, this has lead to criticisms that the American Legion is fixing elections on the current regimes behalf and that the Legion members whom stand outside election boxes are acting against democracy. Naturally, the American Legion is asking for our support by having us undermine these newspapers through fines and jailing for their lies."
ustates.1283.a: "Yes, Protect the Legion"
ustates.1283.b: "We'll Stay out of this one"

ustates.1284.t: "War Propaganda League Requests Radio America!"
ustates.1284.d: "A new subdivision of the War Department, the War Propaganda League, is requesting funding to create Radio America, a program that will allow them to reach out to citizens in a more personal manner in support of the USA, especially in regards to the threats the anarchists, Longists and Old Democrats show. They have taken notice of a young actor who has been particularly vocal in his support of the Federalist cause named Ronald Reagan, whom has been selected to host the program if it is approved given the story of him moving East in support of us is in-and-of-itself making the rounds. With our shortage of support among much of the public outside of D.C. itself, it would certainly help."
ustates.1284.a: "Back the project"
ustates.1284.b: "Seems like a waste of money"

ustates.1285.t: "Report on the Combined Syndicates"
ustates.1285.d: "Listen citizens, there is a new report from the Combined Syndicates and let me warn you, it's not good. Apparently the anarchists and communists and other red fanatics have already undergone the process of claiming the property of the Americans unlucky enough to live in their territory. Reed, Foster, Browder and the other high priests of the syndicalist cause believe that by robbing their citizens of freedom they are paving the way for a glorious new future, as we've seen in the case of the equally tyrannical Commune of France and Union of Britain, which have both exiled their own citizens and do no allow a word spoken against their regimes. Now, I hope I don't have to tell you how lucky we are to live in such a territory with the protection of the Red, White and Blue but just in case, we are lucky indeed. So next time you go to your home, or your job, remember what could happen if the Combined Syndicalists win, and what you can do to prevent that! That's Radio America from Ronald Reagan, signing out."
ustates.1285.a: "A Fine Message"

ustates.1286.t: "Report on the Old Democrats"
ustates.1286.d: "Hello citizens, I'm afraid I have some unfortunate news for you. It appears that the Old Democrats in the deep south are terrorizing their own citizens, as per usual, and have empowered the terroristic Black Legion to commit crimes against everyday citizens, black and white. Apparently, raids on Black Territory in the South by the KKK are commonplace, where they commit all manner of unholy behavior. Thankfully with the might of the Congress and the General on our side we can not only not suffer as they are, but liberate them as well. Remember that everytime you aid MacArthur, you aid America. Thank you."
ustates.1286.a: "A Fine Message"

ustates.1287.t: "Pennsylvania is ours!"
ustates.1287.d: "Good news my fellow Americans! We have taken the former territories of the Combined Syndicates which is properly known as the state of Pennsylvania. Average Americans whom fretted about being attacked by the Red Guard or wondered if they would ever see their belongings or property again, have been restored. Militants who carried out their crazed 'vigilante justice' have been captured so they can face property justice. And their leaders are running scared. Soon America will be properly one."
ustates.1287.a: "God Bless Radio America"

ustates.1288.t: "Huey Long falls!"
ustates.1288.d: "The great charlatan known as Huey Long has finally lost! Is it any shock that such a character could fail to properly govern a citizenry as naturally honest and freedom-loving as the American People? His so-called Minutemen are soon to be relics of the past, where they belong so the true Minutemen of 1776 can be properly remembered and continue to live on in the American Spirit. Likewise, his socialism dressed up as something else will soon likewise be forgotten. While it may not seem it, his fall is yet another step towards a total victory for America."
ustates.1288.a: "God Bless Radio America"

ustates.1289.t: "Congress hails MacArthur!"
ustates.1289.d: "With his declaration of America being safe from the radicals, General MacArthur has said that he is formally stepping down from his place of executive power alongside other members of the military. Congress burst into applause and he has been praised as the 'American Cinncinatus' whom saved the United States from the various extremists who would've destroyed it. Already he is being considered for the rank of Six Star General, an honor not bestowed since Washington himself."
ustates.1289.a: "America is saved"

ustates.129.t: "Trial of the Weapons companies"
ustates.129.d: "A number of Weapons companies have fought for the various traitors and rebels against America. Thus a hearing has been brought before Congress to decide their fate. Shall we allow them to operate again, or shall they be regarded as traitors and be treated as such?"
ustates.129.a: "Allow them to operate again."
ustates.129.b: "They are traitors and should be treated as such."

ustates.1291.a: "Allow them to operate again."
ustates.1291.b: "They are traitors and should be treated as such."

ustates.1292.t: "Leahy Leads Democratic Forces to Coup the Government"
ustates.1292.d: "Though Admiral William D. Leahy initially gave his implicit support to the MacArthur regime, it quickly became apparent that the two would have disagreements over MacArthur's treatment of Congress and the rest of Washington. Leahy, believing that the military should largely stay out of politics, has protested MacArthur's restrictions on Congress, arguing that they endanger the very principles the country was founded on. Recently, in what appears to have been a watershed moment, MacArthur announced that the military would take a role in congressional elections as well, causing Leahy to lead disgruntled politicians, admirals, and even some army men to coup the government. \n\nDouglas MacArthur was arrested during the coup, and with the coup being almost bloodless, it seems like an excellent outcome for what was certainly an extremely risky maneuver. However, Leahy must now contend with the rest of the United States; Bradley and Eisenhower in the WCC, perhaps sympathizing with Leahy's cause but unlikely to approve of a navy dominant over the army, the pretender regime on the West Coast, and the various extremist factions that threaten to tear this nation apart. Regardless, Leahy has the support of much of Washington, and it seems that even Ernest King has agreed to fall in line behind Leahy's leadership, viewing him as one of the only men he would ever follow. What will happen next is yet to be seen..."
ustates.1292.a: "Wars cannot be won by destroying everything we believe in!"

ustates.1293.t: "King Takes Control in Washington!"
ustates.1293.d: "When Douglas MacArthur took over the government, Admiral Ernest King was one of the original supporters of the decision, viewing it as a necessity to save the country from certain destruction. Since then though, King has chafed under the command of MacArthur, viewing his constant dismissals of the navy as disrespectful and a danger to the war effort. Though MacArthur ultimately relented and gave King control over the navy recently, it seems the move was only an attempt by King to gain more power, and it was ultimately successful. King, with the support of Leahy and several disgruntled generals, led a coup in Washington today, arresting Douglas MacArthur and taking the entirety of the government within a few short hours. \n\nNow, King must face the war MacArthur started, and though little time has passed, it already seems that King will face significant roadblocks to a victory in the Civil War. The WCC, led by Dwight Eisenhower and Omar Bradley, is unlikely to give much support to King, viewing him as merely another iteration of MacArthur, and since he wears a navy uniform rather than an army one, they are even less likely to be supportive. Meanwhile, the Pacific is sure to see this coup as merely another justification for the existence of their own regime, arguing that true stability exists in the West. Beyond these groups, the various extremists that run roughshot over our rightful territory must also be dealt with. The future is unclear..."
ustates.1293.a: "Anyone who won't take a chance now and then isn't worth a damn."

ustates.1294.t: "MacArthur Loyalists Flee West!"
ustates.1294.d: "Though we were successful in detaining Douglas MacArthur, many of his close lieutenants eluded us on the day of the coup, and now they have fled west to the Western Command Center. Admiral King has denounced these men, arguing that their loyalty was to a man and not the country, and that perhaps they are of better use in the West. What no side has mentioned is that this is only the latest development in the seemingly growing rivalry between the army and navy, now taking place in the form of the Western Command Center against the United States government. Dwight Eisenhower has been said to take a personal disliking to King, viewing his arrogance and aggression as unbecoming of an American admiral. For his part, Omar Bradley has largely remained quiet on King, but it seems that neither Eisenhower nor Bradley has a favorable opinion of the man in Washington. Never before in U.S. history has the divide between army and navy been so apparent, and it is sure to be a cause for tension for years after the war unless we act quickly..."
ustates.1294.a: "If it is absolutely necessary, perhaps we can reconcile with the army."
ustates.1294.b: "We have no need for them!"

ustates.1295.t: "The End of the War?"
ustates.1295.d.king: "With the Civil War all but over, it should be a cause for celebration for Federal forces, and yet there is only tension across the country. The rivalry between the army and navy was only exasperated when Admiral Ernest King took control over the U.S. government, removing a tyrant but quickly becoming one in his own right. Now, we must make a choice. Will we push for the restoration of democratic government, or make King an offer he can't afford to refuse?"
ustates.1295.d.leahy: "With the Civil War all but over, it is a cause for celebration across America that the army and navy seem to have put aside their differences for the good of the nation. Omar Bradley, Dwight Eisenhower, and William Leahy have agreed on how they will restore democracy to the battered nation, and together, we will move towards a new future!"
ustates.1295.a: "We must do the right thing!"

ustates.1295.c: "The first step towards rebuilding the country!"

ustates.1296.t: "The West Revolts!"
ustates.1296.d: "News of what seemed to be Civil War's end was met with little enthusiasm today. Tensions between the U.S. army and navy are higher than ever, and though Bradley and Eisenhower stood aside while King couped MacArthur, they will no longer stay quiet. The two men have proclaimed themselves as the saviors of democracy and now march against us! It seems this Civil War will last longer than we thought..."

ustates.134.t: "The Great Migration"
ustates.134.d: "As MacArthur has not given up power, a large number of Americans have made their way to [migrate.GetNameDef] - which is occupying American land and desecrating the flag and everything we hold dear. The question, however, is what shall we do in regard to this 'Great Migration'? Should we let these traitors freely go and present a security risk, or shall we use the army to capture and detain as many as possible?"

As such a large wave of Americans are making their way across the [Root.GetAdjective] border where they will find a new life out of MacArthur's shadow. Moreover, military leaders believe that we shall be able to make use of this intel and use it against [USA.GetNameDef], if it comes to that."
ustates.135.d.army: "As expected, the tyrant Douglas MacArthur has refused to give up his grip on power. A wave of migrants and refugees have come across the [Root.GetAdjective] border. While we and our special services have done what we could to bring them across, MacArthur used his army upon many, massacring them like the butcher that he is. However, this has only fueled people's desire to see MacArthur punished."

ustates.136.t: "Provisional President"
ustates.136.d: "With democracy now restored to the country, the question is who shall lead the country until the next election? MacArthur has picked three men who could serve in that role and submitted their names to Congress: Quentin Roosevelt, Wendell Willkie, and John Nance Garner."

ustates.150.t: "The Twentieth Amendment"
ustates.150.d: "The Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution has been proposed. This amendment would make it so that the President of the United States of America is elected by the direct popular suffrage of the country. The current Electoral College system was last modified in the 14th Amendment almost a century ago. The bill, as proposed by a minority coalition of Social Democrats within the Republicans and Democrats has very little chance of succeeding. It is claimed by the supporters that doing this will help prevent another crisis like the 1936 crisis from happening again. The party leadership of both e Republicans and Democrats disagree, saying that the Electoral College was the only thing that kept the United States from totally dissolving in 1936. A long week of debating has left every avenue explored, and ultimately..... "

ustates.152.t: "NAACP and FBI Defames Socialists"
ustates.152.d: "During the 1930s, a large part of the NAACP's activities were taken up by litigation in favour of African American rights. This was due to the retreating strength of the black vote and the diminishing ability of African Americans to reach office after Plessy v. Ferguson. This avenue was also pursued by the syndicalist aligned International Labor Defence, who countered the NAACP for a decade in a competition for the hearts of black voters. Seeing no other option and being unwilling to ever compromise with socialists, NAACP leader Walter Francis White has decided to cooperate with the FBI in an anti-socialist public relations campaign. Whether this truly motivates civil rights or further dilutes the current remains to be seen."

ustates.156.t: "Division Over Big Business Support"
ustates.156.d: "It is known by most Democrats that economic reform is necessary to preserve American integrity, to this end Democrats differ on the agency the government must take towards existing industries that are ailing. A proposed civil works program to electrify the Southwest using hydroelectric power hit a snag as Democrats could not agree on the role of public works in the marketplace. The Works would be able to undercut private electricity companies because it would be able to cross state borders and build dams on public land. Conservative Democrats oppose such intrusions as these, saying that it violates states’ rights to govern trade. More liberal-minded Democrats hold fast that the necessity and potential of Public Works outweigh the risks."

ustates.157.d: "The book An American Dilemma was recently published by Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal. It is an examination of the connection between race and idealism and his thesis on the American Creed. Myrdal was funded by the Carnegie Institute and was chosen for his ambivalence towards American politics. Therefore this report carries with it support from many institutions, and Myrdal, as a result, is invited to the White House for dinner. With him is Ralph Bunche, diplomat and collaborator on this influential book."

ustates.158.d: "The need for the Fair Deal to remedy America's many economic issues is agreed upon in the Republican Party, despite the old guard within the party insisting that Hoover handled it the best he could. An important provision in the Fair Deal is the intervention of federal policy to regulate the market and even prevent bank failure. Several high profile Republicans like Robert Taft oppose stretching executive power even if it could benefit the economy. To counter, Quentin Roosevelt has stated the role of the President to ensure the health of the American people extends to their economy."

Among these are Strom Thurmond and Happy Chandler, long serving congressmen that resist the drift of the Democratic Party towards the political centre. Their Conservative Manifesto is an argument against the long-term effects of the Fair Deal and a restoration of the rights of states.

ustates.161.d: "'This morning I came, I saw and I was conquered, as everyone would be who sees for the first time this great feat of mankind. Ten years ago the place where we are gathered was a sparse, forbidding desert. In the bottom of a gloomy canyon, whose precipitous walls rose to a height of more than a thousand feet, flowed a turbulent, dangerous river. The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun. The site of Boulder City was a cactus-covered waste. The transformation wrought here in these years is a twentieth-century marvel.' Thus begins the president's speech dedicating the creation of Boulder Dam that has finally been completed today."

ustates.164.t: "Railway Nationalization"
ustates.164.d: "One of the Progressive Party's Policies it has sought for some time was a nationalization of the countries Railroads. Now that they have power, the question is how exactly shall railway nationalization go. Congress is debating between two different proposals for how this shall be implemented. The first proposal is that the railroads will be nationalized but not the cars allowing for private businesses to compete among themselves for customers, while the second plan would include the cars in the nationalization. Which version shall Congress go with?"

ustates.168.d: "The recent strife facing America necessitated, in the eyes of many, the creation of a coalition party. Though there is still much work to be done, most of the nation's politicians agree that the country is now stable enough to return to a normal state of affairs. The Coalition ticket has dissolved, making way for the Republicans and Democrats to resume their normal political campaigning, and, eventually, even the development of new political coalitions."
ustates.168.a: "God Bless America"

ustates.169.t: "Liberal Democrats split from the Democratic Party"
ustates.169.d: "The Liberals within the Democratic party have reached a breaking point with party leadership. Those in favour of federal primacy in Fair Deal reforms have called for a caucus of liberal Democrats. The press reported on the declerations made, and have dubbed the attendants 'Liberals' This new name has come to popular usage as of late, and is the informal name of this new breakoff party. Time will tell what this will mean for American politics."
ustates.169.a: "Interesting."

ustates.170.t: "Conservative Democrats split from the Democratic Party"
ustates.170.d: "The conservatives within the Democratic party have for some time been split on the implications of the Fair Deal. Those that believe the Democratic Party is abandoning state soverignity for temporary economic benefit have arranged for their first independent caucus. At first called the Independent Democratic Caucus, the name 'Conservative Party' appears to be more recpetive to the press. Time will tell what this will mean for American politics."
ustates.170.a: "Interesting."

ustates.171.t: "Not Worth a Bucket of Warm Piss"
ustates.171.d: "President John Nance Garner has never had much respect for the Vice Presidency. During the National Convention, Garner refused any oeuvres to take the VP slot for someone else's campaign. Garner's choice of Sam Rayburn came with the implicit understanding that Rayburn's position meant very little to the executive branch. This is why today's newspaper of Rayburn coming out to criticizes Garner for failing to appease radicals was so shocking. Garner responded in interviews that he disregards anything the VP has to say, as 'Rayburn's position isn't worth a bucket of piss.'"

ustates.172.d: "In thanks from the people of Texas, and in recognition for his undying loyalty to the Democratic party, Garner was given a 400-pound hammer this weekend as a gift. President Garner, who is known to slam his gavels so hard that he has broken several in the first year of Presidency alone, is more than pleased with this gift and is assured it will withstand any anger he throws at it."
ustates.172.a: "When all you have is a Hammer."

ustates.173.t: "MacArthur writes An American Caesar"
ustates.173.d: "President MacArthur has come out with an autobiography today chronicling his part in the Crisis of 1936. MacArthur's book speaks of his wise ability to see through Long and Haywood's campaign, and his willingness to do anything to protect democracy. The tense days in Washington are described in great detail, with emphasis placed on the middle class victims of Red Guard and Minutemen attacks. The book also implies, within his chain of command, there were soldiers who advocated marching on Washington to settle the capitoline debates. MacArthur wouldn't name names, but he writes that he personally discouraged the soldiers from going through with this most treasonous plan."
ustates.173.a: "The Savior of Democracy."

ustates.174.t: "Assassins miss MacArthur"
ustates.174.d: "During a meeting today in the National Mall, a shot rang out during MacArthur's speech that nearly caused a stampede of fleeing onlookers. The gun was aimed at President MacArthur by a madman who, once arrested, claimed MacArthur was building a military junta and must be stopped. The ravings of this loon most interestingly have not been traced back to any political group, and it appears to be a lone wolf attempt on the President's life. MacArthur laughed off this ridiculous accusation and has increased the Secret Service's payroll to protect against any more lone wolves."
ustates.174.a: "You can't stop MacArthur."

ustates.175.t: "Reconciliations with The Roosevelts"
ustates.175.d: "The Roosevelt family has been divided ever since the death of Franklin Roosevelt on the eve of his election as Governor of New York. While young Quentin Roosevelt had stayed in partisan politics, albeit as a Republican as opposed to Franklin as a Democrat, Archibald Roosevelt has distanced himself from the family entirely. Rumours of him associating with industrialists and railing against every president since Hoover including Quentin has come to a head. Archibald and Quentin have met to officially bury the hatchet of politics and reunite their family. This meeting also helps to demonstrate Quentin's willingness to reconcilie before punishing dissonance, from friend, foe, and even family member. His magnanimity will not go unnoticed."
ustates.175.a: "Another family reunited."

ustates.176.d: "Westbrook Pegler, that sinister exaggerator, just came out with an article alleging that Willkie is cheating on his wife Edith Willkie with journalist Irita Van Doren. The press have taken to this story and our President is besieged by questions of marital infidelity. Our Press Chief is trying his best at damage control, as well as Irita taking a surprise vacation, but the trustworthiness of Willkie has been damaged."
ustates.176.a: "Damn that Pegler!"

ustates.177.t: "Willkie Addresses NAACP"
ustates.177.d: "President Willkie, despite being a lifelong Democrat, never actively endorsed the Southern Democrat line on race. An early critic of John Nance Garner for failing to appeal to black voters in 1936, Willkie made up for that with a historic speech at the NAACP Convention. Speaking in favour of integration in the military, and also getting a few jabs at Republicans and Democrats for failing to protect black voters from the SPA. His speech ended with a support for Jewish rights to democracy, and forewarned that socialists would target them next if antisemitism reached the levels of racism in America. Democrats in Congress are currently ruminating over how to respond, with most wishing to remain silent until next election season."
ustates.177.a: "Good Ol' Willkie."

ustates.178.t: "Byrd Rails Against National Highway"
ustates.178.d: "The Fair Deal negotiations agree on the main purpose of reform, to fix economic stagnation and reduce unemployment. One provision and its implications so perturbs President Byrd, that a majority of his address to Congress was spent condemning it. That National Highway system, which President Byrd describes as a 'massive waste and an enabler of eminent domain', echoing the Conservative Democratic opposition to any Fair Deal that adds land to the Federal Trust. This position puts Byrd in an interesting cross-section, as some Republicans who see the Highway as overtly anti-dissident as well have joined in his cause."
ustates.178.a: "A Road too Far."

ustates.179.t: "Wallace's Hi-Bred Corn"
ustates.179.d: "Henry Wallace made his fortune in Agronomy, studying under George Washington Carver in university. The breakout success that gave Henry Wallace the ability to pursue politics is the Pioneer Hi-Bred company, a maker of hybrid crops. As president, Wallace has taken his share in Hi-Bred and instructed the Department of Agriculture to disseminate information about hybrid crops, which are beginning to show improvement in water retention over normal crops. The imperative to do this is the ongoing farming disaster in Oklahoma, where dust storms have taken out millions in food. Wallace hopes to solve this issue and save America's food supply."
ustates.179.a: "We do need food."

ustates.180.t: "Taylor's Radical Proposal in Congress"
ustates.180.d: "Out of the several strange requests President Taylor has made over the years, this has to be the hardest to handle. President Taylor has convinced several Progressive Congressmen to revive his old legislation promoting World Unity. Explained as a successor to President Wilson's peace plans he spoke of as the Weltkrieg raged on, World Unity is the preservation of human life and culture and the end of total war. This proposal in Congress was of course defeated, but the gesture has surprisingly boosted President Taylor's reputation."
ustates.180.a: "We All Hope For Peace."

ustates.181.t: "Taylor Takes the Stage Nationwide"
ustates.181.d: "One of the many eccentric qualities of President Taylor is his singing career. From his time singing to children on the steps of the Capitol building to now singing in front of his millions of constituents. President Taylor has leveraged what would have made him a laughing stock in politics into a genuine expression of his patriotism in art. Taylor sings to promote unity in America over politics, and cooperation instead of victory."
ustates.181.a: "Sing On, Jim!"

ustates.182.t: "Barkley Ends The Corvee System"
ustates.182.d: "A division appears between President Barkley and the Democratic Party on Fair Deal Infrastructure. A Congressional debate brought up the idea of allowing a smaller community works to be paid by the government, with repair being handled by the Corvée system. The Corvée system is a tax imposed to pay for prisoners to repair public works. President Barkley spoke out against this idea, as his time in Kentucky taught him that penal labour will never surpass contract labour. This stand also puts pressure on Southern Democrats in his own party that support a state-financed and cheap reconstruction plan. National attention to the Corvée system has led to most states outlawing it."
ustates.182.a: "Rightfully So."

ustates.183.t: "Russell's Chain Gang Labor Exposed"
ustates.183.d: "Richard Russell's career in Georgia prior to the White House wasn't without its controversy. As a cost-cutting measure, Russell authorized the use of penal labour to undertake constructions for the state. This free labour was compounded by poor living conditions and has eventually come back to haunt Russell. A former prisoner who had his conviction overturned has written a book entitled 'I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!'. This book describes a corrupt penal system and puts the blame on now-President Russell. Those critical of the President are having a field day with this. Rumours of Hollywood planning a movie on this book have also circulated."

Gangsters, sent by the Dutch Schultz to avenge his upcoming execution tried shooting at him through the windows. Fortunately, the Secret Service was able to hide President Dewey, and nabbed the gangsters responsible. As a result, Dewey has doubled his security and pressed for further crackdowns nationwide on crime syndicates, as this attempt may encourage copycats. Both Democrat and Republican in Congress have called J Edgar Hoover into Congress to explain how the FBI did not see this coming.

Fortunately, the Secret Service was able to hide President Landon, and nabbed the gangsters responsible. As a result, Landon has doubled his security and pressed for further crackdowns nationwide on crime syndicates, as this attempt may encourage copycats.

The Olson household revealed that he had died from stomach cancer that had recurred. This comes as a shock, as many had believed his cancer was cured. Olson, nicknamed "Skipper", steered the nation through the civil war against leftist agitators and reactionary despots, and saved the union like the great Lincoln before him. Hundreds of thousands came to watch his casket at the state capital, and later was driven to Washington D.C before being laid to rest at a quiet Minnesota funeral home."

### election stuff ###

ustates.190.t: "The Upcoming Election"
ustates.190.d.progs: "It has been almost four years since George Norris took office, and though he began his term residing over a collapsing nation, he was able to act quickly and prevent a Civil War from breaking out. While the Norris-Roosevelt ticket is wildly popular among the Progressive base, his re-election is not guaranteed. Four years ago, after tense negotiations, Huey Long and Jack Reed endorsed the Progressive Party, and they may hold the key to it's re-election chances. Securing their support will be vital. Meanwhile, it appears that ideological struggles will characterize this year's Democratic and Republican primaries. Those who agree with many of Norris's reforms argue that embracing some of them is the only way to beat the Progressives in November, while those who vehemently oppose the Square Deal argue that making their own policy arguments is the only way to win. Even if the parties haven't decided how to run against Norris, it is clear he has made an enemy in the media. Whatever Norris does, it seems that the newspapers cover it unfavorably, and this may pose a problem for him in the election. Regardless though, both Norris and Roosevelt have signaled their enthusiasm for continuing their work in office, and hope to usher the U.S. into a new age of prosperity."
ustates.190.d.landon: "In just a few years, President Alf Landon has reversed the dismal fortunes of the Republican Party handed to him by Herbert Hoover. The Landon Plan has differed from Hoover's approach mainly in that Landon blames tariffs for America's economic woes, and hence has pursued a more free-trade approach. While this plan, in addition to domestic stimulus programs, has largely helped Americans recover, there is no guarantee the Republicans will be re-elected in November. It is a rare thing in American politics to see one party be elected four consecutive times, and the country has certainly changed from the days of Hoover's first term. The insurgent third parties that ran in 1936 have largely dissipated, yet their leaders are still influential, and they have focused their critiques on the impact of Landon's trade policies. Long and Reed have lambasted Landon for policies they insist have hurt farmers and workers at the benefit of corporations, while Murray has argued that Landon's policies only benefit the cosmopolitan elite class. Meanwhile, while the Progressives have largely echoed the critiques of Reed and Long, the Democrats have crafted their own message, painting Landon as an out-of-touch Easern elitist who couldn't hope to understand the plight of the everyday American. The results of such criticisms are yet to be seen, but it is clear that Landon may have a tough season ahead of him."
ustates.190.d.curtis: "President Charles Curtis has successfully administered the country's recovery during his challenging term in office, and now he looks to re-election. Curtis's "Work Sharing Plan", along with his stimulus programs, have been just what America's economy has needed to get back on track. His success has made him popular, but Curtis faces hurdles in the way of his re-election. For one thing, the insurgent parties from the last election have largely disappeared, but their leaders have not. Reed and Long have criticized Curtis's programs for being pro-worker on  the surface only, and representing business interests in truth. Meanwhile, Murray has characterized Curtis's reforms as a capitulation to syndicalists. The mainstream Democrats, after years of failure on the national level, are experincing a struggle for the soul of the party, with reform-minded liberals hoping to take control of the party and the still-mighty conservatives hoping to retain power. Regardless of their faction though, nearly all Democrats have criticized Curtis's programs as tyrannical and violating the rights of states and the terms agreed on in the "Home Rule Negotiations". Curtis has a difficult election ahead of him, but with any luck, he will lead the party to victory once again."
ustates.190.d.garner: "John Nance Garner has beaten every political enemy he has faced in his first term in office, but new ones have risen to challenge his power. Largely seen as a humble and unassuming man, Garner is a political intriguer in reality, often making backroom deals to achieve his goals. His program of "Austerity through the Storm" as well as the political strategy of repressing the leftist radicals of the North and Midwest has been successful, and order has finally been restored to a battered nation. However, the battle is not yet over for Garner. If he wants to win re-election, he will have to deal with leaders of the now-defunct ODP party, who still hold sway over millions of voters and who are bitter at their treatment in recent years. At the same time, many ODP voters have switched over to the Democratic Party, where they have traditionally been, and even much of the ODP leadership has complimented Garner's emphasis on rooting out syndicalism in the country. Still, there is much ground to be covered before official reunification of the two Democratic factions is achieved. In the meantime, while Reed and Long have been silenced, the Republican Party is as strong as ever, marshaling the outrage of northerners and coastal elites against what they see as a dirty, simple, and crass man who is unfit to be president. It is this hatred by northeastern elites in particular that may trouble Garner in his re-election, and the Catholics who voted for him in the last election may be less excited for his second term after his adoption of some ODP anti-Catholic rhetoric. Further, the party machines in that region of the country, dissatisfied by Garner's lack of civility and his sheer conservatism, will surely drag their feet in mobilizing urban Democrats. Many of these elites look down on Garner, and already predict a Republican victory in November. For his part, Garner is determined to show the world just how wrong they are, and he is confident the party can achieve victory. Time will tell whether he is correct, however..."
ustates.190.d.deadlocknorris: "It has been nearly four years since the last election, yet the wounds left from that disaster have not healed. When it became clear that no candidate had secured enough support to win outright, the House of Representatives chose the leader of the country for the second time in a row. George Norris and Quentin Roosevelt were decided on as a compromise ticket, a move that most congressmen saw as magnanimous, as they actually despised Norris's platform. The decision was only made in an effort to appease Longists, Syndicalists, and Progressives themselves, whose combined vote tally surpassed that of the Republicans and Democrats. However, the decision to make him president was not received well by the nation's right-wing, particularly the ODP and the South as a whole. The Democratic Party, after years of losses and ineffectiveness, has lost most of its old base, who have flocked to the ODP instead. Even worse, William Murray has convinced millions nationwide to join him in forming a new "National People's Party". With its new support, the party poses a true threat to Norris's re-election chances. Norris has turned out to be an effective president, acting quickly to prevent a collapse and even helping the nation to recover from the Great Depression, but with a weak Republican Party and an insurgent National People's Party, can he hang on?" 
ustates.190.d.deadlockgarner: "When the House of Representatives chose a president for the second time in a row, the decision was not well-received among the nation's left-wing. The House chose their former speaker, Democrat John Nance Garner, and his running mate Al Smith to win the election. The decision was made in the hopes that Garner would eliminate some of the more radical elements in the country while also having an established record in Washington. Further, Garner earned more votes than any other candidate, but it was still not enough to win outright. In his first term, Garner has been able to successfully defuse the national tension before armed conflict broke out, and also save the economy from ruin. However, he has not been as successful on the political front. The House's decision to select another president was most bitterly denounced by Huey Long and Jack Reed. The two have begun their own party in the time since the election, calling it the Populist Party in a nod to the old party of the same name. They have grown to a size that will make them Garner's main opponent in November, with the increasingly irrelevant Republican Party posing little challenge. Can Garner hang on against the Republicans and the insurgent Populist Party?"

ustates.195.t: "The First Convention Speech"
ustates.195.d.pp: "The Populist Party convention is raucous already, and it will be up to the first speaker to gain the attention of the crowd and calm everyone down. Both Reed and Long have put forward their preferences for who the first speaker should be, but the decision has still not been made, and a last minute pick will have to suffice. It would be best to have the first be a good orator  but not a firebrand so as to not take the wind out of the sails of those to follow, and two options have been pushed from each side. \n\nReed originally pushed for Eugene Dennis to give the first speech, but this was met with firm resistance from the anti-socialists within the Longist camp. His next offer was William Green, the more moderate union leader, who would be also be a more satisfying choice for the Long camp, though Green's rival John L. Lewis was seen to leave the convention in a fury after the name was suggested. \n\nFrom the Longist camp, the first suggestion was Robert LaFollette Jr., brother of Wisconsin Governor Philip LaFollette. Off the back of a number of disputes with his brother, and his appointment as the administrator of  "Share our Wealth" in the Great Lakes region, "Young Bob" has stepped out of Philip’s shadow to become the champion of a distinctly Mid-Western brand of Longism. Given these credentials, few were surprised when Reed strongly opposed giving the floor to LaFollette Jr. What did come as a shock was his suggestion that perhaps Philip LaFollette should speak instead. While Governor LaFollette is no friend of Reed, he was also once considered a rival for Long in dominating the hearts and minds of much of Middle America, and as such, he is likely to be tepid in his support of the Longist wing of the party. \n\nAs the crowd continues to grow wilder, the moment has now come to decide which of these four men will open the convention."
ustates.195.d.npp: "The National People’s Party convention is raucous already, and it will be up to the first speaker to gain the attention of the crowd and calm everyone down. Murray and Lindbergh have been with grappling with the various options for who the first speaker should be, but the decision has still not been made, and a last minute pick will have to suffice. It would be best to have the first be a good orator, but not a firebrand, so as to not take the wind out of the sails of those to follow, and two options have been pushed from each side. \n\nLindbergh originally pushed for his ally, famous industrialist Henry Ford, to give the first speech, but this was met with strong opposition from the populists in Murray’s camp. His next offer was William Randolph Hearst Jr., largely due to his father’s contributions in bringing the NPP to the attention of the American public. \n\nFrom Murray’s camp, the initial nomination was Gerald L. K. Smith, the radical Christian and populist. Though once aligned with Long’s AFP, Smith broke with them after their left-ward turn towards Norris, preferring to focus more firmly on campaigning for Christian and anti-Semitic positions. Smith has thus come to be aligned with the NPP, even if he has not fully been accepted by them. To no one’s surprise, Lindbergh and Hearst both voiced their firm opposition to giving the pulpit to a man who once coordinated Share Our Wealth efforts. Murray’s compromise suggestion was something of a surprise, as he nominated Samuel Green, Georgia native and one of the most prominent leaders of the much diminished Ku Klux Klan. Though the KKK remains mired in controversy, Green is a middle-class professional with a reputation for rejecting some of the flamboyancy of previous Klan leaders, a fact that has gained his embattled organization some support within respectable society.\n\nAs the crowd continues to grow wilder, the moment has now come to decide which of these four men will open the convention."

The time has now come for a second speech, which is intended to emphasize the extensive support of the Populist Party Tthrough an endorsement by an important political figure. \n\nAs a result, the options for speakers consist of the various men who have given their endorsement to the party thus far. While all of these men have their own agendas and stand independently of Long or Reed, they can also be seen as aligned with a particular wing of the Populist Party.  As a result, giving the podium to these men is likely to strengthen the position of their respective factions in the party, and would signal a turn in a particular direction to the rest of the world. \n\nBoth Reed and Long are fighting fiercely for their preferred speaker, and as time runs out, someone must be found, one way or another."

As both Long and Reed expect that this speech will be decisive in determining who will be chosen as the presidential nominee, they are fighting tooth and nail to have their firmest supporter take the stage.

While Reed’s prior 1936 run as candidate of the SPA failed, he dominated the Steel Belt and the ports of the East Coast, and many believe that now he is at the head of a party with organizational and grass-roots support in Middle America, his chances for victory may be better than ever."

While Lindbergh has never run for the presidency before, he was a candidate for the ODP in the New Jersey senatorial race, and established himself one of the party’s most prominent members in the lead-up to the 1936 election. Put together with his status as a famed aviator, media attention and high society background, Lindbergh’s name is omnipresent in American culture, a fact which looks like it may well bear him electoral success."

Several options have now been tabled, each of whom represents more moderate but nonetheless distinct ideological currents within the party. Strong arguments have been made for each, and it looks like anyone of them may end up being chosen by the party. \n\nThe first choice is Norman Thomas, perennial SPA candidate and the leading figure of the moderate Socialist current within the PP. The second is Paul Maloney, Louisiana Democrat turned AFP member and one of the few Longist leaders not directly connected to the Long family. Finally, there is Californian Utopian, Upton Sinclair. A populist with a Western image, Folsom represents the appeal of Socialism without some of its radical baggage, while his ties in California may help gain the party support in the conservative West.\n\nAs time drags on, the PP must soon find an ideology and candidate, both to present to the convention, and to unite the fractured party.

Strong arguments have been made for each, and it looks like anyone of them may end up being chosen by the party. \n\nThe first choice is Richard Russell Jr., the Georgian senator, and one of the leaders of the moderate faction of what used to be the Old Democratic Party. While not opposed to segregation, Russell’s support for poverty relief and modernization programs have won him acclaim among many populists. The second is Eugen Talmadge, the Klan endorsed arch-segregationist and herald of laissez-faire economics, behind whom some of the Fordist who previously backed Lindbergh have thrown their weight. Finally there is Bibb Graves, the former Governor of Alabama. While more closely aligned with the KKK than Russell, Graves is also committed to modernization and reform, with the intent of bringing the South into the industrial age through policies imposed from the top-down. As a result, he has received the endorsement of members of the Klan Machine, populists and Fordists alike, who see in him a strong leader capable of both directing a successful campaign and undoing many of the policies brought about by the Progressives. \n\nAs time drags on, the NPP must soon decide on one of the faction’s candidates, both to present to the convention, and to unite the fractured party.

Despite holding the dubious reputation of being the most well-known advocate for Totalism in America, Browder now states that he now intends to demonstrate how his brand of Socialism can not only save America, but that his ideology is in fact as American as apple pie. \n\nHaving since managed to secure the grudging support of Jack Reed and even some of the more leftist proponents of Longism, it looks like Browder’s position is presently secure.

Formerly associated with the right of the AFP, Pelley broke with Long’s organization amid controversial circumstances. He has since aligned himself with Gerald L. K.

ustates.272.a: "Then it shall be war."
ustates.272.b: "We shall bide our time."

ustates.273.t: "[From.GetNameDef] Asks for Alaska"
ustates.273.t.attu: "[From.GetNameDef] Asks for Attu Island"
ustates.273.d: "With the civil war now over, [From.GetNameDef] has decided to ask for the return of Alaska. We had seized it to protect our interests, but with [From.GetNameDef]'s victory in the civil war, they - as the claimant to American legitimacy - are asking for Alaska to be returned. Their ambassador has stressed that war is rather likely if we refuse. What shall our response be?"

ustates.276.a: "Rejoin America(game over)"
ustates.276.b: "Do not Rejoin America."

ustates.2760.t: "The United States wants Texas to rejoin America"
ustates.2760.d: "The Americans are asking for Texas to rejoin America. Their ambassador has indicated that if this does not happen that the US will return with military force to reclaim their territory. Furthermore, this US government is not the same weak, divisive one that betrayed us before their civil war and appears committed to democratic principles just like us and is promising full statehood immediately. What shall we do?"
ustates.2760.a: "Rejoin America(Play as the USA)"
ustates.2760.b: "They betrayed us once, and they could betray us again."

ustates.285.a: "Thank you Dr. Salk."

### Military stuff ###

ustates.300.t: "Military Research"
ustates.300.d: "We are having our best scientists and business leaders look into what we should invest our efforts into guns, artillery, tanks, our improving our own doctrines. What should we choose?"
ustates.300.a: "Modernize our Guns."
ustates.300.b: "Modernize our Artillery."
ustates.300.c: "Modernize our Tanks."
ustates.300.e: "Modernize our Doctrines."

ustates.301.t: "Full Utilization of Force"
ustates.301.d: "The aftermath of the Second Civil War has given us time to assess not only the holes in our military capabilities, but potential improvements as well. Our General Staff has determined that we can outpace conventional engine based aeroplanes with the new fuel and thrust tech developed by Lawrence Bell. At the same time, we have procured enough engineers and scientists for Neddermeyer's idea for a plutonium gun nuclear weapon."
ustates.301.a: "Lawrence Bell's Jet."
ustates.301.b: "Oppenheimer's Atom Bomb."
ustates.301.c: "Authorize more funds for both."

ustates.302.t: "Albuquerque Project"
ustates.302.d: "Bell's X project has proceeded satisfactorily, with a successful implementation of rocket technology into planes being able to double the speed of older aircraft. Brave test pilot Jack Woolams today was the first person to fly the plane faster than 741 miles per hour, breaking the sound barrier."
ustates.302.a: "Prepared for even Interplanetary War."

ustates.303.t: "Winchester Project"
ustates.303.d: "The project ran into a significant problem when it was discovered that the nuclear material Plutonium has a fission rate too fast for a bullet. The solution came in the form of depleted Uranium initially planned for a different nuclear project. This makes the weapon barely ethical under normal nuclear waste usage guidelines, and creates the issue of intentional biological damage from radiation on the target. Nonetheless, the Thin Man is a success"
ustates.303.a: "We are safe from Oppenheimer's deadly toy."

ustates.304.t: "The War and Peace Studies"
ustates.304.d: "In the past, our diplomatic conduct has been at the whim of ambassadors, many of whom had bought their positions from the party. The world we live in is too dangerous to afford such flippant choices to be made by agents of America, it is General MacArthur's opinion that a new approach to foreign policy is necessary, one that derives consensus from a group of trusted experts. This is what inspired the War and Peace Studies, a calling for only the brightest to represent America in this brave new world. This entity, the so-called the Council on Foreign Relations, will advise General MacArthur on how to suppress radical forces from any corner of the world."
ustates.304.a: "Constrained by diplomats no more."

ustates.305.t: "The White House and Xanadu"
ustates.305.d: "A surprising amount of support came from the pages of the many Hearst Newspapers that dot America. These papers drew up the image of MacArthur as the heroic Cincinnatus, hearing the call to save the Republic from certain destruction. A beacon for MacArthur's allies and the creation of an almost mythical personage through films and newspaper cartoons, Hearst has served as a stabilizing factor to the ship of the state. Even Hearst's attacks on radical unions and populists seemed to echo the words of MacArthur's radio speeches."
ustates.305.a: "We appreciate your support."

ustates.306.t: "The New Normal in America"
ustates.306.d: "When General MacArthur announced that he would not step down as leader those years ago, it was under the pretence of emergency. At the time. hundreds of thousands of Americas were unaccounted for, radicals prowled the countryside funding their politics with looted money, and the democratic pillar was unready to hold up the state. These past few years have seen a great many galvanize into hardy MacArthurites, and a new flavour of politician has emerged in the House of Representatives. These Congressmen see the need for an integral military role to check and nurture the business environment and ensure the rights of citizens cannot be infringed due to gridlock."
ustates.306.a: "Endorse the new supporters."
ustates.306.b: "Refuse this congressional oeuvre."

ustates.307.t: "Into the Wild Blue Yonder"
ustates.307.d: "While the United States has an air force, the capability to defend the skies and project power, we do not have an Air Force. The role is split between the US Army in service of our Paratroopers, and the US Navy aboard our Aircraft Carriers. The contention the General Staff addresses today is the ultimate fate of the Air Force, and to which branch should tradition take after. Those in favour of the Army contend that future operations will most likely be in ground support or air drops, while Navy advocates claim that Aircraft are essential to the future of Naval Warfare in engagements large and small. We must choose a side."
ustates.307.a: "The Air Force belongs to the Army."
ustates.307.b: "The Air Force belongs to the Navy."
ustates.307.c: "The Air Force Belongs to itself."

ustates.308.t: "Super-weapons on a budget"
ustates.308.d: "In the last few years, our military research has focused on the potential for internal conflict, narrowing our focus and budget for longer-term projects. This years' Congressional Budget has fortunately found some money to allocate to a long-term project. Three plans are presented to the military high command to meet and exceed the military projects of our rivals. The first is a rocket by Goddard theoretically capable of delivering explosives from miles away without risking pilot lives. The second is Oppenheimer's planned theoretical bomb using radioactive heavy metals as researched in Austria and Germany. The third is a much cheaper plan as proposed by the eccentric Wilhelm Reich, he claims that a bomb can be made much cheaper using his own personal physics research. On our part, we don't know much about what Wilhelm Reich is talking about, but his reputation in Austria gives us some comfort into whatever science he's using."
ustates.308.a: "Goddard's Rocket."
ustates.308.b: "Oppenheimer's Bomb."
ustates.308.c: "Reich's Bomb."

ustates.309.t: "Goddard's Successful Launch"
ustates.309.d: "At home again in Roswell, New Mexico, Goddard again goes to launch test rockets. The last time he was here, the rockets were smaller than his thigh, and reached only a thousand feet in height. Now the rockets soar miles over the desert and touch down with their dummy weights. Goddard's refusal to detonate explosive rockets on the Continental United States prevent the full scale of the damage to be known."
ustates.309.a: "Good boy Goddard."

ustates.310.t: "Oppenheimer's Bomb a Success"
ustates.310.d: "An invitation by Oppenheimer was sent out to nuclear researchers, physicists, and engineers throughout Europe. The promise of escaping persecution in Europe has resounded most strongly to Jewish scientists, some of whom emigrated to the US for the project. After a year and a half of experimentation and some cooperation with colleagues in Europe, a working atomic bomb is ready to be tested. The skies of Alamogordo New Mexico lit up in a flash of destruction as the test bomb Valediction exploded. Oppenheimer later said that the bomb was named after his favourite John Donne poem."
ustates.310.a: "The breath goes now."

ustates.311.t: "Reich's Failed Explosion"
ustates.311.d: "After many delays and several attempts to obfuscate the general staff, Wilhelm Reich's bomb project is discontinued and millions of dollars wasted on bunk. This became apparent to Reich's observers when tests showing his energy, named Orgone, could induce exothermic reactions that only he and his associates could see. The bomb itself being a hollow shell with layers of metals covering that never did explode, save for its collapse when Reich attempted to destroy it during the investigation. This embarrassment is currently making its rounds in the papers."
ustates.311.a: "Not our proudest moment."

ustates.312.t: "The Patriot Party?"
ustates.312.d: "With MacArthur holding onto power many allies such as Rockefeller, Kennan, Sutherland and the American Legion leadership is advising us to organize our supporters under a unified political party, rather than simply having known supporters of the military government. While it would take some getting used to, The Patriot Party would greatly aid in our efforts."
ustates.312.a: "Found the Party"
ustates.312.b: "A Party is not needed"

ustates.3120.t: "Courting Dissenting Generals"
ustates.3120.d: "Though most of our generals either agree with or have ignored our new junta system, but there are a few voices who have spoke up. Edwin F. Harding and Lloyd Fredendall, both of them men who were close to the traitor George Marshall, are the most prominent dissenters, and we should try to address their concerns. This could be done by a transfer of money or positions, or by giving them positions outside the Committee. What shall we do?"
ustates.3120.a: "Offer them bribes."
ustates.3120.b: "Grant them minor positions."

ustates.3121.t: "Bring King into the Committee?"
ustates.3121.d: "Ernest J. King is one of MacArthur's most loyal military officials, and his grip over the U.S. Navy should not be underestimated. Partly to reward his loyalty and partly to get the support of the navy, some of our advisors recommend that we allow King a spot in the Committee alongside the various generals that have seats. However, others argue for army purity within the Committee, and this could have benefits as well. Should we bring King into the fold?"
ustates.3121.a: "Give him a spot."
ustates.3121.b: "Keep the Committee pure."

ustates.3122.t: "Republican Party Convention"
ustates.3122.d: "In the wake of MacArthur's near-dictatorship, Congress wants a candidate they can control in the White House. The best way they can see this being done is by choosing someone from among their own, who has considerable experience and will not rock the boat. An older, more malleable candidate would be preferred, if possible. For the Republicans, the party is looking to two men in particular. Bertrand Snell is fairly conservative for a Republican, and dislikes the policies of Hoover and Curtis, even though he agrees with their lissez-faire principles. John Taber has served as a New York representative for over ten years, and is fairly unexciting, which is exactly what congressional Republicans are looking for. Which of these two men should be the party's nominee?"
ustates.3122.a: "Bertrand Snell"
ustates.3122.b: "John Taber"

ustates.3123.t: "Democratic Party Convention"
ustates.3123.d: "In the wake of MacArthur's near-dictatorship, Congress wants a candidate they can control in the White House. The best way they can see this being done is by choosing someone from among their own, who has considerable experience and will not rock the boat. An older, more malleable candidate would be preferred, if possible. For the Democrats, the party has two men for the job. Carter Glass is an experienced senator from Virginia whose old age perhaps makes him unlikely for a two-term candidate, but a perfect one for a congressional restoration and return of security, especially given his conservatism. Sam Rayburn, who is a protege of former Democratic nominee John Nance Garner, has a long history in Congress, and has proven his loyalty to the party time and again. Both men would be fairly easy to control, but the question is, which of these two men should be the party's nominee?"
ustates.3123.a: "Carter Glass"
ustates.3123.b: "Sam Rayburn"

ustates.3124.t: "The [GetYear] Presidential Election"
ustates.3124.d: "Polls have just closed in the [GetYear] election, after a long day of voting. Results have just started to come in, and winning the White House is..."

ustates.3125.d.Leahy: "Polls have just closed in the [GetYear] election, after a long day of voting. Results have just started to come in, and winning the Federal part of the joint USA-PSA election is..."
ustates.3125.a: "The Progressive Party."
ustates.3125.b: "The Republican Party."
ustates.3125.c: "The Democratic Party."

ustates.3125.f: "The Republican Party."
ustates.3125.g: "The Democratic Party."

ustates.3126.t: "[GetYear] Progressive Convention"
ustates.3126.d: "Though they have been greatly weakened by the Civil War, the Progressives still cling to life and hope to win the presidency now that [USA.GetLeader] has stepped down. The main candidates running are George Norris, who hopes to have better results this time around, and Quentin Roosevelt, the rising Progressive who hopes to continue the legacy of his father. There is also little known Henry Temple, a loyal Pennsylvania Progressive serving in the House of Representatives. His effort is a longshot, but perhaps he could serve as a compromise between the two main candidates. Who will lead our party?"

ustates.3127.d: "The Republican Party is in shambles after Hoover's presidency and recent years, but now that [USA.GetLeader] has stepped down, party leaders are hoping to rebuild. Theodore Roosevelt Jr. is running to be this year's nominee, and challenging him are John Bricker and Arthur Vandenberg, both respected and influential politicians in their own right. All of them are fairly similar in their staunch adherence to the principles of Hoover, despite differing from him in how they want to implement these policies. Their hopes of truly implementing a laissez-faire system can only be achieved if they win the presidency, and whether or not that is possible is yet to be seen. However, Republicans are hopeful that they are the party to put the country back together again. Who shall lead our party?"

ustates.3127.e: "Alf Landon"

ustates.3128.t: "[GetYear] Democratic Convention"
ustates.3128.d: "The Democratic Party of Garner is no longer the same party. The tidal waves of Murray and his ODP, the Civil War, and Garner's own failures in 1936 have left the party wide open. Several men are expected to contend for the leadership of the party this cycle. Happy Chandler, a representative of the conservative wing of the party, has a bitter rivalry with Alben W. Barkley, who is more liberally minded. Their animosity for one another will surely cause sparks in the primary, but there are other candidates as well. Adlai Stevenson, though he agrees more with Barkley on most issues, has chosen to stay out of their rivalry and instead present himself as a youthful and hopeful option for the Democratic Party, one who could lead them to a more successful future. Martin Dies Jr., a Texas Democrat in the style of Garner, is also running as a conservative Democrat, and hopes to win the support of former Garner voters and perhaps continue the traditions of the party as they were before 1936. It is yet to be seen which of these men will prevail. Who will be our nominee?"

ustates.3129.t: "Committee Appointments: Malin Craig"
ustates.3129.d: "The process to begin appointing committee members besides the original three (MacArthur, Eisenhower, and Bradley) has begun. Candidates from both groups are being considered, and while some are supported unanimously, others are more controversial with one side or the other, for various reasons. The first nominee up for consideration is Malin Craig. Craig's high ranking status in the military and his loyal to the United States make him a popular choice with both MacArthur and the WCC generals. Further, his stated neutrality in the earlier tensions between the USA and WCC means both sides can see him as a potential ally within the committee. It is certain he will have a place on the Committee."
ustates.3129.a: "Appoint Craig"

ustates.3130.t: "Committee Appointments: Ord/Kenney or Wainwright/Truscott?"
ustates.3130.d: "The coming candidates to be appointed on the Committee are more controversial than Craig was. Eisenhower has personally vouched for George Kenney, whereas Bradley would like to see James Garesche Ord on the Committee. For his part, MacArthur has insisted that the lesser-known Lucian Truscott and Jonathan M. Wainwright, men he views as his closest advisors, be appointed instead. If we fail to appoint his choices, he has threatened to hold up the whole proccess for days. Who should we pick?"
ustates.3130.a: "Appoint Ord and Kenney"
ustates.3130.b: "Appoint Wainwright and Truscott"

ustates.3131.t: "Committee Appointments: Roosevelt/Gerow or Lee/Huebner?"
ustates.3131.d: "The next set of nominees under consideration are likely to favor the WCC generals. War hero Archibald Roosevelt and personal friend of Eisenhower, Leonard Gerow, have been proposed as candidates on the WCC side. MacArthur and his advisors have pushed for John C. H. Lee and Clarence Huebner, both war heroes in their own right, but they can't compare to the celebrity status of Roosevelt and Eisenhower's preference for Gerow. Failing to appoint the WCC nominees may result in a stall in negotiations, but the process is expected to continue nonetheless."
ustates.3131.a: "Appoint Roosevelt and Gerow"
ustates.3131.b: "Appoint Lee and Huebner"

ustates.3132.t: "Committee Appointments: Daniel Van Voorhis"
ustates.3132.d: "The last nominee under consideration for a seat on the Committee is Daniel Van Voorhis. Voorhis has had a long career in the army and possess significant skill in armored warfare, something that made him an invaluable asset to the U.S. military during the Civil War. Now, both sides wish to see him on the Committee, and his appointment is expected to be relatively uncontroversial."
ustates.3132.a: "Appoint Voorhis"

ustates.3133.t: "The Nature of Congress"
ustates.3133.d: "The time has come to decide what Congress will look like in the future. We can decide to appoint new members through the Committee, or maintain elections. These elections would be controlled by us of course, as it is not the voter that matters, but he who counts the votes. Still, it might just be easier to do away with these elections entirely and appoint loyal congressmen ourselves. Should we maintain an image of democracy or aim for a more directly controllable Congress?"
ustates.3133.a: "Appoint them through the Committee"
ustates.3133.b: "Hold sham elections"

ustates.3134.t: "Eastern Red Belt District"
ustates.3134.d: "The states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York shall fall under the jurisdiction of this district.

Our Progressive Party was only able to win with their support, and now that we are in power, we should begin official negotiations with the many former AFP leaders seeking a new beginning. Wherever they go, their supporters are likely to follow. However, it is a near certainty that they will demand concessions, specifically implementation of harsher inheritance taxes, limits on yearly income, and government preservation of surplus agricultural goods. We have arranged a meeting in New Orleans, where Robert La Follette Jr. and Earl Kemp Long will meet with former party standardbearer George W. Norris to discuss these ideas and more."
ustates.3147.d.replibs: "After rigorous strategic talks, President [USA.GETLeader] and other Republican leaders have decided to reach out to former Longist leaders with the goal of building a coalition. Many Longists voted for our party in the recent election, and gaining the support of their leadership as well can only help us. Though Long and many of his supporters were once Democrats, any love they had for the party is gone, and we believe they could be courted given the right conditions. There are also many who were once progressive Republicans, and seeing the party's return to such values, would be more than willing to rejoin. In any case, they will surely be wary of working with a major party, and will demand concessions before any agreement is made. This will likely take the shape of a watered-down "Share the Wealth" program. We have arranged a meeting in New Orleans, where William Borah, the elderly progressive Republican known as the "Lion of Idaho", will meet with Robert La Follette Jr. and Earl Kemp Long to discuss a deal."
ustates.3147.d.demlibs: "After careful consideration, President [USA.GETLeader] and other Democratic leaders have decided to reach out to former Longist leaders in the hopes of building a coalition. Longists played a key role in our recent victory in the election, and bringing their leaders into the fold will only increase their support for us. Many of the AFP's leaders were once Democrats themselves, and these men will be easier to court than their Northern Republican counterparts. In any case, we won't impress any of them without the offer of some concessions, particularly around their "Share the Wealth" program. Specifically, we think they will demand pensions for the elderly, free education, and increased taxes on the wealth to pay for their programs.

ustates.3148.d.progs: "The Socialist Party of America was demonized by other factions during the Civil War and its members are largely seen as extremists. However, we know there is more nuance to the organization. From social democrats to syndicalists to democratic socialists and even totalists, the party is extremely diverse. Regardless, many of their former supporters in the Red Belt joined our winning coalition in the last election, and in fact were one of our biggest constituencies. Without them, we would not have won. However, we should reach out to their leadership as well, in the hopes of officially coming together as a political force. This will not be easy, and they are certain to demand concessions. Specifically, it seems they will ask for empowered unions, a universal income, and increased wages for workers. We have arranged a meeting in Chicago, where Robert Ferdinand Wagner will negotiate with William B. Green and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. Whispers of this meeting have found their way to Democratic and Republican ears, and it seems they are making coalition efforts of their own, to counteract our increasing strength..."
ustates.3148.d.replibs: "Traditionally, the Midwest has been a Republican stronghold. With the rise of syndicalism in America, the party lost its foothold in the region, and the rest is history. However, in the recent election, it seems that our progressive message won over many former SPA members, many of whom were Republicans once. If we can solidify this constituency, we will have a certain advantage in the electoral college for years to come, given that the Red Belt states have high electoral college vote counts. Before we can be sure of their loyalty though, we should speak to some of their leaders. Preliminary attempts to negotiate have shown them to be tough negotiators, and we will likely have to choose between them and the few wealthy patrons we have left. Regardless, we have arranged for a meeting in Chicago, where the young but talented Harold Stassen will meet with Norman Thomas and James P. Cannon to discuss terms. It is already clear that such a meeting is making Democrats nervous, and it seems they are holding parallel negotiations to bring the ODP back into their party..."
ustates.3148.d.demlibs: "President [USA.GETLeader], after studying the recent electoral map, has decided it is essential to appeal to leftist voters in the Red Belt if the party is to continue its streak of success. Given the actions of the Democratic Party only twenty years ago, some of his advisors are shocked at the mere suggestion, but most agree that it is a necessary action. While the voters themselves supported us as the best progressive option last election, the leadership has been reluctant to support us. Surely they will want to guarantee that we are sincere in our promises of policy concessions, and they will demand quite a bit from us. What we decide to compromise on will be decided at the meeting, but we are confident that Illinois politician Adlai Stevenson has the necessary skills to bring them into the fold. He will meet with Daniel Hoan and Matthew Woll to discuss terms soon. In the meantime, it seems that the Republicans are also going out of their comfort zone, looking to appeal to right-wing voters in the South and elsewhere..."

However, we were able to win the last election by stealing enough Democratic votes in the South and finding others elsewhere, and we should continue this strategy. This "Southern Strategy" will require more than us being the more conservative option, however. We will need to conduct serious outreach to voters and party leaders in the South who swore their loyalty to the Constitutional American Republic during the Civil War. It is a process that will take time, but we are confident it is a worthwhile investment. The ODP leaders will demand concessions however, including crackdowns on leftists and legislation to guarantee states rights to govern themselves. What such things would look like will depend on our negotiators, who will meet with ODP leaders in Atlanta soon. Ray Lyman Wilbur Sr. will meet with John Elliot Rankin and Charles Lindbergh to secure a deal. This meeting is sure to make the Democrats nervous, however..."
ustates.3149.d.demcons: "The Democratic Party, once a mighty force, has suffered blow after blow in recent years. Most recently, the party split in half, and the resulting Civil War devastated the party. However, now that the war is over and we have found success yet again, we should try to mend the party. Democrats who joined the ODP and fought for Murray during the Civil War came back to support us in the recent election, and we should make sure they do not abandon us again. To do so, we will need to negotiate with the ODP leaders, and their demands will be harsh. However, we are willing to do what we must to secure their support. They have asked for concessions varying from the elimination of corrupt party machines to national Jim Crow laws. We will decide on the nature of a deal in Atlanta, where Southern Democrat Carter Glass will meet with James F. Byrnes, Henry Ford, and a variety of NDWL leaders. These negotiations are sure to make the Republicans anxious, and they already seem to be planning their next move..."

ustates.31641.t: "What’s in a name?"
ustates.31641.d.NPP: "Following the NPP’s near-victory in the last round of elections, a growing faction within the Progressive Farmer-Labor Party has called for yet another change to the party’s name. Citing the presumed radicalism many potential voters associated with the name \"Progressive \",they call for adopting a name which will give the party establishment credentials and assuage the fears of potential voters. At the moment, the suggestion with the most backing is that of changing the name to the \"Radical Republican Party\". \n\nThe Radical Republicans were a faction of the GOP who called for the immediate and uncompromising eradication of slavery and its products during the Civil War and Reconstruction. President Ulysses S. Grant was their foremost member and is remembered for his civil service reform, progressive racial policy, and early environmentalism. For these reasons, and with the possibility of delivering a pointed message to the NPP and its Southern supporters, the idea of adopting a name associated both with champions of early progressivism and the party of Lincoln in its youngest days has grown increasingly popular. \n\nHowever, there are just as many who favor sticking by the present name, and it looks like either camp has a good chance of eliciting their preferred response to the proposal."
ustates.31641.a: "The name stays."
ustates.31641.b: "The name is changed."

ustates.3165.t: "Bringing Congress to Heel"
ustates.3165.d: "Today, Admiral King has announced the introduction of new limits on Congressional authority, largely stemming from his distrust for the institution as well as their willfull incompetence in helping him govern the country so far. In fact, far from helping him, they have done nothing but hamper him, denying funds for the navy and generally being a thorn in King's side. It was long past time that we dealt with these corrupt 'lawmakers' who have stayed past their welcome. After all, the preponderance of people whose real interest is in their own welfare as individuals, something inherent to democraies, as well as the belief of the common congressman that he knows it all, greatly inhibits our war effort. This ignorance, greed, and arrogance cannot be allowed to continue any further, and as such, it is time to decide our next move. Will we order the arrest of all of Congress, silence the troublemakers, or try to make legal justifications for our actions?"
ustates.3165.a: "Throw them all in prison!"
ustates.3165.b: "Silence the worst ones!"
ustates.3165.c: "We must get the people on our side..."

ustates.3166.t: "Protection for Payment"
ustates.3166.d: "One innovative plan that Ernest King has put forth, although his critics argue it is merely a repurposing of older strategies, has to do with naval security. With the advent of the American Civil War and prepartions for a global conflict on both sides of the Atlantic, it is more important than ever that shipping lines be kept as safe as possible to guarantee the continuation of trade. Such protection, of course, cannot come without real strength in the sea, and this is strength that King is more than willing to offer to nations on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, for a price. Some of our advisors are crying that this is no better than piracy, but King insists that we are merely making use of our resources to win the war. We could move forward with this plan and risk angering our neighbors, or we could reconsider. What shall we do?"
ustates.3166.a: "Begin patrolling and see how our neighbors react!"
ustates.3166.b: "This is too risky..."

ustates.3167.t: "A Curious Demand from America"
ustates.3167.d: "Today, we received a strange offer from the United States government. Under the leadership of Admiral Ernest King, their men has taken to the sea in alarming numbers, ostensibly to 'patrol the coastline'. Despite these claims, their ships often end up in the other ends of the Atlantic Ocean, and now they are demanding that we pay them in resources or other means in exchange for what they call 'protection'. By protection, it seems that they are talking about themselves, and the barely concealed fact that these sailors are raiding the Ocean is one that that will go unchallenged so long as they choose to target weaker nations. However, perhaps we could stand up to this arrogant nation. Doing so would incur a cost, but perhaps it would be worthwhile to save face..."
ustates.3167.a: "We have no choice..."
ustates.3167.b: "Stand up to these pirates!"

ustates.3168.t: "An Insulting Demand from America"
ustates.3168.d: "As a country in the midst of a civil war, few would expect would the United States to threaten more powerful nations, and yet that is exactly what it has decided to do. Diplomats have contacted us to reassure us that if we merely pay them their due, they will leave us alone, as if they own the sea! This situation is intolerable, but they are certainly strong enough to be a thorn in our side if they want to be. Should we cooperate, or tell them off?"
ustates.3168.a: "Cooperate, for now..."
ustates.3168.b: "How dare they!"

ustates.3169.t: "A Blank Check for King?"
ustates.3169.d: "In a bid to secure ever greater resources for the war effort, Ernest King has turned inwards towards Congress in an attempt to secure a blank check. Such a 'blank check' would give King permission to do whatever is necessary to extract the resources he argues are absolutely essential, though this largely concerns the construction of factories and dockyards. Given the tough position of the United States in the Civil War, it is less a question of whether Congress will accept and more a question of which proposal would be more likely to pass. Should we argue that dockyards are the most essential pieces of this war effort, or will we pursue a general industrial buildup?"
ustates.3169.a: "Focus on dockyards"
ustates.3169.b: "We must build our industry as a whole"

ustates.3170.t: "Demand the Canal?"
ustates.3170.d: "The construction of the Panama Canal was one of humanity's finest achievements, and the credit for it rightly went to the United States. Not only is it a fine achievement; it is also a necessity for efficient trade and naval travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, in recent years, we have lost control of this crucial point to foreigners, foreigners who took advantage of our weakness during the Civil War to exploit us abroad. Now though, it is time to confront those who stole the Panama Canal from us. It is time to get the canal we built back..."
ustates.3170.a: "Send the demand!"
ustates.3170.b: "On second thought..."

ustates.3171.t: "The United States Demands the Canal!"
ustates.3171.d: "Though we were able to take control of the Panama Canal while the United States faced a collapse internally, they have successfully reunited the country, and they want their canal back. They have threatened war if we decline, but is it worth it to give up such a worthy possession?"
ustates.3171.a: "Fine, fine!"
ustates.3171.b: "It is ours now!"

ustates.3172.t: "[FROM.GetName] Accepts our Demand!"
ustates.3172.d: "To the relief of all involved, [FROM.GetName] has ageed to give us back the Panama Canal, a region that is rightfully ours. Through the ownership of this canal, Ernest King feels much more secure in the position of the U.S. Navy, and perhaps we can even look elsewhere to expand our influence..."
ustates.3172.a: "Excellent" 

ustates.3173.t: "[FROM.GetName] Rejects our Demand!"
ustates.3173.d: "We have received word that [FROM.GetName] has rejected our offer, and now we must decide our next move. The refusal is clearly an insult to us, an indication of a lack of respect on their part for American might, and yet we promised an invasion if they refused. Should we make good on this promise?"
ustates.3173.a: "Yes, take it by force!"
ustates.3173.b: "Our opportunity will come..."

ustates.3174.t: "The United States Demands Atlantic Ports"
ustates.3174.d: "In what already seems like a setback to our plans, the United States has decided to demand control of the entirety of the Caribbean. Though this is an extremely bold offer, we are not in a position to cause trouble with the United States. Should we reject their offer outright, and call any bluff they may make, or give in to their demands?"
ustates.3174.a: "We have no choice..."
ustates.3174.b: "Absolutely not!"

ustates.3175.t: "The United States Demands Bermuda and the Bahamas"
ustates.3175.d: "In what already seems like a setback to our plans, the United States has decided to demand control of the Bermuda and Bahamas Islands. Though this is an extremely bold offer, we are not in a position to cause trouble with the United States. Should we reject their offer outright, and call any bluff they may make, or give in to their demands?"
ustates.3175.a: "We have no choice..."
ustates.3175.b: "Absolutely not!"

ustates.3176.t: "The United States Demands Naval Access"
ustates.3176.d: "In a bizarre move, the United States has requested access to our ports today, for purposes of refueling and naval actions should they occur, or so they say. This is somewhat untrustworthy, but we have also heard word that they held back in their demands, believing this is the best offer they could make that we could accept. Should we embolden them to take further action against us, or accept this offer while they are asking nicely?"
ustates.3176.a: "Yes, accept!"
ustates.3176.b: "No, they are too weak to hurt us..."

ustates.3177.t: "[FROM.GetName] Accepts!"
ustates.3177.d: "Today, our reasonable offer has been accepted by [ENT.GetName], marking a new day for the American security apparatus as well as our navy. The acquisition of these islands will put us on the track to spreading our influence around the world."
ustates.3177.a: "King wins again!"

ustates.3178.t: "[FROM.GetName] Denies Us!"
ustates.3178.d: "Though we made what was, by all accounts, a reasonable offer, the arrogant diplomats in [ENT.GetName] have decided to turn our offer down. There is little we can do over such a minor transgession, but this will certainly damage relations between our two nations!"
ustates.3178.a: "Horrible!"

ustates.3179.t: "[FROM.GetName] Accepts!"
ustates.3179.d: "Today, our reasonable offer has been accepted by [ENT.GetName], marking a new day for the American security apparatus as well as our navy. The acquisition of these islands will put us on the track to spreading our influence around the world."
ustates.3179.a: "King wins again!"

ustates.3180.t: "[FROM.GetName] Denies Us!"
ustates.3180.d: "Though we made what was, by all accounts, a reasonable offer, the arrogant diplomats in [ENT.GetName] have decided to turn our offer down. There is little we can do over such a minor transgession, but this will certainly damage relations between our two nations!"
ustates.3180.a: "Horrible!"

ustates.3181.t: "Bid for Atlantic Influence"
ustates.3181.d: "It is not secret that the Atlantic Ocean is our greatest defnese and our greatest vulnerability. Access to the ocean keeps our connections to the rest of the world alive, and control over these waters is paramount to our survival. However, many major powers are vying for control in the region, and we would do well to try and gain the upper hand. To do so, we could demand possession over British and French ports in the Caribbean, an offer these nations will almost certainly reject, but one that they may not be able to afford to reject. On the other hand, we could ask for better port access in [ENT.GetName]. What shall we do?"
ustates.3181.a: "Demand the Caribbean Ports!"
ustates.3181.b: "Only demand Bermuda and the Bahamas!"
ustates.3181.c: "Port Access is the least risky offer..."

ustates.3182.t: "Demand Guam?"
ustates.3182.d: "At the onset of the recent Civil War, the backstabbers in the East decided to steal Guam from right under our noses. Now, it is time to take it back. Guam may be small in the wider Pacific, but it was a valuable place of influence for us in the region. With Guam under our control, we were one step closer to projecting our influence over the entire Pacific Ocean, influence we have lost today. To regain our influence, we must demand our rightful territory...but will Japan agree?"
ustates.3182.a: "Yes! Make the demand!"
ustates.3182.b: "It isn't worth it." 

ustates.3183.t: "The Americans Demand Guam!"
ustates.3183.d: "Though we believed our seizure of Guam would go unnoticed or at least proceed with impunity, Admiral Ernest King, now in charge of the United States, has vowed to take it back, through diplomacy or other means. We could attempt to call his bluff, assuming it is one, but is the island worth the trouble?"
ustates.3183.a: "No, give it up!"
ustates.3183.b: "Yes, the island is rightfully ours!"

ustates.3184.t: "The Japanese Deny our Request!"
ustates.3184.d: "Those traitors in the East have denied our request for our rightful territory! Now we must decide what how we will respond to their arrogance. We could seize the islands before the Japanese know what hits them, but this would surely cause a diplomatic incident and perhaps a war. Although King has resisted the idea of extended negotiations for Guam, perhaps it would be best to just let it go and focus on matters closer at home. What should we do?"
ustates.3184.a: "Seize Guam!"
ustates.3184.b: "Let it go...for now"

ustates.3185.t: "Pacific Reconciliation"
ustates.3185.d: "The Pacific States of America stands in stark contrast to our other rivals, having a more democratic character and perhaps being more open to diplomacy with us. In an attempt to save precious American lives, our administration has decided to reach out to the Pacifician government in order to strike a peace accord, bringing about a complete cessation of current hostilities with a thorough peace deal. Though this may be a long shot, a total peace agreement could save countless American lives, both military and civilian. In order to woo these factionalists to our side, two main plans have been drafted. One such plan calls for the esteemed George Marshall, close ally and confident to many of America’s remaining hierarchs, to aid in our reconciliatory efforts as we approach the Pacifican government, using his clout and connections to foster more agreeable terms and dialect between both parties. Alternatively, we could do away with the risk of Marshall’s siren song potentially not working, and instead directly offer the Pacifician Head of State, President [CAL.GetLeader] the highest position in the White House. Though seemingly drastic and decried by many of our more conservative or stubborn cabinet members, offering this large an olive branch is all but guaranteed to help us finalize this sorely-needed peace deal. How shall we proceed?"
ustates.3185.a: "Unity and peace are our most pressing needs! Offer them the White House after the war!"
ustates.3185.b: "George Marshall shall help us mend the divide between the American people."
ustates.3185.c: "Pursue better relations only, they are too extreme to lead us..."

ustates.3186.t: "A Meeting on the Future of America"
ustates.3186.d: "With the American Civil War closer to a resolution every day, and with the tyrannical snake that was Douglas MacArthur now deposed, the United States stands on the precipice of its new future, with its path ahead shrouded in uncertainty. To better ascertain a unified direction to take this ailing nation on its road to recovery, acting Head of State William Leahy has decided to meet with the champions of the Federalist struggle against the supposed ‘American Caesar’: generals Dwight Eisenhower and Omar Bradley. With their support in the deposition of MacArthur, these two wardogs sit atop the hierarchy of the western United States, and as such, cooperation with them is vital if Leahy’s goals to restore democracy are to be met. Though Leahy may not see eye to eye with these wise men on every issue and dilemma America faces, they can all agree on the basic need of American democracy and personal liberties; ideas that have formed the bedrock of this Union since its inception. Though none will know explicitly what these three titans of the American government discussed in their smoke-filled offices and lounges, the people of these United States can breathe easy that work is being done to hammer out a path for America’s new future."
ustates.3186.a: "These wise men shall lead America towards redemption."

ustates.3187.t: "Admiral Leahy Makes an Offer!"
ustates.3187.d: "Today, we have received a curious offer from the Federal Government in Washington D.C. It is a very different Washington than the one we knew only months ago. Any semblances of democratic government were wiped away when Douglas MacArthur took control over the country and became a tyrant in his own right. However, Admiral William D. Leahy, as well as a variety of disgruntled politicians and military officers, have couped MacArthur and now plan to restore democracy in any possible form. Surprisingly, their plan for this involves our own government, which they say could serve as the rightful successor to the old United States government. If we agree to a ceasefire, they say, they will agree to make [CAL.GetLeader] the new President of the United States, with the U.S. Navy having an increased, if temporary, role in the government as the saviors of democracy. This is certainly an explosive offer, and though this new regime is questionable at best, perhaps we can trust them. What should we do?"

Leahy, as well as a variety of disgruntled politicians and military officers, have couped MacArthur and now plan to restore democracy in any possible form. Surprisingly, their plan for this involves our own government, which they say could compete against candidates of their choosing in an election after the war. That is, if we agree to a ceasefire, they say, they will agree to make [CAL.GetLeader] a candidate, along with their own, with the winner becoming the U.S. President. This would take place with the U.S. Navy having an increased, if temporary, role in the government as the saviors of democracy. This is certainly an explosive offer, and though this new regime is questionable at best, George Marshall urges us that we can trust them. What should we do?"
ustates.3187.a: "We will not stain our cause working with autocrats!"
ustates.3187.b: "A deal for all Americans!"

ustates.3188.t: "The West Declines Our Offer!"
ustates.3188.d: "The Pacific States have considered our offer of the White House in exchange for a peace deal, but it seems they do not trust us enough to make a deal. Though our hopes for a peaceful democratic resolution are dashed, perhaps we can look forward to an end of the war with our side victorious..."

ustates.3189.t: "The West Accepts Our Offer!"
ustates.3189.d: "It is done! The Pacific States, after careful consideration of our peace offer, have decided to accept in full and have now entered into peace negotiations with our forces. We expect them to ask for the presidency once the war is over (as promised), as well as certain policy concessions that mostly involve taking the military out of the government. However, there is no doubt that Leahy's role in saving democracy will be honored for decades to come, and together, these forces will save the country!"

ustates.3190.t: "Last Men Standing"
ustates.3190.d: "The USA and PSA are the last major governments standing from the ACW participants as each side has stuck to their respective treaties. The question now remains what to do to unite America as both sides view themselves as the legitimate American Government. As promised, we should send a dipomat to Washington to make sure they will take our president into the White House. On the other hand, some in the Pacific States are urging that we first demand that Leahy and his troops stand down-we wouldn't want a repeat of the MacArthur coup."
ustates.3190.d.Marshall: "The USA and PSA are the last major governments standing from the ACW participants as each side has stuck to their respective treaties. The question now remains what to do to unite America as both sides view themselves as the legitimate American Government. As promised, we should send send a representatives to the East to begin an election. The referendum offer would require voting oversight boards to help prevent tampering and that the losing side would be given more autonomy compared to the pre-war period to run their region more in-line with their own beliefs. As most of Congress is a shell in the recently conquered areas, the referendum would use proportional representation to decide the number of appointees in these regions, allowing the victor a chance to enact their agenda. On the other hand, some in the Pacific States are urging that we first demand that Leahy and his troops stand down-we wouldn't want a repeat of the MacArthur coup."
ustates.3190.a: "Send the offer"
ustates.3190.b: "Federal troops must stand down"

ustates.3191.t: "The Trial of the Century"
ustates.3191.d: "All persons having business before the Honorable, the Supreme Court of the United States, are admonished to draw near and give their attention, for the Court is now sitting.’ These hallowed words echoed throughout the chambers as the most anticipated trial in modern American history was about to commence. Not since the trial of President Lincoln’s assianation conspirators or the debacle of the Sacco-Vanzetti trial has the nation so fervently clamored for a verdict of justice to be decreed. However, today the defendant is no mere assassin or political radical, but instead the highly divisive former-General Douglas MacArthur. Once one of the leading figures and greatest heroes of the American Armed forces, MacArthur now stands humbled before the bench, stripped of all regalia and rank, at the mercy of the American people and the will of their perceived justice. This fallen titan stands accused of treason in his coup over the democratically elected government of the United States of America. As he awaits his likely arduous trial to begin, the nation waits on bated breath for the new Trial of the Century to begin. The American people are massively divided on this issue, as if division is what the nation needs now, with effectively half the nation seeing Macarthur as a hero and savior of democracy and Americanism, while the other side views him as a power hungry villain hellbent on absolute control over these United States. What the outcome for this grand trial shall be is unknown for the time being, but one thing all can agree on is that it is sure to be one long and painful trial; a pain necessary for America to feel before it can truly heal."
ustates.3191.a: "God save the United States and this honorable Court."

ustates.3192.t: "Justice Delivered?"
ustates.3192.d: "After days of arduous debate and lengthy rhetoric, the hallowed and honored justices of the Supreme Court are finally ready to announce their verdict. Former general Douglas MacArthur has been tried, fairly and fully, by the highest court in the nation and now the American people standby, waiting for any shred of news on this historic verdict. From Miami to Seattle, from San Diego to Bangor, every inch of this nation is abuzz, and ever divided, over the trial and its possible outcomes. As the nation watches and waits, the Chief Justice prepared to finally decree its decision. Many important figures in the country, from former presidents to Admiral Leahy himself, have noted that they are watching the case -and the verdict- closely. Whatever their final decision may be, it is certain that this Union will be caught up in an uproar regardless as both fans and foes to the old general eagerly await the final say."
ustates.3192.a: "The Supreme Court finds Douglas MacArthur innocent of all charges!"
ustates.3192.b: "The Supreme Court has found Douglas MacArthur guilty: his sentence shall be life-imprisonment!"

ustates.3193.d: "The Pacific States have decided that since we were allies over the course of the war that the USA is, more-or-less, a friend of democracy and, putting their personal reservations about the military aside, have offered to give our [CAL.GetLeader] his rightful place in the White House.With only a few Supreme Court justices still remaining both alive and credible, this would effectively hand the Supreme Court to [CAL.GetLeader]. As some of our officers believe the banking and political elite of the West is simply using this as an opportunity to reassert dominance of the political system and snuff out the military, they call on us to refuse and finish the job now, demanding they bend the knee to the will of the people."
ustates.3193.d.Marshall: "The Pacific States have decided that since we were allies over the course of the war that the USA is, more-or-less, a friend of democracy and, putting their personal reservations about the military aside, have offered to hold a national referendum for control of the nation, in which the current leadership of either the PSA or USA would become the dominant partner in a national government. Likewise, with only a few Supreme Court justices still remaining both alive and credible, this would effectively hand the Supreme Court to the victor, and allow for appointees to occupied areas to be decided via an informal proportional representation depending on the results of the referendum. As some of our officers believe the banking and political elite of the West is simply using this as an opportunity to reassert dominance of the political system and snuff out the military, they call on us to refuse and finish the job now, demanding they bend the knee to the will of the people."

ustates.3194.t: "PSA Demands we stand down!"
ustates.3194.d: "The Pacific States have demanded we stand down, claiming that we are partially responsible for the Civil War and that our government was provisional. They claim they would support amnesty for all military men if we surrender but this would obviously mean the political domination of the West and perhaps danger for the navy, and we very obviously can not accept. Feeling betrayed, the most militant of the Federalists call on us to attack."
ustates.3194.a: "Traitors!"

ustates.3195.t: "Leahy Accepts"

ustates.3196.t: "The Transition of Power"
ustates.3196.d: "Today, millions of Americans felt pride in their hearts as the peacefully elected president from the West entered the White House. Admiral William D. Leahy, who had led the country in practice during the war, was seen meeting with [CAL.GetLeader] for several hours before departing the White House for his home in Hampton, Iowa. Though it will be some time before the new administration is stable, it seems that democracy is finally returning to the United States. We will never forget what Admiral Leahy and the U.S. Navy did to save our country!"
ustates.3196.a: "God Bless America!"

ustates.3197.t: "Voting Begins"
ustates.3197.d: "Voting for the national ballot has begun with all parties involved using their campaigning skills and machines to full effect as they either attempt to bill themselves as a restoration to stability, liberalism and justice or claiming to chart a new American course that will ensure another Civil War and the injustices that preceded it will never occur again."
ustates.3197.a: "We'd better win"

ustates.3198.t: "Results are in!"
ustates.3198.d: "The results of the referendum that will decide the leaders of the federal government are finally in, with the respective governments laying all their legitimacy on accepting the results. The victor is:"

ustates.3199.t: "Congress Makes its Decision"
ustates.3199.d: "With the frames of our restored democracy being laid firmly in place as the foundations of our reforged state solidify, Congress has begun to deliberate on how Admiral Leahy’s successor will be chosen. For weeks, congressmen and cabinet members have bickered and squabbled over what would be the best way for this transition of power to occur, but finally Congress is ready to take the final vote. The two main sides of this debate have boiled down to either allowing Congress to make the decision, or leaving it up to the American people to decide. Whichever route Congress decides to go with, they must be certain it is the correct one, for their decision shall form the bedrock of this newly recreated American democracy for decades to come."

The National Guard are on the scene in [attack_state.GetName], and claim they are closer to catching the ringleaders behind these groups than they were before."
ustates.400.a: "We shall crush these terrorists."

ustates.404.t: "Longist Bombing"
ustates.404.d: "Supporters of Huey Long and his ideals have targeted factories, railways, and troop installations throughout [attack_state.GetName], causing a great deal of damage and the loss of many lives. The National Guard are on the scene in [attack_state.GetName], and claim they are closer to catching the ringleaders behind these groups than they were before."

### New Pre-ACW Events ###
ustates.500.t: "Garner-Wagner Bill Re-Introduced"
ustates.500.d: "With assurances made by President Hoover that, unlike in 1932, this time he will not veto the bill, Democratic Senator Robert Wagner and Speaker of the House John Nance Garner have re-introduced their unemployment relief legislation package. Many in Congress feel that the package does not go nearly far enough, while others wonder how America - in the midst of a massive economic crisis - will possibly ever pay for it. The presence of Senators from the AFP and the SPA also complicates things immensely. Even with Hoover's pledge, it's unknown if Garner-Wagner has a real chance of passing."
ustates.500.a: "We shall see"

ustates.501.t: "Long and Haywood Demand Changes"
ustates.501.d: "As expected, the early challenges to the Garner-Wagner Bill have come from the AFP and the SPA. Huey Long and his AFP Senators have demanded a vast increase in the social security provisions the bill provides, provisions most other Senators say America could never afford. Bill Haywood and the SPA, meanwhile, say the bill doesn't do enough to protect the average worker, particularly from exploitation by struggling corporations. Both parties have attracted a lot of media attention, adding to the general sense of disorder and tension in Congress."
ustates.501.a: "Interesting"

ustates.502.t: "Senators Break Ranks"
ustates.502.d: "After weeks of negotiations, a number of establishment Senators have broken ranks over the coming vote on the Garner-Wagner Bill - most notably Robert Wagner, one of the bill's proposers, who says he will not vote for the bill unless protections for federal unemployment insurance are re-added. Many other Democrat and Republican Senators are concerned about the influence of the AFP and the SPA, and claim they will not vote for the bill if *any* concessions are made to either group... though others say that not courting either the AFP or SPA will make passage difficult if not impossible. President Hoover will need to intervene in order to save the bill."
ustates.502.a: "Pledge support to Wagner and the establishment Senators"
ustates.502.b: "Force the establishment to compromise with the AFP"
ustates.502.c: "Force the establishment to compromise with the SPA"

ustates.503.t: "Long and Haywood Furious"
ustates.503.d: "Both Huey Long's AFP and Bill Haywood's SPA have reacted with fury at President Hoover's endorsement of establishment Senators. They have vowed to sink the Garner-Wagner Bill, claiming that the public is being deceived by a 'corrupt government which refuses to recognize the reality of America'. While the parties have both gained a considerable boost in support from their base, Democratic and Republican fortunes have improved somewhat, and there is a feeling that both have a better chance going into the next election... provided the bill actually passes."
ustates.503.a: "Let's hope it does!"

ustates.504.t: "Compromise with the AFP"
ustates.504.d: "Recent days have resulted in a compromise between many establishment Senators and the America First Party, with numerous extra provisions included for farm relief and unemployment protection - though nowhere near as far as the AFP originally demanded. Even so, Huey Long has declared this as a victory and is riding high in recent polls. Both Bill Haywood's SPA and a large number of Republican Senators have declared this a betrayal of the American public, however, and have vowed to sink the Garner-Wagner bill when the vote comes."
ustates.504.a: "We've done what we can..."

ustates.505.t: "Compromise with the SPA"
ustates.505.d: "Recent days have resulted in a compromise between many establishment Senators and the Socialist Party of America, with numerous extra provisions included for worker protections and unemployment relief - though nowhere near as far as the SPA originally demanded. Even so, Bill Haywood has declared this as a victory and is riding high in recent polls. Both Huey Long's AFP and a large number of Democratic Senators have declared this a betrayal of the American public, however, and have vowed to sink the Garner-Wagner bill when the vote comes."
ustates.505.a: "We've done what we can..."

ustates.507.t: "The Garner-Wagner Bill Passes!"
ustates.507.d: "Though the vote was incredibly close, the Garner-Wagner bill has passed Congress. People throughout the United States are celebrating this welcome relief to the country's disastrous economic situation, though many within the government are wondering: how will the bill now be paid for?"
ustates.507.a: "A victory for us all!"

ustates.508.t: "The Garner-Wagner Bill Fails!"
ustates.508.d: "After an incredibly close vote in Congress, the Garner-Wagner bill failed to pass. While several groups are declaring personal victory, protests have broken out in various parts of the country. There will be no relief for the American worker, and many have declared the government to be corrupt and dysfunctional. There will be considerable time for blame, but for the moment the Hoover government's concerns must turn to the growing violence throughout American cities - violence which is expected to only worsen in the months leading up to the election."
ustates.508.a: "All that for nothing..."

ustates.509.t: "War Plan White"
ustates.509.d: "The time has come to dust off one of the American military's colour-coded war plans, this one meant for dealing with domestic disturbances and insurgencies. It cannot come a moment too soon, as violence is escalating in areas where the ODP and the SPA have been contending with local authorities for dominance. Minnesota and North Carolina are the two states where the violence is at its height, and - at the moment - we can only focus our efforts in one place."
ustates.509.a: "Focus on the SPA in Minnesota"
ustates.509.b: "Focus on the ODP in North Carolina"

ustates.510.t: "Bringing out the National Guard"
ustates.510.d: "The National Guard has been deployed for over six months now, fighting to maintain security in a number of American cities, but there is a growing fear that commanders within the Guard are not entirely loyal to the Republic, that many harbor sympathies for the AFP and the SPA. More focus needs to be put on strengthening the units we know are loyal. We also need to decide where to focus their deployment, for the time being."
ustates.510.a: "Focus on restoring order in Minnesota"
ustates.510.b: "Focus on restoring order in Iowa"
ustates.510.c: "Focus on restoring order in Tennessee"

ustates.511.t: "General MacArthur's Plan"
ustates.511.d: "There is growing concern that America is descending into a possible civil war, and that - despite all our efforts to maintain security - supporters of the AFP and the SPA simply have too much influence in some parts of the country. General Douglas MacArthur has unveiled a plan to infiltrate key areas in either New York City or southern Texas. Both are of high importance, New York for its industry and Texas for its oil, and both are at high risk to takeover. MacArthur says that these efforts might still come to naught if the AFP and SPA's power become too great, but he believes it will greatly increase the government's chances of maintaining control should it come to an armed conflict."
ustates.511.a: "New York City is of vital importance"
ustates.511.b: "We absolutely need that Texan oil"

ustates.512.t: "The Hawking Plan"
ustates.512.d: "Junior Democratic Senator Thomas Hawking has introduced a bill which will see the relief efforts largely funded by taxing American corporations - in exchange for hefty tax considerations down the line, once the economy has recovered. This has caused considerably controversy in some corners, especially among ODP and SPA supporters. Others say it would be far too easy for the next government to reverse the decision, leaving the corporations holding the bag and even worse off than they were before. Regardless, there is enough support to see the bill passed - and, as an added bonus, the agency to coordinate the efforts could be placed in either Minneapolils or in Charlotte, with the added bonus of new employment weakening what are ODP and SPA strongholds."
ustates.512.a: "Base the agency in Minneapolis"
ustates.512.b: "Base the agency in Charlotte"

ustates.513.t: "The New Industrial Act"
ustates.513.d: "As an offshoot of the Hawking Plan, relief efforts will see new industrial growth in several vital areas - primarily in the military sector. Several of these new companies are planned for Denver, Colorado. At least one other area can be promoted, and the cabinet believes that putting them in depressed areas which are currently strongholds of the AFP or SPA may see their influence in those areas drastically weakened."
ustates.513.a: "Promote the industry in Minnesota"
ustates.513.b: "Promote the industry in Iowa"
ustates.513.c: "Promote the industry in Tennessee"

ustates.514.t: "The Shipyard Funding Scheme"
ustates.514.d: "The Hawking Plan has led to two major shipbuilding companies vying for a federal contract, one in New York City and the other in Corpus Christi. Both would mean a large number of jobs for the area, and would be a boon for our control over the region. The problem is that word of the contract has gotten out, and whichever city we *don't* choose will likely be enraged, giving strength to the AFP or the SPA in the region."
ustates.514.a: "Give the contract to New York City"
ustates.514.b: "Give the contract to Corpus Christi"

ustates.515.t: "America Demands War Debts"
ustates.515.d: "It came as a surprise to the Canadian government, but the ambassador from [USA.GetNameDef] has demanded that the Canadian government immediately begin repaying the war debts incurred by the British Empire during the Weltkrieg. While the Americans are gripped in an economic crisis, one Canada has, to an extent, avoided, they must know the Canadians can never repay the debt... not all at once, at least. Though the old United Kingdom was on its way to repayment, there was a tacit agreement after the British Revolution that the debts wouldn't continue to be repaid until the Home Islands were recaptured. For the Americans to demand it now, they must either be desperate or must be catering to the more warlike and isolationist elements in their government."
ustates.515.a: "Whatever the reason, we cannot do as they demand"

ustates.516.t: "Canada Refuses"
ustates.516.d: "The Canadian government has responded to the demand with a flat refusal. The debt, they say, was never meant to be repaid until the Home Islands were retaken - as most was incurred by the United Kingdom, a government which is now in exile. Even so, their refusal has done its job and fired up the isolationist elements of the American government. President Hoover's government has the support it needs, at the cost of relations with the Canadians."
ustates.516.a: "So be it"

ustates.517.t: "Compromise with America?"
ustates.517.d: "There has been a break in the chilly relations with the American government since their demand for debt repayment. They have approached us with an offer: economic assistance now, and an agreement to increase trade with the Entente, in exchange for the rest of the debt being delayed until the Home Isles are retaken... which was, aides point out, the original deal to begin with. It might be a way to restore goodwill with our southern neighbors, and even help them, though some are suggesting that there's no point in shoveling our limited funds into a bottomless pit. America is lost, they say, and we should look to our own first."
ustates.517.a: "We agree to the compromise"
ustates.517.b: "They are on their own"

ustates.518.t: "Canada Agrees to Compromise"
ustates.518.d: "The Canadian government has reluctantly agreed to the compromise, giving us what repayment they can now and accepting the deferment until the Home Isles have been retaken. In exchange, a trade agreement has been put in place with the Entente, something that's likely beneficial for us all. The main downside is that the agreement has been viewed as treachery by the AFP and the SPA, both of which claim our corrupt government has betrayed the very people they fired up only moments before."
ustates.518.a: "We'll take what we can get"

ustates.519.t: "Canada Refuses the Compromise"
ustates.519.d: "The Canadian government has refused our offer of compromise, leading to economic sanctions applied by both sides. The chance of this escalating to war is slight, but the damage is done. We'll have to be satisfied with the gains we've made, and the increased revenue from the tarriffs."
ustates.519.a: "It was worth a try"

ustates.520.t: "Long Bans the SPA from Congress"
ustates.520.d: "In a fiery speech, President Long declared that his intended reforms would have to wait - of far more pressing importance was the SPA and its insidious influence over America. The ongoing New Year's Strike is its doing, and it is America's number one public enemy. An executive order banned the SPA from Congress, and named the Minutemen as acting with emergency invested authority as executors of the president's will. While some in the halls of power are relieved to see action being taken against the SPA, many more are alarmed by President Long's use of executive power."
ustates.520.a: "So must it be"

ustates.521.t: "Haywood Bans America First from Congress"
ustates.521.d: "In a fiery speech, President Haywood declared that his intended reforms would have to wait - of far more pressing importance was the America First Party and its insidious influence over America. So long as the Minutemen milita run rampant, attacking strikers and innocent Americans alike, it will be America's number one public enemy. An executive order banned the AFP from Congress, and called on the SPA milita to act as emergency reinforcement to government forces. While some in the halls of power are relieved to see action being taken against the Minutemen, many more are alarmed by President Haywood's use of executive power."
ustates.521.a: "This has to be done, for the good of America"

ustates.522.t: "Executive Order 7061: Declare AFP Terrorist Organization"
ustates.522.d: "Citing national concerns due to the anarchistic nature of the Minutemen and the America First Party, Bill Haywood has passed an executive order that has declared them an illegal organization which seeks to overthrow the country, and as such all force shall be used to oppose them. Haywood has drawn a direct comparison between the Minutemen and the terrorist attacks that occurred on Preparedness Day in 1916, and Wall Street in 1920. The Minutemen are now subject to the Sedition Act of 1918, prosecuted as an anti-recruitment and vigilante group."
ustates.522.a: "Excellent!"

ustates.523.t: "Long Defies the Order"
ustates.523.d: "Huey Long publicly denounced Haywood's executive order as being unconstitutional and an act meant to suppress opposition to his rule and pave the way for syndialist reforms in America. Long has organized large rallies and protests with the Minutemen there to keep the protesters safe from aggression. These highly reported-on protests have seen union strikers beaten by Minutemen without interference from the police, which calls into question Haywood's ability to protect Americans."
ustates.523.a: "Rely on the police to keep control"

ustates.524.t: "Police Forces Defy Haywood"
ustates.524.d: "In an unexpected move, the police have refused to enforce the various executive orders. Within Atlanta, New Orleans, Houston, and other cities scattered throughout the American South, they have declared a Police Strike in solidarity with the AFP. While they worked to keep order, Police union leaders publicly declare that they would not follow the Laws of 'Haywood the Tyrant'. Thus Haywood has called in the US Army to enforce his laws."
ustates.524.a: "Send in the big boys"

ustates.525.t: "The Minutemen clash with the SPA"
ustates.525.d: "When government foces, bolstered by SPA milita, arrived in the American South to enforce the laws of the President, they were immediately set upon by Minutemen and supporters of the AFP. Shoot-outs quickly became commonplace, and the violence quickly spread throughout almost every major city in the Americna South. It has quickly noticed that the governmnet has no remaining authority there."
ustates.525.a: "Send in the biggest guys we've got"

ustates.526.t: "Time's Up!"
ustates.526.d.reed: "Haywood's support in D.C has finally bottomed out. General Douglas MacArthur has marched into Washington D.C today, to arrest Haywood and his cabinet at the White House, citing misgovernance and inaction that was putting the entire nation at risk of falling to radical elements. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the status quo, and were cheered instead of booed. Having been tipped off by SPA informants in MacArthur's command staff, Haywood was able to stay ahead of the general and has escaped to Chicago. MacArthur has chosen to inhabit the White House and coordinate an investigation into Haywood from the executive chair. Civil war is imminent."
ustates.526.d.long: "Long's support in D.C has finally bottomed out. General Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today to restore order, citing misgovernance and inaction on the part of the president which was putting the entire nation at risk of falling to radical elements. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the status quo, and were cheered instead of booed. Having been tipped off by AFP informants in MacArthur's command staff, Long was able to stay ahead of the traitorous general and has escaped to New Orleans. MacArthur has chosen to inhabit the White House and coordinate an investigation into Long from the executive chair. Civil war is imminent."
ustates.526.d.oldguard: "It appears [USA.GetLeader] has lost the confidence of his government. General Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today, having declared the president an 'ineffective leader whose inaction has endangered America'. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the country from extremist forces. The president's own cabinet has assured the public that this action is necessary, and have been working with MacArthur to install an emergency government from the White House - even as the majority of America looks on in shock. Civil war is imminent."
ustates.526.a: "Damn you, MacArthur! We would have gotten to it eventually!"

ustates.530.t: "An Envoy from the East"
ustates.530.d: "Ever since word arrived in [Root.GetNameDef] regarding General MacArthur willingly stepping down from power out east, we have wondered if we would hear from the new government. The ceasefire has held, after all - so do they desire peace? Our question has been answered with the arrival of an envoy from the Federal government. They wish to meet once again, this time to talk about a reunion between our democratic governments. Most here in the west are willing, but there are many who say that MacArthur must first pay for his crimes. He is as much a traitor as Long and Haywood, after all... if they are not willing to put him on trial as such, then how can we ever trust their word?"
ustates.530.a: "MacArthur did America a favor - we will rejoin, no questions asked"
ustates.530.b: "Yes, let them know we demand MacArthur be imprisoned first"
ustates.530.c: "We do not trust them, now or ever"

ustates.531.t: "The West Refuses to Meet"
ustates.531.d: "Sadly, the Pacific government has refused to meet with us. In the word of their letter: they simply don't believe we have regained true democracy."
ustates.531.a: "So be it"

ustates.532.t: "On One Condition..."
ustates.532.d: "The Pacific government seems amenable to rejoining [Root.GetNameDef]... on one condition: that MacArthur be imprisoned and put on trial as a traitor. According to [From.GetNameDef], he is as much responsible for the death and destruction of the civil war as Haywood and Long, and so long as he is not held to the same example as those men they cannot trust that our return to democracy is real. It could be done, and many in our cabinet say it must be, for the sake of peace, but truth be told MacArthur is considered by many Americans to be a hero. He won the civil war for us. To repay him this way seems almost unthinkable."
ustates.532.a: "For the good of America, let it be done"
ustates.532.b: "MacArthur is a goddamn hero - refuse"

ustates.533.t: "There Will be no Deal"
ustates.533.d: "The American government has responded to our demand with abject refusal. General Douglas MacArthur, they say, is a hero, one they see as having saved the country from syndicalism and radicalism, and one who gave up power once his duty was done. They would rather go to war than see his accomplishments denegrated."
ustates.533.a: "Then war it is"

ustates.534.t: "The Federal Government Agrees"
ustates.534.d: "While they are reluctant, for the sake of America the Federal government has agreed to our demand. Other matters will need to be addressed over time, but for the time being the General has been arrested and will await trial once we have rejoined the country."
ustates.534.a: "God Bless America!!"

ustates.535.t: "Our Brothers Have Returned"
ustates.535.d: "It seems the Pacific government has been awaiting our call, and they have answered it in the affirmative. Democracy has been restored across America, safe from syndicalism and radicals, and together we shall walk into the future."
ustates.535.a: "God Bless America!!"

ustates.536.t: "America Reunited!"
ustates.536.d.full: "With the restoration of democracy in the United States, the breakaway faction in the west evidently had no reason to continue the civil war. After several meetings between the two governments, the Pacfic States of America has agreed to a full peace with the east and has rejoined the federation. Crowds have filled the streets of cities from one end of America to the other, jubilant at the news that there will be no war and the Second American Civil War is now truly over."
ustates.536.d.arrest: "With the restoration of democracy in the United States, the breakaway faction in the west evidently had no reason to continue the civil war. After several meetings between the two governments, the only condition imposed by Pacific States was that General Douglas MacArthur be arrested and tried for treason. According to American officials, the West considered MacArthur just as much a traitor as Huey Long and Bill Haywood, and just as responsible for the death and destruction that ensued. Many in the United States consider MacArthur a hero, however, so when news was revealed of his arrest, angry demonstrations were just as prevalent as celebrations at the Pacific government's agreement to rejoin. It will likely take years for MacArthur's case to go to trial, and without a doubt will be a sensation, but for now the American Civil War is truly over."

ustates.538.a: "[USA_fourth_of_july_event_option]"

ustates.538.d.1936: "America had a brief period of calm today with a mostly peaceful Independence Day celebration. Commemorating the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 by the Second Continental Congress on the eve of the American Revolutionary war, the holiday is one of great importance to the American people. While many were worried that the rising tensions in America would result in yet another bout of violence in the long and brutal election season, most sighed a breath of relief today as the news reported little brawling during the annual celebration. While all the major candidates made sure to be seen and photographed among the large crowds and delivered speeches connecting their respective causes to the situation in 1776, most Americans took the time to take a break from the intense politics plaguing America. Instead they decided to just spend time with their families and friends amidst picnics and fireworks. It would seem for a brief moment, that America had finally received something it had lacked for a very long time... unity."
ustates.538.d.1937_USA_democratic: "Since the start of hostilities this year, many Americans held onto the false hope that the violence would settle down quickly and the politicians would find a solution without war. However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. President [Root.GetLeader] took to the air waves today in a widely-listened to broadcast in which he extolled American virtues and sacrifices while at war. He noted that July 4th was a day the disparate 13 colonies came together as one, and to found the great nation that Americans are now fighting for. To build a nation founded on democracy, prosperity, and unity. That despite their many differences, the founders were willing to put that aside and work peacefully to not only defend against British oppression, but also build a project to last generations. The radicals, he says, have sought to topple that peace and unity, to curtail democratic expression and replace voting with violence when they didn't get their way. So, one more time, Americans must come together and fend off those who would destroy the American way of life."
ustates.538.d.1937_USA_macarthur: "Since the start of hostilities this year, many Americans held onto the false hope that the violence would settle down quickly and the politicians would find a solution without war. However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. Today, America celebrates the anniversary of America's founding in the middle of civil war. Seeking to emulate General Washington's July 9th reading of the Declaration of Independence to the Continental Army gathered in New York City and rally the American people once again, President MacArthur has decided to deliver a speech before Federalist troops today. Noting that Washington had delivered his address even with British troops in the harbour, MacArthur reaffirmed that the United States military had always fought for American liberty and would continue to do so into the 20th century. Likening Congress's grant of emergency powers to him to Washington's commission as Commander-in-Chief, MacArthur concluded his speech by promising the American people to restore order to the Union."
ustates.538.d.1937_CSA: "Since the start of hostilities this year, many Americans held onto the false hope that the violence would settle down quickly and the politicians would find a solution without war. However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. While President Haywood had hoped to make his address near Independence Hall in Philadelphia, his staff dissuaded him from the plan. Instead, Haywood has elected to speak before assembled leaders at a local union chapter. Despite the relatively humble setting, the crowd watched with rapt attention. He noted that back in the day Americans had found themselves chafing under greed and neglect, and on this day they had formally organised for freedom from their chains. Noting that the first declaration had 27 points of grievances against the British, to roaring applause Haywood pulled out a list of 27 grievances the modern worker had and declared that the CSA would continue to fight on for a new America!"
ustates.538.d.1937_TEX: "Since the start of hostilities this year, many Americans held onto the false hope that the violence would settle down quickly and the politicians would find a solution without war. However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. President Huey Long made an address before a cheering crowd of supporters. While minutemen standing behind him scanned the rally for any would-be assassins, the crowd remained enthralled by the power of Long's voice. Long pointed out that in 1776, Americans were ruled by corrupt British oligarchs backed by the ruthless bayonets of the Redcoats. Despite the long odds however, American patriots rose up and drove out not only the British but their treacherous loyalists. Today he says, is no different. Americans must remain vigilant against the avaricious elite and their collaborators, and the modern minutemen stand ready to save America once again! Just as he finished, the fireworks show began behind him, much to the crowd's delight."
ustates.538.d.1937_PSA: "Since the start of hostilities this year, many Americans held onto the false hope that the violence would settle down quickly and the politicians would find a solution without war. However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. Today President [Root.GetLeader] has made an address before the provisional United States Congress. He said that in 1776, the Continental Congress declared war against tyranny and sought to preserve the rights of Americans, and soon became a beacon of liberty for many others. He emphasised that it was a democratically elected legislature, not a general or political strongman, who authorised the declaration of freedom. Today, he says, America finds itself once again at war against tyranny, fighting against forces willing to extinguish the flames of liberty. The President concluded by declaring that once America had vanquished the dictators in the East the restored constitutional government would once again live up to the Founder's dream of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness, and moreover from Sea to Shining Sea."
ustates.538.d.1937_NEE: "Since the start of hostilities this year, many Americans held onto the false hope that the violence would settle down quickly and the politicians would find a solution without war. However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. Some say New England was lucky to have avoided directly participating in the war. However, the atmosphere has remained tense and war looms on the horizon. While many detractors have pointed out the irony in celebrating the Fourth of July in the midst of a Canadian occupation, the provisional government in New England had sought to combat the perception of being a Canadian puppet by putting on a memorable Fourth of July celebration. Speaking before Bunker Hill monument, President [Root.GetLeader] delivered his address by recalling the sacrifices Americans made in order to protect the liberty and prosperity of the nation, bravely waiting until they could see the whites in their enemies eyes before firing their limited ammunition. He went on to stress that Americans and Canadians were working now as equal partners and brothers, and that someday America would be free once more."
ustates.538.d.1937_COR: "Since the start of hostilities this year, many Americans held onto the false hope that the violence would settle down quickly and the politicians would find a solution without war. However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. President Murray has neglected to make any official celebration of the 4th of July, only delivering a short speech promising to free the American people from the tyranny of foreign hordes; just as America's forefathers were freed from the oppression of the British. After Murray's short remarks, Vice-President Rankin announced his well wishes to the nation in its hour of need. While Murray's official celebration was nothing impressive, unofficially, many Klan leaders have seized the opportunity to hold large celebrations across the south, fit with southern barbecue, fishing, beers and cross-burnings. Henry Ford has also held large celebrations of America's independence day, hosting Charles Lindberg and letting factory workers off early (which has become rare occurrence); even proving them with a free refreshments. However, Ford's celebration did not come with any fireworks; as fireworks contain precious gunpowder needed for the eventual war effort."

However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. Today, America celebrates the anniversary of America's founding in the middle of civil war. Omar Bradley has gone to great lengths to provide the troops of the Western Command center with a suitable Fourth of July party, even going so far as to raid cattle farms near Denver to provide the soldiers with a hearty meal. This all in an effort to provide the troops with one last night of good old-fashioned American unity and celebration. As devastation looms on the other end of the Rockies, Bradley can only brace for the long war that is bound to follow. As the sun sets on July 4th, the brave men of the Western Command Center shift from celebration to preparing for the inevitable, as no amount of beer, fireworks or barbecue will stop this war now; and many doubt that the Western Command Center can hold out against the titans crashing down around us."

He stressed that, although their soldiers may not be there to celebrate with them, they are fighting for the most sacred cause - that of liberty. Through the years, America has never stopped fighting for its democracy. Not in the highs and lows of the Revolution, not in 1812 when Washington fell, not in the Civil War. And more importantly, he said, true patriots have always fought together. Now it's our turn.

Although the revolution had caused much damage and suffering, Americans continued to fight on. And through the ashes were able to build a new society not seen before on Earth. The President promised that although America is in the midst of a brutal civil war, the Second American revolution will once again build a new order out of the ashes, one that will spell both liberty and mutual prosperity for all. The America the founders envisioned, and the final realisation of the ideals set forth by the Declaration."

Although the makeup did little to hide the bags under the President's eyes, [Root.GetLeader] spoke with as much fervour as always. The war is a time of troubles and strife no doubt, but it was that way back in the Revolution. The Patriots have always come out on top in the end, and this time America's sons of liberty are fighting to rid America once and for all of those who would harm her - the unruly Socialists in Chicago, the decadent bankers on Wall Street, the imperious military men in Washington. The Fourth of July, the President noted, is a day patriots have always come together as one. And with God's help, he went on, when the war is over they will do so once again."

Speaking before the assembled congressmen, and knowing that his speech was being recorded for all to hear, the President noted that despite all chaos and turmoil, the democratic government in America continued to function. Proof, he said, that America does not need dictatorships and tyrants in order to continue functioning. And although things could be pretty bleak, there was no shortage of people willing to continue fighting for liberty then, in 1776, and there is no shortage of people willing to fight for liberty now.

An uneasy ceasefire has been established between East and West in America as both sides work to stabilise their respective territories and consolidate power. Much of America on both sides remains ravaged by the bombings and fighting, and casualties have been high. Americans pray for a peaceful outcome to the standoff, hoping for a solution that sees their side come out on top while avoiding further conflict. Still, on July Fourth both sides of the border have seen their people turn out for celebration, initially muted before celebrating a Fourth of July finally free of war. The sorrow and horror of the years before, between Depression and War, has receded for the day as people stop worrying for just a little bit. Indeed, some have speculated that maybe this peace could last with just a little bit of negotiations.

Tensions remain in the air, however as the situation continues into July both sides of the border now celebrate the Fourth of July, a Fourth of July free of further civil war and killings (for now). While some of the more hawkish complain that, generations later Boston remains under British occupation and have tried to draw on the holiday to agitate for a violent liberation of New England, the vast majority of Americans on both sides have taken the holiday as a chance for a peaceful respite from all the troubles the last few years have caused.

However, there is one part of the country where there have been no celebrations outside of military bases. Like Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold in 1775, the Americans have recently invaded their northern neighbour. Unlike their Revolutionary War predecessors however, they have successfully annexed Canada, an ambition many thought Americans had long dropped. Despite attempts to encourage the locals to participate in the festivities and the insistence of [Root.GetLeader] that America has liberated their Canada brethren from British rule at last, responses have been muted in the North. Mayors of major Canadian cities have made reticent official statements acknowledging the holiday, however it is clear that it will be many years before the Fourth of July is celebrated in Canada, if ever.

Instead he said that he would accept imprisonment if it would bring the nation back together again without further bloodshed. He stated that he only did what he did in order to protect America, and was grateful for his many years in service as a \"fulfilment of his boyish hopes and dreams\".\n\nThough many in the audience clapped, critics have almost immediately lashed out, noting that MacArthur's coup helped trigger the civil war in the first place.

ustates.600.t: "Status of the US Army"
ustates.600.d: "The defence of the United States has always been an uphill battle. Stretched thin against the vast breadth of the North American continent, the United States Army has had little chance to distinguish itself throughout its 160 year history. It won the bare minimum of victories to maintain American independence during the Revolution and the War of 1812. It performed admirably against a corrupt regime in the Mexican-American War but half of those forces would provide the seed for the fledgeling Confederate Army during the ensuing Civil War. More recently the Army performed barely adequately to subdue the heavily outgunned Spanish and struggled to suppress the half-starved Filipino Insurrection more than 30 years ago. Prevented from joining in the Weltkrieg on either side, it has suffered in both doctrine and technology, with no tanks at all and a small Air Corps subsidiary to the ground forces. With the hobbled lion that was the British Empire on the northern frontier and a syndicalist stronghold poised in the south, the U.S. Army must be asked to defend the Republic from enemies within and without, and few agree that they are up to the task."
ustates.600.a: "They'll have to suffice"

ustates.601.t: "Status of the US Navy"
ustates.601.d: "The United States Navy, long the darling child of the American defense establishment has been a strong force in global maritime affairs for nearly fifty years. A rival even to the vaunted Kaiserliche Marine and Royal Navy at their height in the Weltkrieg, it has defended America's shores and sallied forth to spread stability and democracy for nigh on 160 years. From John Paul Jones' raid on the British mainland to the Battle of Manila Bay, the Navy has provided the security needed by the republic from those that would infringe upon our independence from beyond the seas. All is not well in the modern day, however. The navy's ships are old, her flagships Weltkrieg-era dreadnoughts even as Germany and the Syndicalists engage in a new naval arms race, and the tattered remnants of the Royal Navy lick their wounds. New carriers have been commissioned, but they are nowhere near ready to take on the imperial Japanese fleet. The Marine Corps fares better, hardened as they are by constant action in tropical locals, but they are small, only a few regiments strong, and are powerless to affect increasing tension at home from their far-flung island bases. The honour guard in Washington D.C. look increasingly powerless as violence in the nation's capital increases. Our White ships might dominate the waves but many question whether it will be enough to face the gathering storm on the horizon."

ustates.603.t: "Air Force Independence Debate"
ustates.603.d: "The Air Force has remained as a mostly tokenistic part of the Army, with barely any investment going towards it during the 1920s and 1930s. However, air development during these last decades have proven that a strong air force is a vital asset for an army who wishes to come out victorious from the battlefield. Unfortunately, the Army High Command in many aspects refuses to acknowledge this, and as a result, spark conflict with many Air Branch generals who wish to direct the development of their own branch. With the country's integrity at stake, the High Command has decided to negotiate with the Air Force Generals, and the result of the negotiations is pretty clear: The Air Branch will not stand for a continuation of the Status Quo, and demands that at best, their force is given significant autonomy from the Army and reorganize as the United States Army Air Force, and at worse for the United States Army Air Corps to be expanded and supported to suit the needs of the battlefield. With the High Command being undecided on the issue, the final decision has been sent to the War Department, where it has been forwarded to the Secretary of Defense to decide on the matter."

ustates.604.t: "Adna R. Chaffee Dies"
ustates.604.d: "After months of struggle in the hospital, Major General Adna R. Chaffee has unfortunately passed away due to cancer. Considered by many as the father of American Armored Corps, the mentor of many tank crews and officers and one of the main reformers of the US Army, his taken most of the High Command by surprise. Luckily, he had layed out his plans to High Command clearly, so while his death is a tragic turn of events, it won't hinder our army reforms."
ustates.604.a: "His Expertise will be missed Nonetheless"

ustates.605.t: "Tank Competition"
ustates.605.d: "While our tanks in the assembly line have proven useful, Chaffee considers that their role is too spread for them to be effective. Right now our tanks are too slow to be used to take advantage of breakthroughs, but not armoured enough to sustain anti-tank proyectiles, let alone tank-to-tank combat. Since achieving both is simply unachievable with the current state of our nation, we can however focus on one aspect so that our tanks may serve a specific role."

ustates.606.t: "Seizure of Civilian Trucks"
ustates.606.d: "After Chaffee announced his Motorization program for the Army, a proposal was sent to the Secretary of Defence by the War Department to decide on the requisition of civilian vehicles in order to supply our fast-growing army. With his approval, we have begun seizing vehicles from the civilian populace, although to our surprise, some proud patriots line up next to our storages to volunteer their vehicles for the incoming fight. While not all their vehicles have proven to be useful for us, we have managed to requisition a fair amount of trucks which can either be modified to transport troops with ease or which are sturdy enough to transport our troops at once."
ustates.606.a: "We thank you for your service"

ustates.607.t: "Production Prioritization"
ustates.607.d: "As the American industry hums along McNair's artillery designs, a new debacle has begun among members of the High Command. Front Line reports of complete squads being wiped out by enemy dive bombings have been a concern of the staff since the beggining of the American Civil War, but the quick development of armored elements in the enemy forces are overwhelming our army of mostly barely-equipped grunts. After asking for extra resources to the War Department, extra investments have been authorized for the Army, but they'd need to be adressed to a particular type of countermeasures against the enemy tactics, and so the High Command must choose wisely what it shall invest it in..."

ustates.607.b: "Anti Air Guns are more important"

ustates.608.t: "First Paradrop Exercise"
ustates.608.d: "While technically speaking, the first paradropping excercises were practiced in 1930 with biplanes dropping machine gun squads, today a major breakthrough has been achieved in the airborne department. After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training program started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from the Langley Air Field and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Benning. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was Pvt. William N. "Red" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft. After their touchdown, they quickly reached the rendezvous point and completed their excercise goals, making the experiment a success."
ustates.608.a: "Start Scheduling New Jumps"

ustates.609.t: "Formation of the First Paratrooper Divisions"
ustates.609.d: "With the success of our scheduled mass jumps and with the blessing of General John C.H. Lee, the recently reopened Fort Eustis had begun taking volunteers for paratrooper units. While originally the high training standards and relatively high mortal risk initially caused few volunteers to show up, the high command authorized a triplication of the paratrooper wage as opposed to the foot soldier wage. Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilize. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the High Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."
ustates.609.a: "'Death from Above'"

ustates.610.t: "Conservative Army Elements complain about the Creation of the USAAF"
ustates.610.d: "With the decision from the Secretary of Defence to form the US Army Air Force, which in consequence granted huge autonomy to the Air Force Officers, many officers have spoken out against the reform. One of the main points of contention is that, with the budget already pretty split between the Army and the Navy, the Army Air Force will now more than ever be a money sink that would be badly needed for the ground troops. Regardless of their heated complain letters to the war department, the decision has been made and reforms are ongoing, so there's no going back."
ustates.610.a: "They'll have to Learn to Respect each other"

ustates.611.t: "MacArthur Attacks the Navy"
ustates.611.d: "With more and more government founding being diverted to the navy, Chief of Staff MacArthur has taken up a severe accusation to the Secretary of Defence: He believes the recent investments on the navy are part of a plot that he had discovered in the early 1930s where the Navy would dominate the Army in the field and just turn the Army into a subordinate garrison force. While the Secretary has managed to calm the General down and reassure him that the army's role in the battlefield will always come first, word of the meeting has gone out and many Admirals, including MacArthur's bitter rival Admiral Hart, are already sending letters asking for MacArthur's resignation. While the relations between MacArthur and navy have been bad for years, this is yet another sad example of how the inter-service rivalry has done nothing but grow in the last few years."
ustates.611.a: "What's wrong with them? We won't win battles by bickering!"

ustates.612.t: "McNair releases Antimechanized Defence Combat Manual"
ustates.612.d: "After nearly a decade of studies and compiling the analysis of recent conflicts both at home and abroad, General Leslie McNair has finally published the book Antimechanized Defence, where he explores the recent development on mechanized tactics and how to counter them. The manual consists of seven chapters – the first titled “General” followed by six chapters describing employment of antitank units in various scenarios (during the advance, halts, the development of the battle, defensive maneuvers, retrograde movements, and offensive operations). The document highlights the specific capabilities of tanks that makes them a unique threat on a modern battlefield characterized by open warfare, like the tank's speed and mobility which, when combined with the lack of a stabilized front, increased the need to ensure protection of flanks and rear areas against armored attacks. While officer trainees will loathe having another manual to read in the pile, this one is quickly turning into a must after the recent engagements."
ustates.612.a: "Finally! A Book that will guide us to Victory!"

ustates.613.t: "Chaffee Organizes the Combat Commands"
ustates.613.d: "The concept Chaffee first envisaged during his development mechanized tactics in the early 1930s was one where combined arms mechanized units would possess no formal structure. In order to present his idea more coherently to high command, he has recently written the 'Armored Force Tentative Table of Organization' where the Combat Command, as he describes it, should be flexible organization that should not have dedicated battalions. Instead, tank, armored infantry, and armored field artillery battalions, as well as smaller units of tank destroyers, engineers, and mechanized cavalry have to be assigned as needed in order to accomplish any given mission. To achieve this, he wishes to split the armored division into the combat commands named "A" for the main force, "B" for flank defense, and "R" for reserve units. While his concept is clearly inspired in the German 'Kampfgruppe' concept, the High Command has received his idea with open arms and are starting to implement the new organization system across the board as well as distributing the new manual to the field officers."
ustates.613.a: "It seems that studying the Germans has paid off"

ustates.614.t: "Release of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet"
ustates.614.d: "One of the major lessons from the civil war was the need to enhance the speed and clarity of our communications on the front line while not making our movements and organization system obvious to the enemy. In order to create a consistent naming system, the Army and Navy had designated a comission from the Signal Corps to work on a new radio alphabet system for our men to use, and we finally have the results from their efforts. With the publishing and distribution of the 'Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet' manual, our new alphabet shall utilize the codenames Able, Baker, Charlie, Dog, Easy, Fox, George, How, Item, Jig, King, Love, Mike, Nan, Oboe, Peter, Queen, Roger, Sugar, Tare, Uncle, Victor, William, X-ray, Yoke and Zebra. While similar radio systems have been developed for the Canadians and the Germans, the fact we have finally taken the task of standarizing it means we're finally catching up with the lessons we missed in the Weltkrieg"
ustates.614.a: "This will give us an Edge in Communications"

ustates.615.t: "Adoption of the M1 helmet"
ustates.615.d: "Ever since the Weltkrieg proved that helmets were vital to protect the infantry from flying fragments of exploded ordnance, the American Army has utilized the British Mk I helmet designed by John L. Brodie, which gave it its current nickname. While adopted, the US never saw a need to mass produce it, and instead continued to buy the model from the British in the cheap during their depression in the early 1920s. While these helmets were effective at the time, our experience in the civil war has proven that even the Brodie is no longer suitable for modern combat and, as such, a research team was created under Major Harold G. Sydenham to look for alternatives. The research team concluded that by removing the Brodie's brim, by adding side pieces and earpiece, and by incorporating the suspension system into a separate inner liner, the new helmet could provide a protection the Brodie could never afford. The original test item was known as the TS3, and it received a favorable report from the Infantry Board in the recent weeks. With the approval of the War Department, it will soon enter mass production to supply our rapidly growing army."
ustates.615.a: "Glad we finally got rid of the Brodies"

ustates.616.t: "The Victory Book Campaign"
ustates.616.d: "As thousands of new recruits flood into training camps across the country, community librarians have recognized an opportunity to lend their support to our government. Individual libraries sponsored book drives to donate to their local military bases. In the last few months, members of the American Library Association met to discuss a plan for a coordinated nationwide drive to supply the troops with free books. The ALA presented their idea to the United Service Organizations and The Red Cross, who have received their idea enthusiastically and begun setting up more than four hundred recreational clubs on the outskirts of military camps. The Red Cross wanted books to send to military hospitals, remote camps with no libraries, their overseas clubs, and prisoners of war. The two organizations decided to split the project's funding, while the ALA provided technical know-how and both began campaigning for government approval. While our military is reluctant of accepting donated books, there is a real need for entertainment for our soldiers in the field and Army high command decided to give its approval to the project."
ustates.616.a: "Let's hope our soldiers enjoy it"

ustates.617.t: "Cancellation of the Victory Book Campaign"
ustates.617.d: "While the Victory Book Campaign has managed to pave the way for institutions like the Council on Books in Wartime and the War Book Panel, the Campaign itself is beginning to draw a lot of criticism from the Army. The Campaign was unfortunately not well suited for combat units, as the bulky hardcovers were found to be unsuitable for use in the field and many of the books donated were deemed unfitting by the revision committees. From 10.827.097 books gathered in the last year, an unacceptably high percentage of these were unsuitable, with VBC staffers having discarded 5,052,858 books. While the idea is still in the air, the Army has decided to order the VBC to come to a close, but has begun plans with the CBW to create a new plan to entertain our soldiers."
ustates.617.a: "Something Ends, Something Begins"

ustates.618.t: "Creation of the Armed Services Editions"
ustates.618.d: "With the collaboration of the graphic artist H. Stanley Thompson and the publisher and CWB executive Malcolm Johnson, Army Chief Librarian Raymond Trautman proposed his idea of 'Armed Services Editions': mass-produced paperbacks selected by a panel of literary experts from among classics, bestsellers, humor books and poetry. With the support of the Navy Chief Librarian Isabel DuBois, the project managed to reach the Army High Command. While the proposal was sound, a clause in Trautmant's proposal sparked controversy in the High Command Meeting. As he stated that all books should be, in all circumstances, acceptable to both services, and that works with 'Statements or attitudes offensive to our Allies, any religious or racial group, or not in accord 'with the spirit of American democracy'' should be discarded. Regardless of the controversy that it caused, the Army and Navy high command have agreed to give the project the green light, with both branches offering their own printing presses and the funding to expand printing further if necessary."
ustates.618.a: "Let's hope this time the Books Last"

ustates.619.t: "Creation of a Sniper Program?"
ustates.619.d: "With the harsh lessons in urban warfare we have been forced to learn, we've come to realize that our army is woefully unprepared to face a new danger of the battlefield: Enemy Snipers. While Snipers proved their usefulness during the Weltkrieg, the Army high command had never seen any reason to expand upon it as it was seen as a situational solution for the battlefields of Europe. However, fighting in the American mountains, cities and forests have proved not only that they were wrong, but we have paid the price dearly for it, as we lack the means to counter-act enemy sniper operations, let alone send off snipers of our own to eliminate High Value Targets. As such, a proposal has reached High Command to kickstart one similar to the Sniper training that Canadian put their snipers through in the weltkrieg."
ustates.619.a: "The Proposal Passes"
ustates.619.b: "The Proposal is Shut Down"

ustates.620.t: "Sniper Selection"
ustates.620.d: "With the first test group of snipers having left basic training, the question has been brought up. While the first test group was drawn from volunteers from all the US Army, there has been a significant performance difference between the Marine and Ranger volunteers compared to the regular army volunteers. As such, both branches are contesting for the funding of the War Department to continue the Sniper Program, and we can only pick one. Which branch shall we support?"
ustates.620.a: "Favour the Army's Rangers"
ustates.620.b: "Favour the Navy's Marines"

ustates.621.t: "Creation of the Office for Emergency Management"
ustates.621.d: "With the outbreak of the civil war, the President has dispatched the creation via executive order of an office that functioned to assist the President in clearing information on immediate defense measures. With it, the Office for Emergency Management has been born to maintain liaison with national defense agencies and to coordinate the national defense program, as well as keep both the Army and Navy in direct contact with the President. However, the mess of agencies, offices and commissions we have generated in the last few decades continues to grow, and many agree that our government should start looking into ways of reducing the amount of offices and increase the efficiency of existing ones."
ustates.621.a: "For now, this will do"

ustates.622.t: "Creation of the United States Office of War Information"
ustates.622.d: "Due to a lack of a centralized government agency to work as a distributor of wartime information, civilian newspapers present news as they discover and interpret it, with different outlets overalapping their stories with slight variations and the public hardly knowing what is true and what is propaganda. As such, and with permission of both the War Department and the President, the Office of War Information has been created to work as a connection between the battlefront and civilian communities. While many independent news outlets have expressed their concerns over a centralized agency becoming the sole distributor of wartime information, most experts agree that this is a necessary move."
ustates.622.a: "They have nothing to fear, we shall spread only the truth!"

ustates.623.t: "Changing the USAAC Roundel?"
ustates.623.d: "The issue has been brought up that our air planes share the same air force patch as our enemies. While radio communication has allowed us so far to distinguish between friend and foe, reports of friendly fire and unexpected enemy attacks abound, and the Air Force officers have come with a proposal to change our roundel from the star symbol within a blue circle with a red dot in the middle to a different roundel so our anti air units may better differentiate our planes from the enemy's. What should we do?"
ustates.623.a: "Let the enemy change it! This roundel is ours"
ustates.623.b: "Change it"

ustates.624.t: "Authorize Fire Bombings?"
ustates.624.d: "With the success of strategic bombing during the Weltkrieg, a proposal from the USAAF has reached the High Command. In it, it describes how to utilize a percentage of the budget to create a separate group of bombs with a special chemical mixture that can start huge fires upon landing, with the idea of utilizing these bombs on American soil against our enemies. While this could yield great effects hindering our enemy's industrial capabilities, the ethical implications of utilizing such inhumane weapons of destruction has made many members of the staff restless on the subject, as these bombs might easily end up hitting civilians unintentionally. Should we approve this despite of the dangers?"
ustates.624.a: "Yes, they are all traitors!"
ustates.624.b: "No, they are Americans too!"

ustates.625.t: "The War Department Relocates to the Main Navy and Munitions Buildings"
ustates.625.d: "With the Department of State leaving almost no room for the War Department to grow near the White House, the Secretary of War has authorized the War Department to move to a different location, specifically an ammunition warehouse provided by the navy. However, the warehouse is still too small the hold the ever growing War Department, with a new wing having been ordered to be constructed to acommodate newly employed staff, and we estimate we will need a larger structure to consolidate the 24.000 workers in offices scattered among 17 separate sites, as well as a possible additional 10.000 or more new workers that we are planning to include soon as our nation falls into conflict into conflict."

ustates.626.d: "Under the High Command's orders, General McNair has compiled a report of all the major flaws our army possesses at the moment that we will need to solve if we wish to prevail against our enemies in the civil war. The major summary sent to the War Department lists the following issues:\n\n1. Obviously deficient training of small units and in minor tactics.\n2. Faulty employment of the infantry division and of its combat teams.\n3. Failure fully to appreciate the purpose of motor vehicles and exploit their capabilities.\n4. Inadequate reconnaissance and lack of contact between adjacent units.\n5. Inadequate support of infantry by division artillery.\n6. Faulty signal communications.\n7. Too passive employment of antitank guns.\n8. Improper employment of horse cavalry.\n9. Neglect of ammunition supply and evacuation of wounded.\n10. Unreal situations due to faulty umpiring.\n\nIn the same manner, other issues have been brought up by other officers in which they include shortages of qualified staff officers and commanders to fill all the staff roles and deficiencies in individual training that would delay the effectiveness of unit training."
ustates.626.a: "We have to reform if we wish to prevail"

ustates.627.t: "Construction of 'The Pentagon'"
ustates.627.d: "With the shortcomings of the Main Navy and Munitions Buildings, the search for a more fitting permanent office space for the War Department has been ongoing for months already. First the military turned to the head of the Army’s Construction Division, Brig. Gen. Brehon Burke Somervell. He, in turn, tasked the chief of the design section, Lt. Col. Hugh J. Casey, to come up with a building that would fit a five-sided parcel of land that had been hastily purchased just below Arlington National Cemetery on the Virginia side of the Potomac River, which would house all the War Department's components. Originally the building was meant to be placed in a location known as the Arlington Farms, where the road shape resembles a Pentagon, which has forced the architect team to adapt the design to said geographic space. Many in the Department, however are questioning if positioning the building between the cementery, which by all means is considered hallowed ground for every American, and the stunning view of Washington D.C. is really appropiate, and two new locations have been proposed for the construction. Unfortunately, the requests for the materials have already been designed to accomodate a pentagonal shape, so even if we were to change the building location, the building will still be made in that shape, but we still need to decide where should the Pentagon be."

ustates.628.d: "While the construction of the Pentagon is still ongoing, the War Department has decided to move to the incomplete building, so as to not have to share space with the Navy staff anymore. Even though the building isn't even yet complete, a new expansion of the now lovingly called 'Pentagon' has already been authorized, and of the 5 wings, the 3 remaining ones to be built shall have bigger offices to accomodate the War Department's staff."

ustates.629.t: "Pentagon is Finished"
ustates.629.d: "With the final wing finally finished, the War Department has finally found its own home and the building now sports a reinforced concrete structure, using 680,000 tons of sand dredged from the Potomac River and Indiana limestone for the building's façade. It occupies 28.7 acres (116,000 m2), and includes an additional 5.1 acres (21,000 m2) as a central courtyard, with the hallways being so large that messengers are being issued with roller skates and bikes to speed up messaging between offices."

ustates.677.d: "As we continue to rebuild these lands that our fathers and sons have all fought and died for so valiantly to protect, a sense of internal security is once again washing over the American people. Though separatist holdouts and radicals still harass the outskirts and underbelly of our newly purified and vindicated society and despite much of our policy and new edicts still being adjusted to by our citizens, the gaze of our keen-eyed and opportunistic advisors has once again begun to drift towards new avenues for prosperity and profit. \n\nAcross the stormy Atlantic lies a land still cloaked in an air of mystery and rife with opportunity unlike any other on Earth: Africa. From the serene and arid Mediterranen Coast, across the blistering Sahara, and down through the lands of the Congo to the tip of the Cape of Good Hope, every mile of the ‘Dark Continent’ is a veritable treasure trove of untapped and underutilized potential. The key culprit of this underutilization has been the absent-minded and short-sighted European imperial powers, who have long squandered the amazing bounty they lay claim to. \n\nHowever, we are fortunate enough that two independent African nations not only lie in our reach, but have previous ties with the former American government that stood before our righteous victory: South Africa, and our former colony Liberia. Our administration, given its newly restored stability and confidence, has sought to send a ‘diplomatic and economic overture’ to these free-standing African nations to stand as the new foothold of American interests within Africa. As always though, the masterminds behind this plan within our cabinet can not agree on how to best go about the situation, with three main proposals standing as plausible options. We can either send a generous, and cut-throat, trade delegation to their capitals, opening the door for American business to operate within Liberian and South African markets. Alternatively, many within our administration seek to take these trade talks one step further and offer them a seat within our newly established military alliance, paving the way for American military dominance on the Dark Continent. Finally, the warhawks within our group seek to skip the pleasantries entirely and demand that these weak and exposed governments fully subserviate themselves to our whim, for despite the wounds of our recent civil war, these nations pale in comparison to the might of the American warmachine.

Men such as he are never comfortable in the presence of their betters... Whispers and rumors surround the Capitol, and MacArthur plans to speak before the Senate and present a message of confidence, strength, and renewal to the American people. The Secret Service urges the Commander-in-Chief to remain in the safety of the White House for the time being, until their investigation discerns the truth or falsity of these murderous rumors. Cowards die many times before their deaths. The valiant never taste death but once."

ustates.998.d: "In a shocking turn of events, Douglas MacArthur has been assassinated while addressing Congress today! As he stood before the crowd of congressmen, Harry S. Truman rushed forth and delivered a wounding shot to the dictator's shoulder. As MacArthur drew his own Colt pistol, more members of Congress rushed at him, including Sam Rayburn and Frederick Hale, who have vocally stood against the curtailing of American liberties under the stratocracy, and fatally shot him. Law enforcement was far too late to stop the attackers, but arrived in time to witness Robert A. Taft give an impromptu speech on the restoration of American democracy, ending it with the immortal phrase "sic semper tyrannis.” While those who perpetrated the act have been arrested, those who merely stood and watched as the American Caesar was killed are being questioned for their involvement. This horrifying event has shaken the country to its core, and many fear that the violent climate of American politics has not yet been sated."

However, the people of Dixie are resilient. They survived Sherman's March, they'll survive this. Most in the South flocked to Earl Kemp Long, younger brother of the late Huey Long. Those that didn't would instead rally around John Nance Garner and his Lone Star republic. Earl worked feverishly to establish governace and order.

Instead, LaGuardia declared New York an independent City State, and the NYPD and City Garrison have come out to defend New York. "

This massive rally has not received the attention it deserves, given its size, but its minor coverage by the press as a whole has come as a result of the view that his rivals, Garner and Norris, are the leading figures in this race."

The liberal wing of the party is pushing to switch Curtis for Landon and to distance ourselves from the Old Guard. Meanwhile, a group of conservative Republicans are pushing both Hoover and the Republican Leadership to run the president again in the upcoming election. The leadership of the Republican Party are still willing to stick with Curtis despite the health concerns, but these whispers must be addressed if he wants to become the next president."

However, in recent days, the Dust Bowl has intensified across these Plain States and now many around the country have called upon Hoover to act to solve this crisis."

It seems that this year will be one that shakes America to its very foundations."

In 1932 Hoover barely won a victory but with the assistence of House and a split vote beat the Democrat Candidate by the slimmest of margins. This phyrric victory, combined the failure of his administration to deal with the crisis at home, has destroyed any credability he had before becoming president."

ustates.4008.desc: "The Palmer Raids were the largest series of raids on our citizens in American history. These raids were ostensibly an attempt to crack down on leftist activists, particularly anarchists. Nearly a decade later, we are facing a  much more profound crisis of rioters, Klan terrorists, Anarchist terrorism, and even Populist paramilitary groups. Secretary of the Interior J. Edgar Hoover has asked Hoover for the same freedom Wilson gave Palmer to end that crisis. Whether or not Hoover will authorize it has yet to be seen, however."

ustates.4016.title: "J Edgar Hoover's New FBI"
ustates.4016.desc: "When J. Edgar Hoover was authorized to do whatever needed to be done to end our current crisis, many within the Executive Branch noticed the lack of resources the FBI was suffering from. Even more noticable was the lack of any real power to go after criminals. The director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, has proposed a massive expansion of the FBI including hiring of more agents, procuring more office buildings, and in general finding more power to go after the criminals and solve this crisis. President Hoover is now left with the choice to either accept Hoover's request and expand this increasingly powerful organization or to deny the request and make do with the resources he has right now."

On one hand, Frank Knox and the Republican establishment are pushing for Hoover to adopt the strategy and message that the Republicans adopted at the Republican National Convention, which called for meeting with the radical elements of the United States and granting them the ability to govern their own territories for now. However, Douglas MacArthur and J. Edgar Hoover have proposed that Hoover adopt the message and strategy that Garner was proposing during the Democratic National Convention which called for going after the radical elements in the United States and bringing said radicals to heel.

ustates.4021.d: "President Herbert Hoover today announced that a hard line would be taken against the SPA strikers, and indeed against any extremist force that seeks to further destabilize America. He has ordered all rioters in the Steel Belt to return home and likewise for all AFP minutemen and ODP militants to stand down before military action is taken. All SPA, AFP, and ODP congressmen walked out of Capitol Hill shortly after, to the jeers of their Republican and Democratic colleagues, thus adding to the sense that the country was nearing a political breaking point."
ustates.4021.a: "We must prepare..."

ustates.4022.t: "Military Action Prepared!"
ustates.4022.d: "Our military is prepared to defend the Republic from the radical factions trying to rip it apart! The only question now is where to use it. Anti-radicals have suggested using the bulk of the military to occupy the syndicalist occupied territories that are still striking, while the cabinet would like to spread our forces more and occupy all three radical areas. George Marshall however would like to split the difference, placing most of our military in the Steel Belt while using counter-espionage in other territories to prevent an immediate revolt, though he warns this will only buy time as they are likely already announcing a revolt against the President's hardline, out of fear that MacArthur will come after them once the SPA is finished"

ustates.4023.d: "Our forces have managed to force back the radical SPA activists and rioters in the Steel Belt. However, the occupation is becoming increasingly difficult as the Red Militants organize against us and go beyond merely taking pot shots at our soldiers. The Cabinet is pushing us to retreat and protect Washington before the SPA forces grow too powerful, but MacArthur and Eisenhower claim they can hold the territory if they are given reinforcements."
ustates.4023.a: "Give them what they need!"
ustates.4023.b: "Fall back!"

ustates.4024.t: "Dealing with the Steel Belt"
ustates.4024.d: "The SPA's attacks have slowed; our reinforced troops have damaged their efforts and even conducted counter attacks on their militia headquarters under the orders of MacArthur and Eisenhower. However, while the Red Militias have weakened and the government has gained legitimacy in the eyes of the citizens of the Steel Belt, the workers have not yet been won over to our side. Many are still refusing to work, even if they are not outright SPA members. Hardliners such as Henry Styles Bridges and J. Parnall Thomas have been encouraged by our recent success and are pushing for us to finish the job by cracking down on the rest of the strikers and unions. This will make it so that our industry can hire new workers and teach the workers not to engage in such behavior. However, Vice President Frank Knox and other cabinet members are pushing for us to cut a deal with industry leaders by raising wages in return for protection from the militias, noting that most of these workers are not natural militants and if they were treated fairly, SPA support could be undercut in the process."

More workers have joined in with the SPA as a result of our perceived weakness in stopping them, and we now lack the forces needed to contain them. With entire platoons of National Guardsmen being overrun by guerilla attacks and larger riots, the situation looks bleak. Barriers are being set up by the Red Militia in the streets of Chicago and Detroit and we have been forced to fall back to Washington D.C. MacArthur is furious at this state of affairs, feeling that victory could was in his reach if only the government hadn't fumbled the situation. Likewise, the Old Democrats are furious that they are being attacked in SPA controlled areas, and many of their supporters are falling back to more southern regions of the Steel Belt."

Barriers are being set up by the Red Militia in the streets of Chicago and Detroit; we have been forced to fallback to Washington DC.

ustates.4035.d: "The ODP is unsurprisingly demanding that we reverse our decision to send troops to the White League-occupied American Southeast alongside various other areas of the nation. Murray has called it 'D.C. tyranny' amongst other things, while John E. Rankin shouted every slur he could seeminly think of in response to the occupation of Mississippi. They are currently stalling as much as possible in Congress and the National Democratic White League under Joseph Simmons has printed newsletters decrying us. While some want us to pull back at once, Douglas MacArthur has demanded we stay and finish the job, and urged that the SPA and AFP must show their loyality to America by having their militias work with federal military officers to support controlling the border regions of the ODP strongholds."

ustates.4036.t: "White Leaguers Strike!"
ustates.4036.d: "A small unit of our men sent to keep the peace in South Carolina have been ambushed while walking the streets of Raleigh, with several White Leaguers opening fire on them with bullets and firebombs. The act was applauded by the notably extreme South Carolina Governor Coleman Blease, an affiliate of the so-called "Old Klan", who has stated that South Carolia will not stand for a "Second Reconstruction" and that retribution is inevitable. Arresting him is likely to incite a revolt but some progressives are pressing us to do so. For what his opinion is worth, MacArthur believes that it would be dangerous to arrest the governor and that it would put his men at further risk."
ustates.4036.a: "Just focus on the White Leagues"
ustates.4036.b: "Arrest Blease"

ustates.4037.t: "Increased Presence Requested"
ustates.4037.d: "While not a fan of our governments agenda, MacArthur was ready to give Norris a chance to follow through on his plans to end the militis. However, the National Democratic White League has been wearing down the army in recent days with its guerilla warfare and political pressuring. MacArthur has demanded increased military funding to keep the NDWL from seizing ODP strongholds, stating that we would be dooming America by not giving into his request."
ustates.4037.a: "That's fair, increase his budget"
ustates.4037.b: "He will have to make do with what he has"

ustates.4049.t: "Steel Belt and South Pacified!"
ustates.4049.d: "With businesses in the Steel Belt agreeing to pay workers more and the army continuing to push back the Red Militias, an increasing number of workers are viewing the Federal government as a more stable source of protection and income than the SPA. With it becoming clear that outright revolt will not succeed, many SPA congressional leaders are listening to their more moderate wing and calling for calmness and an end to hostilities. They note that better conditions can still be negotiated for through Congress. Meanwhile, in the South, the NDWL is decimated, if not outright pacified, and it is likely time to pull out our forces from the region. Staying any longer would only incur hatred after a certain point, and George Marshall claims the occupied states are exhausted, although he advises that we leave behind some men to protect Black and allied regions. However, General Joseph McNarney advises us to pull out altogether."
ustates.4049.a: "Have we saved America?"

ustates.4027.t: "Hoover Announces Negotiations"
ustates.4027.dc: "After his re-election, Hoover had to deal with riots not only in Washington, but also across the rest of the United States. Having now dealt with the riots in Washington D.C, President Hoover has announced that his next priority as president is to end the most recent strike launched by the SPA. To achieve this, he has sent an invitation to Bill Haywood to sit down in Chicago and negotiate a deal. Haywood holds a firm grip over both the IWW and AFL, whom make up the bulk of the general strikers. Secretary MacArthur, along with many other members of the cabinet, are opposed to the talks and see any negotiations as political suicide. Regardless, President Hoover and his top negotiator, Charles Curtis, are determined."
ustates.4027.a: "I won't make Cleveland's mistake"

ustates.4028.t: "Haywood Accepts Hoover's Invitation"
ustates.4028.d: "Bill Haywood has sent word to the government that he has accepted the invitation to negotiate. An FBI intelligence file on Haywood indicates that he and other SPA leaders were worried that their right-wing would defect if he outright turned it down, meaning he is less than thrilled to be present but must make at least a show of quasi-good will. While preparations are being made in Chicago to heighten security, members of the President's cabinet as well as General Douglas MacArthur have expressed their serious misgivings at the entire endeavor. They say he is putting his life in jeopardy, but for now they will wait to see what comes of the meeting."
ustates.4028.a: "Maybe the Republic will survive?"

ustates.4029.t: "Negotiations Begin"
ustates.4029.d: "Hoover gave a speech stating his plan before the negotiations, and while there were very few cheers, the speech did alleviate fears. He noted that "with these negotiations we continue the great American tradition of achieving peace through compromise, progress through understanding, and democracy through mutual agreement. May our efforts today fulfill the spirit of the Constitution and preserve the liberty of all Americans." President Hoover and Bill Haywood have sat down for their historic meeting in Chicago. Midway through the negotiations, word arrived that both Huey Long and (upon hearing of Long's request) William H. Murray have demanded to be present at the negotiations, despite our diplomats already telling them they would be seen after Haywood. Their presence will undoubtedly make negotiations more difficult, possibly scuttling them entirely, but refusing could incite the AFP and ODP to such a degree as to make success in Chicago worthless. Even Haywood himself seems to want them to be present if only to be certain that Hoover will tell them all the same thing without giving the others too much."
ustates.4029.a: "Allow them to participate"
ustates.4029.b: "They have no business here"

ustates.4030.t: "Our Last Choice"
ustates.4030.d: "With Hoover, Knox and Curtis not allowing Long and Murray at the Chicago Negotiations, the FBI have been all alerted the both Long and Murray are going to condemn Hoover and the D.C Establishment for not listening to their desire for autonomy similar to the SPA. While Hoover is off in Chicago, the Choice comes to MacArthur on what to do with this information."
ustates.4030.a: "Order the death of Murray and Long"
ustates.4030.b: "That damnable fool gets what he deserves"

ustates.4032.t: "Desire for Autonomy"
ustates.4032.d: "Haywood, Long, and Murray have made it clear they believe the working man is being stiffed but have wildly different ways of achieving their goals. However, the Home Rule plan aims to allow each to implment their ideas in their respective regions. Haywood demands that we make a show of goodwill by ending all attempts to end the general strike, essentially pulling our forces out of the region. The AFP and ODP have stated that if we are to follow through on such an effort, we will have to do the same for them, and order MacArthur's military forces to stand down. Of course, Haywood nearly blew up the negotations by stating that pulling forces away from ODP strongholds would simply make it easier for the Red Guard to eventually overrun them, but is was a threat Murray simply chuckled at and invited him to try his best. After Long and the President reminded both men that the US Army remained the issue at hand, they thankfully stopped their fighting for the moment."
ustates.4032.a: "Very well"
ustates.4032.b: "They need to make a better offer"

ustates.4033.t: "Compromise Achieved"
ustates.4033.d: "The Home Rule Act of 1937 has passed, with the federal government agreeing to give far more autonomy to SPA states in terms of their economic and social policies in return for dramatically reversing their militia recruitment programs. They must also cease their current strikes, riots, party recruitment in other areas of the country, and most of all, any overtly aggressive action against us. The Socialists are now currently transitioning Chicago and Detroit to semi-syndicalist systems where workers are universally unionized and own shares of production. While many within the cabinet do not like giving them control even to this degree, this level of decentralization has defused the radicals while allowing us to focus on the West and East, regions where the federal government is still most influential. Further, it has given us a chance to eliminate their threat on a national level while giving each major constituency what they want."
ustates.4033.a: "America Saved Through Compromise"

ustates.4034.t: "Breaking the Minutemen and Klan"
ustates.4034.d: "Without the threat of the SPA's revolt, we are now free to focus on other factions. The Klan is a shadow of its former self without the ODP, and the Minutemen and AFP are disorganized with the death of the Kingfish. The time has come to break up these factions to the best of our ability. With the compromise allowing the Unions to establish their own economics in the Red Belt, we are unlikely to hear any anger towards the Federal Government in breaking up these two groups."
ustates.4034.a: "Hoover has the all-clear"

#Hoovernomics
ustates.4015.t: "The Social Security and Housing Act"
ustates.4015.d: "The Social Security Act is an act written by Robert F. Wagnar, taking clear influences from Francis Townsend in the AFP. Due to this, while it got some support from the AFP memebers of Congress in 1935, Republicans, Conservative Democrats and the Old Democrat Party members called the Bill too radical. The members of the Socialist Party and radicals of the AFP, meanwhile, called the Bill too moderate. As such, it failed to pass through Congress in 1935. However with the shift in American politics, Senator Wagner has seen another chance to attempt ot pass this act, and along with this bill, he has brought forward what he is calling the House Act. This would allow subsidies to be paid from the US government to local public housing agencies to improve living conditions for the impoverished of this great nation. Hoover has the political capital to attempt to back the act and hopefully alleviate some of the damages of the Great Depression. Otherwise, we must hope for some miracle to solve this crisis."

ustates.4060.t: "Dealing with the Great Depression?"
ustates.4060.d: "The Great Depression could be felt as far back as 1925, but when the Stock Market Crash of 1928 occured, the crisis was clear for everyone to see. Hoover spent the his entire first term attempting every policy he could think of to try and solve this crisis. However, when his 1932 victory in the House of Representatives made his mandate as President far weaker, it was clear he needed to do better. Hoover has once again has come back to try and solve this crisis. With Knox's help, the budget has been balanced. However several options now lay before Hoover with this clean slate economy. McNary and the Progressive Caucus are calling for Hoover to listen to them and once more continue economic interventionism. Meanwhile, the liberals of the Republican and Democrat Party are advocating a similar stance to the progressives, but to a far lesser degree, along with attempting to maintain the balanced budget. Establishment Republicans like Charles Curtis are advising Hoover to embrace their idea of a 'Work Sharing Plan', which would compensate Americans for their hours lost via partial unemployment subsidy, and the last option on Hoover's Desk is performing austerity measures that the conservative Democrats and Republicans have pushed for. This would mean more cuts on the budget to show businesses that we live in a fiscally responsible nation."

However Hoover has a chance to try and fix the problem with now the Knox has pushed forward his balance budget. The Democrat in the House and Senate have pushed for more rural investments to these devestated plain state, the Establishment and Conservative Republicans are pushing for more tariffs to protect both our Farmers and Workers just like what has been done before, the Liberal Republicans are calling for Hoover to embrace the competition Free Trade which they believe won't solve problem of the dust bowl but would lower costs for the food in America and help Americans overall, and Senator McNary in which this plan would implement higher domestic prices for local farm products in order to help our Farmers."

However, through the good and bad of Hoover's third term, he has guided the nation away from the cliff and saved American democracy, the Republic, and American society itself. Washington's politics is begining the change as Hoover's popularity soars, and the paradigm of American politics is changing as many attempt to find their place in the new America"

ustates.4101.desc: "Ever since the Progressive split and Wilson's Victory in 1912, the Republican Party has been on the losing side of American politics. Their best attempts to regain the White House have been met with failure. With Hoover's victory in 1928, however, there was a reversal in the party's fortunes. In the years after that election, the Republican Party once again began to lose favor as people turned against the party and blamed Hoover for the depression in some cases. With his victories in 32' and 36' destabilizing the country once again, everyone, including President Hoover himself, thought that the Union was done. However the Union was not done, and President Hoover along with his supporters in the cabinet, Congress and the military were able to turn the crisis around. Now the question is: what will become of the Republican Party now?"

ustates.4105.fourth: "Since Mckinley's victory over William Jennings Bryan in 1896, we have been stuck with the after effects of his victory and the Progressive Era. What was shown in this era was that third parties can not only just survive in American politics, but can thrive in some cases such as the Progressive Party. With Hoover's decision to attempt to hold the Republican Party in the center of American politics, not leaning further Right or Left, the Progressive and Democratic Parties have filled those niches for the Party. It seems this era of three parties, one Left Wing, one Right wing and another advocating centrism in American politics, will go on longer....."
ustates.4105.fifthpartyleft: "With Hoover's victory in the 1932' and later 1936' elections, you have seen a shift in American politics. The Progressive Party has been slowly re-absorbed back into the Republican Party fold, and many attribute this to Hoover's use of the economic Progressive policies that were advocated for by the Progressive ticket in 1936. Hoover now finds himself on the furthest right of the Republican Party, with some of his former allies that got him the nomination as the Republican candidate of 1936 having flipped over to the Democratic Party or feeling betrayed by Hoover and declaring themselves independents. This new era of American politics seems like it will be dominated by a Left-wing Republican Party and Right-Wing Democrat Party....."
ustates.4105.fifthpartyright: "With Hoover's victory in the 1932' and later 1936 elections, you have seen a shift in American politics. The Democratic Party that has survived since the days of Andrew Jackson has been slowly absorbed by the Republican party, and many have attributed this to Hoover's tougher stance against the radicals across the United States. Such a stance was originally advocated for by the Democratic ticket of 1936. Hoover now finds himself in the center of a party shifting further right, and many of his former allies that got him the nomination to be the Republican candidate of 1936 cheer the 'Grand Old Man' and his great success. This new era of American Politicis seems like it will be dominated by a Left-wing Progressive Party and Right-Wing Republican Party....."
ustates.4102.secondera: "The Era of Good Feelings occured all the way back in 1817. It occured due to the collapse of the Federalist party, and was an era of low partisanship, along with less partisan affiliation by the public. Many are wondering now if that has begun to occur again, as President Hoover focuses his third-term as the President around national unity and downplaying partisan politics. He achieved this through his adoption of policies from both the Right and Left of American politics, along with his work in bringing the Progressive, Republican and Democratic Parties all closer together. Over this third term, there has been a collapse of the mainstream Progressive and Democratic Parties along with former Progressives, Democrats, SPA, AFP, and ODP memeber joining the Republican Party. It seems Hoover has brought out a greater sense of National Unity and a new era of good feelings to the United States. Hopefully, this will last forever....."

Pressured to be the nominee of the Republican Party in 1936 by its conservative wing, and having raised his popularity with the public to heights not seen since his victory in 1928, Hoover has done what no other man could achieve.

ustates.5002.desc: "Making good on its promise to restore \"the natural racial order in America\", the new NPP government has convened a panel of \"experts\" in the field of racialism at a national convention meant to formulate and promulgate racial policy in America going forward. Firstly there is William Dudley Pelley, with his metaphysical and spiritual approach to race. Next there is Samuel Green, representing the interests of the Ku Klux Klan and traditional nativist movements. Finally, there is Lothrop Stoddard, representing the new Scientific Racialist current that has been embraced by the elites of the East Coast. Each of these men has accrued considerable support for their agenda, and it looks like they and their supporters will all hold firm in maintaining the current deadlock if no outside force intervenes. \n\nFor this reason, the initiative is now on the [USA.GETLeader] administration to intervene by favoring one of the camps, giving their proposal the support needed to become official policy. All that remains is to determining which of the three groups is most deserving of our backing."

ustates.5003.title: "Pursuing Japanese Repatriation"
ustates.5003.desc: "While Asian Exclusion has been a policy of the United States for some years now, the Japanese have always been subjected to rules somewhat different to those applied on all the other nations of Asia. Japan is the only Great Power on the continent and has long wished to be seen as equal to its White counterparts compromising the rest of the Great Powers. For these and other reason, the policy of the United State for many years was to not explicitly restrict the inflow of Japanese immigrants, and instead to formulate a Gentleman's Agreement with the Empire, where they preserved their honor and in return they stopped Japanese from ever boarding ships to America. \n\nThis policy has failed. While the Japanese claim to be doing their best to prevent their citizens from immigrating to America, the population of Japanese in America has continued to grow precipitously with no sign of abating, especially with the grow of a significant population of 2nd generation Japanese-Americans. For this reason, there has long been a call to take additional action to prevent this growth,\"lest the West Coast be overrun\". At the same time, Japan's power is only growing, and consequently, there are many in our government who argue it would be better to accept the presence of the Japanese as a fait accompli, rather than run the risks of upsetting their homeland. What shall we do?"
ustates.5003.a: "Asiatics belong in Asia. Send them back."
ustates.5003.b: "The Japanese have integrated into America society. They stay."

ustates.5004.title: "Repealing Prohibition?"
ustates.5004.desc: "As one of the most impactful pieces of social policy enacted by the Norris government, Prohibition has become a deeply controversial political issue within America. Uniquely however, there are many in the NPP who agree with the policy. Prohibition has long been an issue for which many on the hard right have campaigned, and whose enactment even they had to grudgingly congratulate Norris on. As a result, a significant section of the party will remain ironclad in their opposition to amending or remove Prohibition, regardless of what else we might say about liberty and personal freedom. \n\nWhile we may still be able to push through a repeal of Prohibition anyway, success might well prove to be a poisoned chalice thereafter. What should we do?"
ustates.5004.a: "Prohibition needlessly restricts freedoms, it will be repealed."
ustates.5004.b: "Prohibition is a moral necessity, it stays."

ustates.5005.title: "The Death of Jack Reed"
ustates.5005.desc: "While returning from a meeting with his remaining political allies, Jack Reed and his wife Louise Bryant were ambushed by unknown assailants who unloaded dozens of rounds at the couple before escaping. Though the authorities were quick to respond, Reed was pronounced dead at the scene. Upon being rushed to the hospital, Bryant was miraculously found to not face any life-threatening injuries and is expected to soon make a full recovery. \n\nUnsurprisingly, such a blatant political assassination, even one of a red agitator, has raised an outcry throughout the nation. The clamor for justice is being broadcast throughout America, and it now falls on us to. How shall we proceed?"
ustates.5005.a: "Arrange a serious investigation, regardless of what we find."
ustates.5005.b: "Arrest the usual suspects, this is probably just Red infighting."

ustates.5006.title: "Louise Bryant condemns us"
ustates.5006.desc: "Since her recovery from the wounds she sustained during the assassination of her husband, Louise Bryant has conducted a continuous campaign against our government. Blaming us for his death, and even claiming that some in our cabinet had a direct hand in organizing the killing, her vitriol has been both incessant and intense. While her and her late husband’s Red tendencies engender a health suspicion of her claims in most Americans, a growing number of especially naïve individuals have fallen for Bryant’s falsehoods. \n\nGiven that she shows no signs of stopping, there are many in the government who suggest we should step in to end her campaign. However, with Jack Reed’s murder so fresh in the public memory, acting against Bryant would be controversial at best. What should we do?"
ustates.5006.a: "Hysteria after loss is unfortunate but commonplace. Let her rave for now."
ustates.5006.b: "She may be a widow, but that’s no excuse for spewing such bile. Shut her down."

ustates.5007.title: "Are we to be America's penal colony?"
ustates.5007.desc: "The actions of [USA.GetLeader] in America have recently laid the groundwork for what may become a diplomatic incident between our two nations. As part of their nativist campaign, the [USA.GetLeader] administration have deported a number of perceived radicals, nominally to their nations of origin. However, when dealing with the leftist black agitators, the Americans instead chose to dump them on our shores, citing their Pan-Africanist ideology. Naturally, the insinuation that they have anything to with the Amero-Liberian people or our nation has proven deeply offensive to us all. One member of the TWP best summarized our sentiment by attacking the notion that \"a nation founded by the adopted sons and daughters of the old American elite should become the custodians of every criminal Negro in the Americas.\". \n\nNevertheless, we must be conscious of our situation, and act accordingly. The fate of our nation will always depend on a good relation with the Americans, whether we like it or not. Consequently, it may be better to let the slight pass for the sake of good relations, and use this surge of support for repatriationism to good ends. While the Americans may have sent their scum over this time, with some effort, we will hopefully be able spur a second round of colonial settlement in Liberia, and cement our dominance over both the hinterland and its tribes."
ustates.5007.a: "Cooperate with the Americans on the issue, and forward a proposal for a productive repatriation plan."
ustates.5007.b: "Demand an apology for this behavior."

ustates.5008.title: "Liberia Demands an Apology"
ustates.5008.desc: "The Liberian government has expressed its strong disapproval with our government's policy, criticizing our practice of dumping undesirables on their shores. They demand an end to the practice, and an apology for past behavior. Nevertheless, they seem to have recognized who they are dealing with, and made concessions accordingly. An apology will not mean taking back those already sent to Liberia, where the state has pledged to deal with them. \n\nThis consideration is doubly useful, as the incident has now made it into the press, and become a political issue. Some of our more zealous supporters are outraged by this perceived insult and demand a flat rejection of the Liberian demands. At the same time, Black Nationalists and Businesses with interests in Liberia have called for our government to make amends, to restore a damaged reputation in the country. What shall we do?"
ustates.5008.a: "Intransigency and pride won't fix bad press. Apologize."
ustates.5008.b: "America does as it pleases, and makes no apologies for it."

ustates.5009.title: "Liberia Proposes Black Repatriation"
ustates.5009.desc: "We have recently been contacted by preacher-politician Earnest Sevier Cox, with a most intriguing proposal. Claiming to represent a coalition of true segregationists and Black Nationalists like Marcus Garvey, alongside acting as agent for the Liberian government, he has proposed a national scheme of Black repatriation. While the exact nature of his service for the Liberian government is unclear, they have been quick to affirm their general support for the scheme. And with a broad base of support for the plan in America, it seems repatriation has never been more likely. \n\nNevertheless, we have encountered firm opposition from traditional Dixiecrats and other so-called moderate Segregationists. Citing the important role of Blacks in the Southern economy, and determined to preserve the present social order, they have proved a source of stiff opposition. While we will be able to move ahead with the plan despite this, it would be at a significant political cost and possibly cripple our administration's efforts. Are we willing to take such a gamble?"
ustates.5009.a: "Approve the plan and starting working towards implementation."
ustates.5009.b: "The ex-Dixiecrat establishment shoot down the plan."

ustates.5010.title: "Americans Refuse Repatriation"
ustates.5010.desc: "The Americans have turned down our proposal for Black repatriation, citing the cost of the plan. We have also heard rumors that the decision was motivated by Dixiecrat pressure to safeguard the economic order in the South. Either way, repatriation will not take place now or some time to come."
ustates.5010.a: "Damn it."

ustates.5011.title: "The Nature of Black Repatriation"
ustates.5011.desc: "With support secured for the repatriation plan, we must now determine its shape. To this end, Senator Theodore Bilbo has recently provided a plan for repatriation in the form of a bill before the Senate. However, the fundamental cost and logistical challenges of the project remains an active issue, which our opponents have continued to use against the plan. As a result, a less ambitious and more \"practical\" alternative has been proposed. This would involve the repatriation of only a number of UNIA volunteers, to test the waters for broader repatriation down the line. \n\nSenator Bilbo has actively spoken against the plan, proclaiming it \"a half measure at best, and a scheme to delay full repatriation at worst.\" As tensions rise, a clear split has formed, with roughly even support for the two plans, and its anyone's guess which will be implemented."
ustates.5011.a: "Our Moses, Theodore Bilbo's initiative succeeds!"
ustates.5011.b: "Garvey and his diehards are forced to go it alone."

ustates.5012.title: "Black Migrants Arrive"
ustates.5012.desc: "With the passage of the Bilbo Bill, hundreds of thousands of Black Americans have begun the process of leaving their birth country to find their fortune in Liberia. With the support of the NPP administration, we have been able to make them welcome in their new nation, integrating them into the economy and using their numbers to cement Americo-Liberian pre-eminence amongst the people of Liberia. With more on the way, and a deepening of trade relations with the Americans, we can look forward to a prosperous future."
ustates.5012.a: "The dream of a Black homeland is at last in reach."

ustates.5013.title: "Garveyite Settlers Arrive"
ustates.5013.desc: "While the Bilbo Bill may have failed, that has not ended the dream of African-American colonization of Liberia. With what limited support the NPP government can offer, Marcus Garvey and his UNIA followers have arrived on our shores, with the promise of more arrivals to come. The use these able bodied men will be able to provide in our military endeavors is clear, and Garvey looks to be a formidable chief to lead them. "

With the Populist Party now in power, the time has come to determine how we shall punish these actions. The party's left-wing believe that the behavior of the Oligarchs was an attempted takeover of the government, and should be treated as nothing short of treason. On the other hand, the party's right-wing feel that such a radical course of action could endanger the government's position, and stands contrary to our effort to unite all Americans, and that conventional punishment via fines and jail time should be sought instead."

Special focus has been placed on Wall Street, which has long been synonymous with the financial order. Now that we have pushed through the relevant legislation, it would be trivial to find a justification for evicting the current occupants and celebrating our victory over them.

While the Garner administration had already made significant progress by arresting much of the organization's national leadership, they failed to suppress it at the grassroots level, which allowed it to reform as a number of local organizations. It is these groups which we worked to break up, especially by apprehending many of the \"small fish\" to whom the FBI had previously turned a blind eye.

Unsurprisingly, this opposition has turned out to be nothing more than a last, clawing attempt to protect themselves. What we did not expect was the sheer extent to which the Southern Democrats would be linked to lynchings, voter suppression and any number of other crimes. For all their protestations of innocence or of circumstantial evidence, we knew the truth and we acted. \n\nNow, all that remains is to determine our course going forward.

And while the work of the bureau in repressing the activities of the KKK must be acknowledged, it is a deeply worrying fact that this work began with an investigation that the Bureau's Chief had never obtained permission to undertake. \n\nFortuitously, we have recently come into information that has greatly strengthened our position. It was revealed to us via photographic evidence that the Director himself secretly engages in the most debauched and degenerate homophile behavior and has done so for some years. Recognizing the use of this information, we were able to obtain Hoover's resignation in return for handing over the compromising photos. With the ex-Director out of the way, we can now appoint a more loyal individual to his place, to spearhead our effort to once again subordinate the FBI to the federal government.

While their duty charges them with safeguarding the principles of the constitution from legislative encroachment without heed to political agenda or affiliation, the reality is much different. The court has long been a thoroughly partisan institution with a broadly anti-reformist agenda. Never has this been more true than now, as the justices have now made common cause with the rump opposition to delay, damage and dismantle our policy in any way possible. \n\nWith all other options and appeals exhausted, we will now have to take radical measures. If they want to play dirty, we'll be more than their match in that field. Two proposals have been made to this end. The first calls for the enlargment of the court to ensure a comfortable majority of supporters to rubber-stamp our legislation. The second calls for the same, and impressing on the existing justices the \"censure\" that will be imposed on wrong verdicts going forward. Which shall we choose?"
ustates.6009.a: "The right size."
ustates.6009.b: "...and the right verdicts."

ustates.6010.title: "The Fate of the Electoral College"
ustates.6010.desc: "The Electoral College was designed in a much different time in American history, as one of a number of mechanisms for balancing the interests of the founding states. However, the evolution of our nation and advances, both in urbanization and technology have made the college not only archaic, but actively counterproductive. Small states with smaller populations wield disproportionate electoral power, while the urban masses' votes are discounted in worth. In addition, the lack of punishment for faithless electors means that even when comparatively disenfranchised voters succeed in making their voice heard, their electors can ignore their wishes and accord their votes to another candidate, without fear of censure. \n\nAs a result, it has become abundantly clear that Electoral College reform is sorely needed. The only question left is whether we should take a moderate or more aggressive approach. The first would involve penalizing faithless electors nation-wide, with punishments up to and including imprisonment, while still retaining the college as a concession to smaller states. The second would involve the outright abolition of the college, even if angers those in the rural states, for the general furtherance of democracy in the nation. What is our decision?"
ustates.6010.a: "Penalize Faithless Electors."
ustates.6010.b: "Abolish the College entirely."

ustates.6011.title: "The Second Constitutional Convention"
ustates.6011.desc: "While our reforms have been extensive and successful, they are none the less limited by clear legal barriers. The most obvious of these are the Constitution, drafted centuries ago, and broadly unfit for the current circumstance. While some claim that to dispense with the vision of the founders is tantamount to heresy, we know it is madness to allow ourselves to be ruled by the precepts of flawed men from a bygone age. \n\nFor this reason, we will call a second constitutional convention, to draft a guiding document that is both popular and serves the interests of the proletariat."
ustates.6011.a: "Begin the drafting process."

ustates.6012.title: "General Bradley's Coup"
ustates.6012.desc: "Citing [USA.GETLeader]'s revolutionary policies as a threat to the very fabric of the nation, a movement within the military led by General Omar Bradley has launched a coup, with the explicit goal of \"saving America from the radicals\". While Smedley Butler and various figures on the left have managed to raise popular resistance to prevent the immediate success of the coup, they are ill-prepared and equipped. In addition, many of the organs of state have thus far sat on the sidelines, or actively sided with Bradley and his men. Confusion reigns on Capitol Hill and the location of President [GetLeader] is unclear, with members of his administration giving unclear and contradictory instructions to the public. \n\nDespite the grim outlook for the government at present, the Bradley movement's loss of the element of surprise may well prove their undoing. As the situation develops, reports are coming out suggesting that..."
ustates.6012.a: "[USA.GETLeader] and the government have managed to cling on."

nimatron.1.d: "The coming of the Second American Civil War had led Edward Condon, a nuclear physicist, to have plenty of spare time on his hands. Westinghouse Electric has brought to the purview of many American cities the Nimatron, an invention of the previously mentioned Edward Condon. Rather than providing economic or tactical significance, it instead provides endless entertainment. It's able to simulate a game of Nim, where it takes the role of one of the players. The player can turn off one or more bulbs in a row, then the machine takes a turn doing the same, and so on. The last to extinguish a light is the winner. A person who beats the machine, no easy feat, will receive a coin minted with the phrase ''Nim Champion''. Due to its novelty and the prospect of a albeit minor reward, it has become very popular as a means to both spend time and also forget about the troubles of reconstruction."
nimatron.1.a: "Little by little, our future gets a bit brighter."

nimatron.6.t: "A Bone-afide Discovery"
nimatron.6.d: "While on a paleontological dig in northern Arizona that spared no expense, paleontologist Charles L. Camp along with Navajo naturalist Jesse Williams made an exciting new discovery. Digging at the Kayenta Formation just 20 miles north of Tuba City on the Navajo Reservation, the group dug up three different sets of fossilized remains of a new carnivorous dinosaur. One skeleton was a largely complete and in-tact fossilized skeleton with only the front of the skull, parts of the pelvis, and some vertebrae missing, while the other two were far more eroded and fragmentary. Taken to the University of California Museum of Paleontology for study, the specimen has been tentatively named ‘Dilophosaurus wetherilli’ and is described as a medium sized predatory theropod hailing from the Early Jurassic period, with an estimated size of around 23 feet long and adorned with a distinct two-pointed crest atop its head. Some have even speculated it may have had a large frill and even was venomous, but these ideas have been largely decried. The discovery has been hailed as a miracle of science after the recent chaos in America, for such an atmosphere has made science hard to pursue. May this be a sign of better things to come."
nimatron.6.a: "What an odd specimen. It will surely deepen our knowledge overtime, and perhaps even entertain the masses."

nimatron.7.t: "Jimmy Stewart Does His Duty"
nimatron.7.d: "Already a household name for his roles in ‘Small Town Girl’, ‘After the Thin Man’, and ‘You Can’t Take It With You’, which managed to squeeze out a release despite the onset of the Civil War, Jimmy Stewart - actor, playboy, everyman, and star - is one of the biggest actors in Hollywood, but even this star of the silver screen could not ignore the call of the brother war that was tearing this nation apart. Temporarily retiring from his acting career, Jimmy Stewart has enlisted with the United States Army, seeking a position in the Army Air Corp given his personal flight experience. Not a stranger to flight, Stewart has been piloting small aircraft since he was a teen, and for further military experience, both his grandfather’s served the Union in the first Civil War while his father served in the Spanish-American War. \n\nSeeking to utilize him for his skill as well as his ability to be a great tool for propaganda and the war effort, the Federal Government has moved to offer Stewart an officership, citing his flight experience and high marks received at Princeton University. Though he may be a bit green, it is no secret America needs able men in command now more than ever before, and so Stewart as well as Army Command have agreed to the proposition. Stewart shall become a commissioned officer in the US Army while also starring in a series of Army-funded videos in an attempt to boost morale, where he will hopefully become an able asset to both our ground and air forces as we fight to win this civil war."
nimatron.7.a: "The epitome of the American ideal. We salute this brave American."

nimatron.8.t: "Winning Your Wings"
nimatron.8.d: "As the first Hollywood star to enlist in the Second American Civil War, Jimmy Stewart - now an established officer in the Army Air Corp and fighter ace in his own right - has become one of the biggest stars in America, for he has risen to become not only the face of the pre-War movie scene, but the face of the war itself as well. Starring in his latest wartime film, titled ‘Winning Your Wings’, Stewart plays himself in a propagandizing and informational puff picture aimed at boosting soldier morale, driving up enlistment numbers, and cleaning up the image of our armed forces in the eyes of the public. Though some of his contemporaries in Hollywood call him a sell out, the nation calls him a patriot! For they know the truth, and as do we - Jimmy Stewart is an American hero!"
nimatron.8.a: "God bless Jimmy Stewart!"

nimatron.9.t: "It’s a Wonderful Life!"
nimatron.9.d: "Directed by Frank Capra and starring Jimmy Stewart in his first post-Civil War role alongside the darling starlet Donna Reed, ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ has finally been released to theatres nationwide. Instantly becoming a smash hit and already being nominated for numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture, this heartfelt and lovely tale is based on the novel ‘The Greatest Gift’ by Philip Van Doren Stern, which itself is loosely based upon Dickens’ ‘A Christmas Carol.’ \nFollowing George Bailey - played by the beloved Jimmy Stewart - the film opens on Christmas Day in 1945 as Bailey contemplates suicide in his home in New York City when an angel named Clarence hears his pleas and his assigned to save him. The film then goes on as Bailey is shown how his life - and eventually how his non-existence - affects both loved ones, family, and adversaries until he finds his will to live once more. Ending on a happy note, Bailey is reunited with his friends and family as they gather enough money to cover his debts, and the once-depressed man finally realizes he has a wonderful life. \n\nReigniting Jimmy Stewart’s acting career while also proving to be a smash hit in of itself, and despite claims from the FBI that it may harbor Syndicalist undertones, ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ is sure to be a classic that endures for decades. "
nimatron.9.a: "An American Christmas classic for the ages."

nimatron.10.t: "The Thunderbird of the WASPs"
nimatron.10.d: "With the WASP program in full-swing, women aviators have been taking to the sky across America. Though most women taking to the air are from affluent White families themselves, Ola Mildred Rexroat is one deviation from this norm. The only woman of Indigenous blood to serve in the WASPs, Ola Mildred Rexroat is half-White, half-Oglala Lakota and a Kansas native that has made a name for herself as an unmatched fighter ace and air-traffic controller. After training on PT-19 and BT-13 trainer aircraft, the fly girl Rexroat has gone on to fly well over a dozen combat missions, forging her into a true terror of the skies. With her callsign ‘Thunderbird’ in reference to the legendary creature of Lakota myth, Rexroat flies her Republic P-47 to great effect, winning countless dogfights and running numerous successful ground attack runs without hesitation. A true patriot, a true American, and a true ace, Rexroat and others like her stand as a striking reminder that there is a role in this war for everyone, no matter their background."
nimatron.10.a: "May her wings take her towards the Great Mystery and beyond."

nimatron.11.t: "The Colonel in White"
nimatron.11.d: "Word has been abuzz across the great state of Utah and beyond recently over a hot, new fried chicken restaurant that has been attracting patrons from across the western states. Named ‘Kentucky Fried Chicken’, the new establishment is the first franchising branch-out attempted by the ‘Colonel’ himself, Harland Sanders. Born in Corbin, Kentucky in 1890 and first selling his now-famous chicken at a roadside stand during the Great Depression, Sanders has spent decades perfecting his fried chicken recipe, with its signature ‘12 Herbs and Spices.’ Though not running this new franchise himself, loathing both the idea of deep-frying the chicken as opposed to pan-frying it as well as despising the idea of making it a chain, the Colonel sold the rights to his good friend Pete Harmann whose restaurant uses the Colonel’s recipe nonetheless. With it, Harmann and Sanders have earned the adoration, or addiction, of the masses while also making a clean profit as well. Word has been circulating that other franchises may open up in other locations across Utah and the wider nation soon as the country is seemingly hit with fried chicken-fever!"
nimatron.11.a: "It’s finger lickin’ good."

nimatron.12.t: "Novel Solutions to Solve the Shell Shock Problem"
nimatron.12.d: "As the Second American Civil War has raged, the psychological phenomena first documented during the Great War known as ‘Shell Shock’ or Neurasthenia has become ever-more common. Thought to be a form of immense psychological and mental trauma caused by the effects of living around constant artillery shelling, gunfire, explosions, and general violent death, Shell Shock and other forms of post-traumatic stress disorders have quickly begun to be a leading cause for soldier hospitalizations and Section-8 orders. \n\nLuckily for America, our leading eggheads and doctors have been hard at work developing solutions and cures for this tragic ailment. From the usage of electrical impulses and shock therapy to the application of general anesthesia like ether or chloroform, there exists a variety of possible cures, though the effects and efficacy varies greatly on a case by case basis. One novel method of soothing the affliction that has garnered national attention is to have attractive and buxom nurses care for the afflicted men, soothing their needs and caring for them while using simple arousal tactics in an attempt to make the soldiers simply forget their trauma. Though the effectiveness of this particular treatment is hotly debated, it has certainly gotten many veterans at least more open to receiving treatment. Soon, we shall hopefully be able to get all our shell shocked men up and attem once more!"
nimatron.12.a: "Sign me up for the trenches!"

nimatron.13.t: "The Face of America’s Triumvirate"
nimatron.13.d: "Like the unofficial partnership of Pompey, Crassus, and the great Julius Caesar, or the coalition of Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus, our new Rome is guided by the Triumvirate. Staffed by the leading heroes of our fight to save America, the Triumvirate under the leadership of Douglas MacArthur, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Omar Bradley now guides these re-United States back towards humility, peace, prosperity, and the Americanist ideals of liberty and order. However, though these three titans of our armed forces rule side-by-side as one body, naturally one will rise to become dominant. As we prepare to enter this new age for the American people, a main face for the Triumvirate and its direction must be chosen internally. \n\nMacArthur, if chosen to continue holding his dominant position, is expected to continue his hardline stances and his deep dedication to American militarism and Conservatism, though will likely have to soften some of his rougher edges to align with the realities of post-war life. Rallying around less divisive and war-mongering ideas are Eisenhower and Bradley, who both share goals of limiting our militarist reality to an extent as we shift to care for the American people and heal the Union. \n\nBradley espouses a return to good ol’ fashioned Christian Americanism and moderate Conservatism, especially seen in his recent quote ‘We have men of science; too few men of God. We have grasped the mystery of the atom and rejected the Sermon on the Mount. Man is stumbling blindly through a spiritual darkness while toying with the precarious secrets of life and death. The world has achieved brilliance without wisdom, power without conscience. Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants. We know more about war than we know about peace, more about killing than we know about living.’ Sharing similar ideas of greatly limiting the military-industrial complex while expanding care for the masses, Eisenhower - or ‘Ike’ as he is affectionately known by his supporters - seeks a more secular and open return to American ideas of Liberal Conservatism still tied to the armed forces but without letting the military dominate America’s needs and desires. \n\nDespite who shall become the face of the Triumvirate, these three true American heroes and proud veterans shall guide the nation together as we finally begin to heal and move on from this chaotic and bloody era."
nimatron.13.a: "The true American Caesar and the man who saved America. We stand with Mac!"
nimatron.13.b: "We still like Ike! Eisenhower is our man!"
nimatron.13.c: "It is time that we steered by the stars! All the way with Bradley!"

nimatron.3.t: "Death of William "Big Bill" Haywood"
nimatron.3.d: "Today one of the Titans of the Industrial Workers of the World, William 'Big Bill' Haywood, long time leader of the Socialist Party of America and unifier of the American Left, passed away after tripping on his dog's leash while walking through Chicago's Lincoln Park. His death has shaken the nation's left to its core. Elizabeth Gurley Flynn spoke at the funeral saying 'History has a long-range perspective. It ultimately passes stern judgment on tyrants and vindicates those who fought, suffered, were imprisoned, and died for human freedom, against political oppression and economic slavery.'\n\nMany other leaders within various Union organizations also spoke at his funeral as well as leaders within the Socialist Party of America. The most noteworthy speech, though, was given by Jack Reed, who ended his speech with some of Haywood's quotes. He reminded the audience that 'If the workers are organized, all they have to do is to put their hands in their pockets and they have got the capitalist class whipped. A strike is an incipient revolution. Many large revolutions have grown out of a small strike. Remember that you are fighting more than your own fight. You are fighting for the entire working class and you must stand together'.\n\nWith Haywood's sudden death, the Socialist Party and its many allies across the political spectrum have been taken aback, and the leadership of the SPA, CSA, IWW and ALF-CIO have called for a joint Congress, in hopes of finding a man to fill Haywood's incredibly large shoes. This Congress comes on the face of increasing calls of a turn to reform instead of revolution, due to the passing of the political crisis that marked the dawn of 1937."
nimatron.3.a: "The end of an era, or the beginning of one?"

nimatron.4.t: "Emergency Congress of the Socialist Party of America"
nimatron.4.d: "Today marks the end of the Emergency Party Congress called by the leadership of America's far-left following the death of their long time leader, William Haywood. The Congress itself was a simple enough affair, with delegates from across the nation, and even representatives from the both the Union of Britain and the Commune of France in attendance. As with most party congresses, the revelation of factional differences came all too early, although unlike most congresses, these factions were broadly split into two camps.\n\nThe first and largest of these factions, mostly belonging to the ranks of the AFL-CIO and the few progressives in attendance, called for a drastic change in policy. Instead of advocating and working directly for Revolution, these delegates fought for change to reformism, working within the system to reform capitalism. This faction agured the point by stating the obvious, the situation in America was much different then in 1936. By and large, the people, save for the most ardent revolutionaries, had calmed, and a sense of national brotherhood and normality had been restored. If the Party truly wished to see socialism, they must work with this new era, and drop the most overt calls for revolution. The second and smaller faction, made up of the CSA, Fosterites and the remnants of the CPUSA, rejected the call for reformism outright, naming those who supported it counter-revolutionaries. The faction simply called for the maintenance of the status quo, with some of the more radical members calling for a sudden uprising against the Old Order.\n\nAs the congress went on, it was clear that the reformists had it in the bag. Thus, the SPA's party program was officially changed, with all usage of revolutionary language being dropped in favor of a more reformist tone. As for the new chairman, John 'Jack' Reed was elected, seemingly as a compromise candidate. John Reed has long something of a pariah within the American Left. Be it his constant flip flopping between supporting Leninist communism or Communard-style Syndicalism, or his failed career as a journalist, it seems the only reason Reed was elected was due to his long time association with the revolutionary faction within the SPA's coalition. Regardless of the reason, the American Left has a new face, and a new program to boot."

nimatron.5.t: "10 Men that Shook my Wife"
nimatron.5.d: "Following a celebration party at her home following her husband's elevation to chairman of the Socialist Party of America, Louise Bryant, in a drunken spiel to a reporter she was with, claims to have been having an affair with at least ten of the most influential Syndicalist intellectuals of our time! In great detail, Bryant spoke of her trysts with Eugene O'Neil, Andrew Dasburg, William C. Bullitt Jr., Al Capone, Eugene V. Debs, Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman together, Norman Thomas, and, during the Russian Civil War, Lavrentiy Beria, Leon Trotsky, and even Georgy Zhukov. Attempts to reach out to these individuals have been met with silence thus far.\n\nCritics of Reed, from both within and without the Socialist Party, have used this as proof of the long rumored status of Reed as a cuckold. Those critics within the Socialist Party say this is proof of Reed's slide into bourgeois tendencies, while those on the right use it as evidence of the degeneracy that follows in the wake of Socialism. Either way, Reed's already weak public image has been completely shattered, even further reducing his and the Socialist Party's likely hood of ever winning any election again."

#USA's Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################

USA_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 26 January, 1880, in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Douglas 'Big Chief' MacArthur, born from a long family line of military men, graduated from West Point as an Engineer Corps second lieutenant in 1903 with the highest grade in the academy's history. In 1904, he was promoted to first lieutenant and travelled to the Philippines in order to help his father with the construction of their headquarters. Through his father's influence, MacArthur quickly became a military advisor to President Theodore Roosevelt until 1908, where he took command of an engineer company in Fort Leavenworth, reaching the rank of Captain in 1911. All these high profile postings allowed him to join the American General Staff in 1912, at the young age of 32. MacArthur took part in the occupation of Veracruz, learning Spanish in a matter of weeks and taking part in several small skirmishes with the rebels. He returned to America in 1919, when he was assigned as the Director of the United States' Military Academy at West Point. In 1922, he returned to the Philippines, this time to inspect the island's defence status, and having to intervene personally to end mutiny of Philippino scouts. With his promotion to Major General in 1925, his notoriety only grew and grew, being sent to the 1928 Olympic games in the Netherlands to head the American Olympic Committee. However, MacArthur was also forced to comply with orders he didn't agree with, like the court martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, which MacArthur has called 'one of the most distasteful orders I ever received'. During the 'Bonus March', MacArthur was forced, under President Hoover's orders, to put down the 'Bonus Army' despite MacArthur's agreeing with the protestors' demands. He has since then become the highest ranking American Officer, although he has had a troubled relation with the government's executive branch.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a family that fought in the Civil War, MacArthur is willing to do whatever is necessary to keep America as a united, great and free country."
USA_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 14, 1890, in Denison, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Dwight David 'Ike' Eisenhower, a fan of military history since a young age, applied for both West Point and Annapolis in 1910, being accepted in the former after the highest ranking candidate failed the physical requirement in 1911. He graduated in 1915 along with Omar Bradley and was almost discharged due to a leg injury, but West Point's chief medical officer interceded with the War Department and obtained a commission for him. Eisenhower would be posted with the 19th Infantry Regiment in the Mexican Border and reached the rank of Captain in 1917. He was transferred to Fort Benning in late 1918, where he remained training with the Camp Polk Tank school until the 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy. 'Ike' was promoted to Major in 1920. His interest in armored warfare only grew and grew, and quickly joined Patton's and Van Voorhis in their requests of increased funding for a mechanization program. In 1924, he was sent to Panama, where he served under General Fox Conner, who decided to tutor 'Ike' into philosophy, military history and military theory and was selected in 1925 for the Command and General Staff College, graduating first in a class of 245 officers. Conner would help 'Ike' to get into the War College, becoming one of the youngest students of the academy and receiving the praise of General Pershing himself. After his graduation, he was assigned to the Army War College, and then served as executive officer to Major General George Van Horn Moseley, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to 1933. Since then he has served as chief military aide of General Douglas MacArthur, accompanying him to the Philippines, where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government. Since then, he has become MacArthur's undisputed second in command, and while their personalities tend to clash often, many claim that their skills complement each other."
USA_OMAR_BRADLEY_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 12, 1893, in Clark, Missouri, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Omar Nelson 'Brad' Bradley signed up to join the United States Military Academy in 1911, where he finished second in the placements for the appointments. However, the winner couldn't accept the congressional appointment for the academy, so it was granted to Bradley. He graduated in 1915 and was commissioned as an infantry second lieutenant, and becoming a close friend of another graduate of the same class, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was assigned to the 14th Infantry Regiment stationed in the Mexican border, reaching the rank of Captain in 1917 and being transferred to guard the copper mines in Butte, Montana, remaining in garrison duties for the rest of the decade. From 1920 to 1924, he worked as a math teacher in West Point, reaching the rank of Major in 1924 and undergoing the advanced infantry course at Fort Benning. Bradley later studied at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, graduating in 1929 and serving as an instructor in tactics at the U.S. Army Infantry School, where he met and established good relations with Lt.Col. George Marshall. He taught in West Point from 1929 to 1934, where he took a break to study at the U.S. Army War College, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. With the fears that the War Plan Blue might be executed in the near future, Bradley was first promoted to Brigadier General and then to Field Marshal along with Eisenhower by MacArthur's own request.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Largely considered one of the most dependable generals of the US Army, Marshall once described him as 'A quiet, unassuming and capable man, with sound common sense. He has an absolute dependability. Give him a job and forget it' and that reputation may have helped to speed up his promotion."
USA_GEORGE_MARSHALL_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 21, 1880, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Catlett Marshall Jr. began his military career in the Virginia Military Institute in 1900, graduating in 1902 as a second lieutenant of the United States Army. Marshall was posted in the Philippines during the Philippine-American war, as well as helping to contain guerrilla operations in the area post-war. During the Weltkrieg, Marshall was sent to France, along with many other American officers as observers, where he was promoted to Captain for his observations. After working as aide-de-camp of General Pershing for a short time in 1919, he began being assigned to several positions in the army, mainly to relay his experience in the Weltkrieg to more inexperienced officers as well as helping the army modernize its doctrine. During this time, he became a key planner and writer in the War Department, commanded the 15th Regiment in the Legation Cities and taught the at the Army War College until 1927. Having being promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed as assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he appointed Edwin F. Harding in charge of the school's publication. He'd be posted on different Infantry regiments until being promoted to colonel in 1933 and was promoted to his current rank of Brigadier General in late 1935 due to fear of desertion of several important members of the officer corps in case of 'internal instability'. Regardless, he is widely considered one of the best planners of the United States Army and is widely respected within the General Staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a Democrat father and a Republican mother, Marshall has become a politically tolerant man, both publicly and privately."
USA_HENRY_H_ARNOLD_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 25, 1886, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Henry Harley "Hap" Arnold, a member of the distinguished American Arnold dynasty from which several politicians and military officers were part of, signed up for West Point when he had just turned 17. While he wanted to join the Cavalry corps, his grades and overall performance in the academy caused him to be assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, stationed at the Philippines. In April 1911, he requested a transfer to the Signal Corps, where he completed his instruction as an aviator on May. He'd continue his pioneering work in the air force throughout the late 1910s, and became fascinated by the aircraft developments in the Weltkrieg. During the Twenties, he joined up his colleague William Lendrum Mitchell to fight for an independent air force, which lead to Mitchell being court-martialed. Arnold stood, along with other renowned airmen, in defence of Mitchell but failed to win the trial. Arnold would continue to fight for an independent air force, trying to sway congressmen and recruit pilots to his cause, until he was sent to Fort Riley for 'attempting to influence legislation in an improper manner', where he spent the next few years writing books trying to interest young people in the air force. He'd return in 1928 to enter the Army's Command and General Staff School, from where he graduated in 1929. He'd continue changing posts in the American army until 1935, where he was assigned with the General Headquarters Air Force, the closest thing to an independent Air Force he had been in all his career, being promoted to Brigadier General in March 2, 1935. With his requests of an independent air force largely refused, Arnold may harbour some resentment against the general staff..."
USA_CLARENCE_HUEBNER_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 24, 1888, in Bushton, Kansas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Clarence Ralph Huebner was born into a poor farming family, and so he was unable to afford joining the military academy outright. Instead, he enlisted as a private for the Army, serving in the 18th Infantry Regiment for nearly seven years and reaching the rank of Sergeant by 1916.

After returning to the US, he was assigned to the Artillery Batteries near the Mexican Border, where he was promoted to Major and assigned to the Inspector General's office in Washington D.C.. He remained in his post for the next few years, where his ability in French allowed him to translate many of the French reports on the battles of the Weltkrieg, earning him a promotion to Colonel in 1918 and later Brigadier General in 1920, and allowing him to meet the up-and-coming George C. Marshall in the War Department. He was then transferred to Fort Meade, where he was introduced to George S. Patton, quickly becoming friends and through which he was introduced to Eisenhower, both of which quickly became friends and seeming pupils of Conner. This would lead him to choose Eisenhower to follow him to Panama after being assigned to its garrison, and despite their disagreements on motorized divisions and the usage of tanks in modern war. He was promoted to Major General in 1925 and was proposed by Pershing for Chief of Staff in 1930, although he was ultimately passed on in favour of Douglas MacArthur. He has since then being assigned to the First Army, and he is known to maintain regular correspondence with Marshall, Patton and Eisenhower still.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Soon to retire from the Army."

USA_expand_national_guard: "Expand the National Guard"

USA_incentivize_charity: "Incentivize Charity"
USA_incentivize_charity_desc: "Currently there is a large swath of the population that needs our aid but, as usual, direct government intervention would be inefficient compared to private intervention.

USA_liberal_unions: "Support Liberal Unions"

For too long, politicians have been at the whim of their donors in the oil and steel industries, while simultaneously ignoring their loyal supporters. This will no longer be the case. Legislation banning all forms of dark money in politics will be passed while the amount of legal money that should be allowed in donations is still being debated."
USA_national_electricity: "National Electricity"
USA_national_electricity_desc: "The American people need affordable electricity and they need it now. The government will take control of waterpower direclty through buyouts and purchase majority shares in US electricity companies to organize cheap electricity for the public good to power America's railroads, streets and homes."
USA_power_of_the_ballot: "Power of the Ballot"
USA_power_of_the_ballot_desc: "We can no longer allow for the American people to be left out of decisions concerning a government that affects them all. National initiatives and referendums should be expanded as a means to settle public debates as opposed to relying exclusively on bureaucrats and the ability to recall public officials seen as a moral right."
USA_wealth_taxation: "Wealth Taxation"
USA_wealth_taxation_desc: "We cannot allow America to become a new aristocracy that eliminates divine right of monarchy but replaces it with wealth. Our new inheritance and land taxes will ensure that the wealthy do their patriotic duty and pay the appropriate amount of taxes to fund goods for the American people, especially its farmers and workers."
USA_new_public_works: "Public Works"
USA_new_public_works_desc: "We need to knock out two for the price of one and combat both the unemployment and under-development that poses a national security risk. The Public Works Administration will hire a large swath of people to build massive public projects such as dams, bridges, and highways. It may be expensive, but the hope it offers America is priceless."
USA_encourage_temperance: "Encourage Temperance"
USA_encourage_temperance_desc: "Overconsumption of liquor is little more than a gateway to poverty, madness, and sloth, and it remains one of the great social ills of our times. While the anti-Saloon League failed to nationally prohobit it, we can expand funding for dry county enforcement, build temperance fountains and scare the public straight with a campaign against liquor."
USA_citizen_education: "Citizen Education"
USA_citizen_education_desc: "All across the nation, Native American citizens are not receiving a proper, hands on education. Our Education system should implement some of John Dewey's reforms alongside a nationalistic program that promotes American values and loyalty."
USA_national_railroads: "National Railroads"
USA_national_railroads_desc: "Our country is sadly lacking in providing a public means of national production while the Railroad Brotherhood desires greater protection from their bosses. The solution to this comes naturally via the nationalisation of railroads, purchased with money raised by bonds via the genius of Glenn E. Plumb."
USA_credit_unions: "Support Credit Unions"
USA_credit_unions_desc: "It is time to shake off the influence banks have over the lives of workers, farmers and the free-laborer. Credit unions will be issued cheap federal loans to get their start and tax breaks so that the independent contractors may be more self-reliant and the bankers held accountable."
USA_national_health_insurance: "National Health Insurance"
USA_national_health_insurance_desc: "When our citizens fall ill they are expected to pay for the right to live. This is immoral but worse, it drives the people in the arms of the faux-caring Marxists. A public healthcare option will provide universal health care, funded by an increase in the income tax, so that all may enjoy their natural right to life."
USA_fair_house_trade: "Fair House Standard Trade"
USA_fair_house_trade_desc: "While trade has its place, especially for our farmers whom must export their goods, our workers can not be expected to compete with every nation on earth. It also undermines our cause to accept cheap goods from nations that do not accept similar working conditions. Goods that will lower the wages of our workers will pay a higher tariff."
USA_protect_strikers: "Protect Strikers"
USA_protect_strikers_desc: "Strikers are little more than workers asserting their rights in the face of abysmal working conditions and yet governors, bosses, and judges believe they have the right to make Marxists look vindicated by cracking down on these patriotic Americans. Striking will be recognized as a national right and the army will protect those whom are attacked by industrial goons."
USA_quota_act: "Quota Act"
USA_quota_act_desc: "With all the pressure already laid on American culture and worker wages that last thing we need is large amounts of untrained, cheap laborers pouring over the border. The quota system will put a limit on the number of low-wage immigrants that can come into the nation annually."
USA_food_stamps: "Food Stamps"
USA_food_stamps_desc: "Henry Wallace had a revelation when he saw surpluses of agricultural goods on one hill and starving citizens on another. If the market won't achieve equilibrium on its own, we will give it the encouragement it needs with a food stamp program that will make it easier for poor citizens to afford farm goods."
USA_farm_credit_act: "Farm Bankruptcy Act"
USA_farm_credit_act_desc: "The madness of allowing our farms to close, especially in a time of depression, is utterly intolerable! A co-operative Farm Credit System will be created to provide farmers cheap loans and to prevent the avoidable foreclosure of the nations providers, for their welfare and our own."
USA_support_long: "Rescue the Kingfish"
USA_support_long_desc: "Is Huey Long a man without issue? Of course not; he runs a political machine and has a head the size of Mount Rushmore. However, he is an ally of the progressives in his region and his territory is a stalwart against the authoritarians while his economic policies promise to help break radicalism. We shall do for him what he is attempting to do for America and save him from the loons and cowards whom surround him."

### National People's Party ###
USA_return_to_true_americanism: "A Return to True Americanism"
USA_return_to_true_americanism_desc: "The National People’s Party have won the 1940 election! Their agenda is a hybrid of Dixiecrat, Fordist and Nativist ideology, reflecting the big-tent nature of the party. They call for a return to small government, the dismantlement of the welfare state built by Norris and the formulation of a national policy to \"maintain America’s White Anglo-Saxon Protestant character\" at all costs."
USA_end_federal_largesse: "End Federal Largesse"
USA_end_federal_largesse_desc: "While the Progressives may claim that the system they created will lead a \"just and square America for all to enjoy\", we know better. What they have created is nothing more than a system of near Gracchian largesse, which will do nothing other than to make all Americans the clients of the Progressives and their friends in Washington. To ensure that all citizens continue to remain free men rather than slaves, we must therefore dismantle the so-called \"Fair Deal\" established by Norris. To wean the people off the poisoned chalice they have been offered will be difficult, but its rewards will be all the sweeter in the end."
USA_corporatism_not_councilism: "Corporatism Not Councilism"
USA_corporatism_not_councilism_desc: "Having dispensed with the inefficient and immoral dole instituted by Norris, we must now return to the traditions of hard work and free enterprise that made America great in the first place. With this in mind, we will begin by removing the unnecessary regulations and oversights imposed on the market, which threatened to strangle business in its entirety. In America, business fulfill its social function through the positive relationship of the capitalist and his worker, not through the demands of the bureaucrat and the union boss. \n\nWe will remind all of this fact by putting the emphasis on Fordism rather than Crypto-Syndicalist political oversight as the recipe for our social model, and let the private sector stand free once again."
USA_unchain_capitalism: "Unchain Capitalism"
USA_unchain_capitalism_desc: "While we have made great strides in combating the sprawling red-tape laid by the Progressives and restoring the spirit of free enterprise to America, there is still more that can be done. We will build on our unique social model by enshrining the role of the corporation as the locomotive which drives America towards an ever brighter future. And this great machine will now have the chains holding it in place broken."
USA_restore_agrarian_autonomy: "Restore Agrarian Autonomy"
USA_restore_agrarian_autonomy_desc: "The promises made by the Progressives to farmers across America were some of their most pernicious lies. They claimed that they would bring about a new era of stability and prosperity, bringing about Jefferson’s agrarian idyll. In actuality, the government programs targeting farmers have made them less independent and more beholden to the rich and powerful than ever. \n\nTheir dependence on government assistance to escape the horrors of the depression have tied to aid programs which are now held above their heads to justify lowering prices, growing certain varieties of crops and more. It is our imperative duty to break apart these arrangements and return power and control to the farmers, lest farming become the sole prerogative of the state. They may complain now, but they will thank us later."
USA_enshrine_states_rights: "Enshrine States' Rights"
USA_enshrine_states_rights_desc: "Given their long history as enemies of states’ rights and advocates for further increases to federal power, it should be no surprise that the Progressives continued this policy during the last four years. The Norris presidency marked the apogee of this tendency, as federal power was used as a battering ram ahead of the implementation of their un-American agenda. Now that we have taken power, we will pursue a policy of restoring autonomy to the states, and re-assuring regions like the South of our commitment to letting them once again govern themselves."
USA_whittle_down_washington: "Whittle Down Washington"
USA_whittle_down_washington_desc: "While we have now rolled back the bureaucratic despotism of the Progressive Party and re-asserted America’s traditions small government, capitalism and an independent spirit, this is not enough. We must ensure that we will enshrine these values within the law, to ensure that they will never be challenged again. Only then can the overreach of federal power be forever checked and our traditions preserved."
USA_defend_fair_columbia: "Defend Fair Columbia"
USA_defend_fair_columbia_desc: "Like our predecessor, Rome, our city on the hill is all too often threatened by the incursions of barbarian and alien elements who threaten the safety of the republic. To prevent America from being overrun, we will redouble the patriotic effort to ensure that the native population of this land and their heritage will remain sacrosanct. Liberty cannot and will not be allowed to be drowned underneath the growing tide of foreign influence that now seems to beat upon it."
USA_enforce_asiatic_exclusion: "Enforce Asiatic Exclusion"
USA_enforce_asiatic_exclusion_desc: "It is well understand throughout America that the integration of Asiatic nationals is and will remain impossible. Consequently, our policy has been to ensure that this issue does not occur to begin with, by enforcing a policy of Asian Exclusion, to prevent our shores from being overrun. Nevertheless, there are still places where this policy is insufficient, most prominently in the loopholes used by the Filipinos and Japanese to continue to enter this country. \n\nResolving the first shall be easy, if unpopular with their government, but the second requires more thought..."
USA_expel_foreign_anarchists: "Expel Foreign Anarchists"
USA_expel_foreign_anarchists_desc: "For many years, the underbelly of Europe has vomited onto the East Coast some of the vilest, filthiest and most diseased wretches known to man. Bomb-chuckers, rail wreckers and arsonists, all declaring loyalty to Anarchist and Socialist causes have done immeasurable damage to our nation. No amount of raids, prison sentences and executions can dissuade them, with some even being emboldened by the action taken against them. The only course of action left to us, is to compile records of all these dangerous subversives in our nation, together with any accomplices and associates, and expel them from our nation without delay. \n\nIf they love Socialism, let them find it in their own homelands and not here."
USA_promulgate_national_racial_laws: "Promulgate National Racial Laws"
USA_promulgate_national_racial_laws_desc: "The American people were amongst the first in the world to understand the importance of enshrining the natural racial order in law. Our laws and traditions have ensured the stability of the nation and the best development of all in it according to their traits and capabilities. Nevertheless, in this age of upheaval and radical agitation, the extant legislation is increasingly unable to respond to the needs of the day and serve the national interest. \n\nTo address this issue, we will organize the \"National Conference on Racial Order and Hygiene\", to formulate a more modern approach to racial policy, which will hopefully serve us long into the future."
USA_drive_out_seditious_elements: "Drive Out Seditious Elements"
USA_drive_out_seditious_elements_desc: "Within America, there are a number of political agitators of foreign extraction who have proven themselves increasingly troublesome. While we had hoped that our recent initiatives in reinforcing the social order would dissuade them, this has not been the case. If anything, they now roundly attack our defense of the natural order and agitate minorities within our nation in support of foreign powers. This troublesome behavior can clearly only be met with a more permanent solution. \n\nConsequently, we will begin to send these agitators and their followers to the shores of those states to whom they profess loyalty. If they wish to co-habit with the enemy, then we will help them be on their way."
USA_break_syndicalist_agitation: "Break Syndicalist Agitation"
USA_break_syndicalist_agitation_desc: "Having defended America from a myriad of threats, without and within, we now find ourselves facing the great danger of all, the Syndicalist agitator. While our actions may have severed its colored and foreign appendages, Syndicalist tendencies have unfortunately dug themselves into the minds of the American workingman like a tick. We will undertake a campaign to remove these dangerous ideologies from the minds of the general public, and cauterize the wounds they have left by reaffirming traditional American values in their place."
USA_liberty_not_legalism: "Liberty Not Legalism"
USA_liberty_not_legalism_desc: "America is not called \"the land of the free\" without reason. In this country, our traditions have always favored liberty, personal agency and the ability of the individual to act without being encumbered by excessive restrictions and red-tape. Under this policy, our nation flourished, and citizens were able to experience the boundless potential and prosperity of the American dream. \n\nWhile the job of rolling back the Progressive excesses which endangered this dream is now complete, our work is not yet done. We must now expand on this promise by codifying legislation that allows for our Capitalist model to work to its fullest, to bring about the fruits of the American Gospel more than ever."
USA_privatized_progress: "Privatized Progress"
USA_privatized_progress_desc: "Not all infrastructural development needs to be undertaken by the government. Private enterprise can frequently fulfill the same role at a lower price and with better quality to boot. Why then should we waste tax-payer money on boondoggles and roads to nowhere when private citizens will fulfill genuine needs as and when they appear, and with better results."
USA_localized_development: "Localized Development"
USA_localized_development_desc: "For too long, infrastructural development in this country has been focused on nation-wide projects of massive scope and cost. While schemes of this sort are essential to uniting a country as large as our own, they can also lead to us missing the forest for the trees. We must also take care that we maintain and build up the local roads, bridges and all manner of other infrastructure that the majority of Americans depend on. The role of the government should be to build what the little man can’t, rather than building to lofty heights most will never need to reach."
USA_power_to_the_pinkertons: "Power to the Pinkertons"
USA_power_to_the_pinkertons_desc: "The name \"Pinkerton\" has long been one feared by outlaws and agitators alike. Whether it be on the vast expanse of the Old West, among the slums of New York or in the factories of Chicago, the Pinkerton Agency has long been a force for order and a hammer against criminality. Even the Department of Justice has been known to call on these brave men when conventional law enforcement can no longer cope with the circumstances at hand. \n\nIn recognition of these facts, and in view of the circumstances we now face, we will once again call on the Pinkertons for help. Their use will be invaluable in crushing the most recalcitrant of socialist agitators and other criminals who wish to destabilize our way of life and the capitalist system."
USA_parochial_policing: "Parochial Policing"
USA_parochial_policing_desc: "The institution of the Sherriff is one of America’s noblest and best offices. Answerable to only the citizens and the constitutions of state and nation, they are as democratic as American law enforcement can be. As a result, the institutions Sheriff stands and acts on behalf of the interests of the ordinary citizenship, and symbolizes all that is good about law and order in our nation. Why then should we attempt to do with it in favor of federal agencies with diktats from Washington? \n\nInstead, we will continue to defer to the Sheriff’s departments in everyday law enforcement, and further cooperate with them in our national anti-criminal effort, rather than attempting to supplant them."
USA_protestant_prosperous_pure: "Protestant, Prosperous, Pure"
USA_protestant_prosperous_pure_desc: "Through our vigorous efforts, we have restored to the nation its fundamental and best characteristics. Its Protestant morality and sensibilities have been enshrined. The prosperity brought about by our Capitalist system has not only been safeguarded, but brought to greater heights than ever before. And the purity of culture and blood in our nation has been defended against the potential dangers of alien intrusion. Never has there been a time when our shining city on the hill has drawn closer to the dream which our Founders had for it, than now. n\nGod bless America!"
USA_pelleynomics: "Spiritual Social Policy"
USA_pelleynomics_desc: "William Dudley Pelley's Galahad College provides instruction a wide variety of topics, including Christian economics, esotericism and Pelley’s Liberation Doctrine, which has since grown into Soulcraft. With the NPP now in power, he has approached us with a vision for \"the Galahad Fellowship\" to be formed and sister schools to the original college to be opened nationwide. This is a perfect opportunity to inculcate in the youth a vision of society in line with our party's own ideology."
USA_lolberts_paradise: "The New Gilded Age"
USA_lolberts_paradise_desc: "The Gilded Age represented a peak in the industrialization and enrichment of America. And for all the complaints of Socialist agents, it must be remembered that these developments occured amidst a period of limited government intervention and generally freedom of business pratice. With this in mind, we will make laissez-faire capitalism the stated pratice and value of our administration and America going forward, so that we may witness a new Gilded Age."
USA_remember_americas_indians: "Aid the Aborigines"
USA_remember_americas_indians_desc: "Many Native American tribes are as tired of the former establishment's policies towards them as we are, with many still suffering under the penalties imposed on them for siding with the Confederacy in the American Civil War. We will close ranks with those tribes whom are most willing to support our government and its policies and in return grant them higher autonomy, especially in Oklahoma."
USA_honor_the_pioneers: "Honor the Pioneers"
USA_honor_the_pioneers_desc: "It was the pioneering spirit of the Americans who came before us that allowed this great nation to stretch from sea to shining sea. And it is this spirit that we will once again appeal to for the further development of the nation. We will once again appeal to the brave and enterprising to go forth and seek their fortune wherever the opportunity shows itself, knowing that the rewards will be great."
USA_the_spirit_of_protestant_europe: "Appeal for Protestant Unity"
USA_the_spirit_of_protestant_europe_desc: "America's illustrious history has always seen it a haven for the Protestant and Nordic peoples of Europe, whose spirit and valor was crucial to the building of our nation. Therefore, we will undertake a national campaign to once again unite all Americans of such stock, for the purpose of revitalizing those political and cultural traditions which first made us great."
USA_anglo_saxon_excellence: "Maintain Anglo-Saxon Excellence"
USA_anglo_saxon_excellence_desc: "The founding stock of this nation were the free-spirited Anglo-Saxons. And it was ther pursuit of liberty and drive for prosperity alone that allowed America to flourish. Keeping this in mind, we will make it our policy to promote all that which is Anglo-Saxon, so that the exultation of its spirit may rejuvinate our nation."

USA_by_the_people_for_the_people_desc: "The Populist Party have won the 1940 election! After years of struggle and campaigning to win over the American populace, [USA.GetLeader] has lead the forces of the Populist's Party to electoral victory, smashing the establishment parties in the process. While the road ahead is long and filled with challenges, that for the future. For now, we rejoice, as the American people will at long last have a true voice in Washington!"

USA_against_all_tyrants_desc: "Unlike the cowardly establishment who profited from collaboration with the forces of tyranny, be they the vile ODP, the bankers of Wall Street, the Military-Industrial Complex or the Imperialists of Europe, we have remained uncorrupted. We take a stand for the people against all forms of Tyranny, and they must be reminded of this fact. \n\nNot only will the emphasizing of this distinction allow us to affirm our base of support, it will allow us to justify a crackdown on our vile opponents. After all, those who are against us stand against the people, and the people will never again allow Tyranny to take hold in America..."
USA_fight_masters_of_finance: "Fight the Masters of Finance"
USA_fight_masters_of_finance_desc: "As we prepare to implement our program of extensive reforms, be they economic or social, of key importance to their genuine implementation is the securing of sufficient funding. While we can implement all the reforms and protections we want, if we want them to be of genuine use, we need the money to make it. What better place to look then towards the Ultra-Rich, the top 1% of the 1%? Using a system of radical taxation along with... other methods, we can begin to tap into the wealth of the most well off, for the betterment of all."
USA_combat_capitalism: "Combat Capitalism"
USA_combat_capitalism_desc: "One issue that has always been on the Populist Party's agenda has been the dismantling of the oppressive Capitalist System. Since coming into power, we have seemingly lacked sufficient reason to go after key figures within that system. \n\nThat was until today, as President [USA.GetLeader] has announced that evidence has been uncovered linking former President Garner, General Douglass MacArthur, Henry Ford and a litany of other names in a plot to ensure that the United States fell into civil war, to establish the permanent dictatorship of Capital over America. With this justification, lawsuits, crackdowns and other such actions are beginning to be implemented, and the forces of Capital are at last feeling what was long due."
USA_oppose_fordism: "Oppose Fordism"
USA_oppose_fordism_desc: "Although greatly affected by the crackdown on Garner and the Business Plotters, Henry Ford and his Industrialist friends and allies have still been able to escape the bulk of popular justice. In order to solve this issue and to strike against one of the most egregious specimens of a Capitalist Roadster, a series of bills have proposed in Congress, aimed at curtailing the powers of the Robber Barons. While quite broad in scope, Ford Motor Company has been made a main target of the legislation, to make an example of one of the most pernicious companies the world has ever seen."
USA_renewed_trust_busting: "Renewed Trust Busting"
USA_renewed_trust_busting_desc: "Large trusts were and are a major source of consternation in this country. Their pernicious exploitation of the working man and undue influence on the governing system are to blame for many social ills, and sowed the ground for the Depression. To prevent these injustices from occurring again, our administration will act to break up the largest banks and other industrial conglomerates."
USA_the_wealth_ceiling: "The Wealth Ceiling"
USA_the_wealth_ceiling_desc: "Robber Barons have plundered this nation for too long, taking its vast resources and misusing them when they could help the nation. Recognizing this dire state of affair we have decided to implement a new wealth cap. This will allow for a fairer distribution of wealth, and it may even help our small businesses thrive, as their corporate competitors once again face real pressure. The wealthy may denounce us, but we know the people will support us."

USA_end_crash_making_desc: "For too long, the bankers and other assorted scoundrels of the financial sector have engaged in the intentional destabilization of economic life to drive up their profits.

USA_share_our_wealth_desc: "The time has come the rich that helped plunge America into depression and disaster to make amends. Going forward, no person will be allowed to accumulate more than 300 times the annual national income. Incomes will be capped at $1 million, and inheritances capped at $5.1 million.

USA_peace_and_justice_for_all_desc: "The promise of America is the promise of fair treatment and fair laws in accordance with the best features of Democracy. In practice, the reality is much less promising, with a general disenfranchisement of the Colored races, corrupt elites treating many rural regions as fiefs and blatant corruption and violence at the polls. For America to fulfill its true destiny as a nation by and for the people, these blights on our system must be excised. And we know just how to do it."
USA_displace_dixiecrats: "Displace the Dixiecrats"
USA_displace_dixiecrats_desc: "The Dixiecrats were always Long and the AFP’s most severe rival, threatening much of the party base through crude racial appeals and electoral fraud. While the Dixiecrats do not represent nearly as existential a threat for the PP, they are still a serious problem to our ambitions in the South. For this reason, we will undertake a campaign to weaken Dixiecrat strongholds and institutions and insert our own men into them. While the Dixiecrat machine may have been used to reprehensible ends before, that does not mean we should destroy. Instead, we should repurpose it to further the popular interest."
USA_end_southern_chauvinism: "End Southern Chauvinism"
USA_end_southern_chauvinism_desc: "The Dixiecrats and their more radical allies have long represented reaction and repression in its most unadulterated form. Their tyranny and near-enslavement of the Negro so long after the Civil War is a black stain on our country. Add to this a history as a bulwark of reactionary and corrupt elites on the national stage, and you have the greatest threat to the common man in America. The only solution is to leverage the full power of the state apparatus against these forces, to utterly dismantle and level their political power. Southern Chauvinism must be ruthlessly and completely exterminated!"
USA_enforce_the_fifteenth: "Enforce the Fifteenth"
USA_enforce_the_fifteenth_desc: "Passed after the Civil War, the Fifteenth Amendment was meant to guarantee the American Negro the right to vote. In practice a number of legal barriers -notably the various Grandfather Clauses- have been erected to ensure that they are still locked out of public life. Now that Dixiecrat power has been broken, we can begin pushing the courts towards a more rigorous and broad enforcement of the amendment, dismantle this system. And if the Negroes should vote for us in return, who can blame them?"
USA_ensure_election_fairness: "Ensure Election Fairness"
USA_ensure_election_fairness_desc: "Given the corruption, violence and outright incompetence displayed at the local level throughout America, it would be unreasonable to claim that the current electoral process is truly fair. While private citizens and public figures have attempted to act in the defense of the popular will, they have all too often been overcome by malicious forces. The only solution is therefore to establish a national organ for monitor elections fairly and universally. To this end, we will work towards the establishment of a national board of electoral supervisors, appointed by Congress, to safeguard our democratic process."
USA_the_national_machine: "The National Machine"
USA_the_national_machine_desc: "Now that we have established our party’s nature and begun implementing our popular reforms, the time has come to further consolidate our position. With the old Dixiecrat establishment out of the way, and the old AFP apparatus reconstituted, the South and Mid-West have never been more firmly under our control. Having united with the labor movement in the North, we can also establish ourselves in what was previously the region most hostile to us. The time has come to unite the disparate branches and leaders of the Populist Party and form an unbeatable National Machine!"
USA_riding_to_victory: "Riding to Victory"
USA_riding_to_victory_desc: "One of the major issues faced by Colored voters in this country is their inability to make it to the polls in the first place. While our efforts to dismantle the most obvious racial chauvinism and open intimidation practiced in the South may have borne fruit, this behavior has not been wholly eradicated. Contested areas still bear witness to political meddling, alongside other less obvious obstacles. Finding transport to the polls is an especially difficult endeavor, especially in rural areas, where infrastructure and transport is rudimentary. \n\nIn the spirit of democratic equality, we will organize an effort to safely bring these voters to the polls, so that they can make their voices heard."
USA_the_peoples_court: "The People's Court"
USA_the_peoples_court_desc: "The Supreme Court was intended to act as a neutral and apolitical force, ensuring that the law was written and enforced in line with the spirit of the Constitution. In practice, the court has been utterly captured by the entrenched establishment and acts contrary to its role. It has become nothing but a rubber stamp for the establishment, and an obstacle to reform. If we are to achieve our political program, drastic action must be taken to change the court’s behavior."

Consequently, it should be no surprise that the Constitution which they drafted was an exceptional document for the ages. While we may amend the Constitution to adapt to the ages, we should never think that we can do better by abandoning it.

While its original goal was to allow for a balance of political power between states of varying sizes and populations, the system has gradually broken down in the last century. The development of infrastructure and urbanization has made the country easier to travel and more disparate in population. \n\nAt the same time, the development of political machines has led to partisan capture of many state legislatures, allowing small entrenched elites to vote contrary to popular will. And while the allocation of electors may mitigate the effects, they cannot fundamentally solve the issue. To truly resolve it, the only solution may be the outright abolition of the college."
USA_the_second_constitutional_convention: "The Second Constitutional Convention"
USA_the_second_constitutional_convention_desc: "In rising against the British and fighting for a more free and representative America, the founders showed their essentially populist and egalitarian character. Nevertheless, theirs was a fundamentally Bourgeoise revolution, motivated primarily by issues of taxation and particularly beneficial to that class. More clearly reprehensible was their treatment of the Negroes, who would be held in bondage for almost a century more, and whose conditions remain deplorable. \n\nAs such, the time has now come for parting way with the legacy of the Founders. We will convene a new Constitutional Convention, and draft a new guiding document truly capable of forwarding the rights and interests of proletarian America."
