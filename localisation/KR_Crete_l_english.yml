### Ideas ###
CRE_med_base:0 "German Mediterranean Base"
CRE_med_base_desc:0 "The island of Crete, especially with its naval base on the south coast, is one of the Kaiser's beloved Mediterranean naval outposts. First earned during the fallout of the Great War as Greece was forced to lease Crete's naval bases to Germany while the island itself was placed under the control of an autonomous civilian government that favors neither Athens or Berlin, Crete is of vital importance to the German Empire's naval maneuvers and operations in the region, especially in regards to safeguarding the Kaiser's beloved new possession in Suez."
CRE_local_tensions:0 "The 'Free' State"
CRE_local_tensions_desc:0 "While on paper, Crete is an independent international mandate, in actuality it is a German-Dominated pseudo colony with a puppet civilian government which only serves to rubber stamp the Kaiserliche Marine’s agenda. While technically an independent body, the civilian government serves as little more than a pawn of the garrison, who use their air of legitimacy to keep the locals in check and to ensure the naval base runs without issue. The native Cretans know this, and many are unhappy at this state of affairs. Unless something happened that shook the garrison from its perch, German soft control over Crete is here to stay."
CRE_disliked_garrison:0 "Incompetent Garrison Force"
CRE_disliked_garrison_desc:0 "The natural beauty and splendor of Crete has led to it becoming a popular destination for German Soldiers to relax and unwind. Outside of the rebel-infested jungles of Ostasien or the hectic savannas of Mittelafrika, the gentle political and natural climate however has allowed the German Soldiers posted to the island to relax and unwind. This arrangement however has left actual military matters sorely neglected, as actual threats to the island are often ignored due to the carefree attitude of our soldiers. Many have remarked that soldiers posted to Crete are more interested in drinking, partying and bedding local women than actually doing their jobs."

Thus far the situation in the island has been relatively stable, with partisans organizing under the surface and a civilian government managing the affairs of the state. Whether 1936 will prove to be the year that will see it all undone remains to be seen. "
CRE_survey_garrison:0 "Survey the Garrison"

With our coffers empty cuts must be made, and on the top of the docket is the large drain on German finances that is the Cretan Administration.

While there has previously been an understanding that this agreement would be temporary, in practice the German Empire has treated the base as a permanent acquisition. The time has come to end any pretense, the Cretan Generalregierung is here to stay and with it the German Base."

CRE_unity_govt:0 "Form a Unity Government"

Split between the dominant Kaiser loyalists headed by Kurt Student who seek to work with the locals and a self-serving minority who secretly swear their fealty to Goering and his goons in Mittelafrika while seeking to Germanize the entire island led by Alex Andrae and Richard Heidrich, these ambitious airmen shall battle for supremacy over one another behind the scenes as they work together to turn Crete into one giant airstrip fit for future German ambitions."

These shadows, dressed in black and armed with weapons, move from the monastery of Agios Charalambos and advance towards the old fort, Frangokastello. Led by Hatzimichalis Dalianis, these ghosts have been rather consistent for both our German and Turkish Occupiers.

CRE_inspect_garrison_desc:0 "The German Garrison has a reputation as a drunken band of incompetent hooligans more interested in bedding local women than actually doing their jobs. The fatal weakness of the Garrison was revealed in the kidnapping attempt on Governor Müller, as our inexperienced garrison failed to fight off a band of disorganized partisans and schoolchildren. We must reorganize our fighting force in Crete to account for any threats to German Rule that may present themselves."

Fruit, remaining a profitable industry through thick and thin, is a smart investment for our agricultural board.

crete.0.t:0 "The State of Crete in 1936"
crete.0.d:0 "Our beautiful island finds itself between a rock and a hard place, to put it lightly, for since our ‘independence’ that was oh so graciously granted to us by the Germans following their victory over Greece and her allies in Great War, much to the chagrin of their Ottoman allies that still claim our isle as their own, we have been caught in crossfires of international ambitions and the desires of super powers. Crete stands not as a truly independent state, but as a pseudo-colony of the Kaiserreich thanks to egregious post-war treaties that leased out our key naval infrastructure and dockyards, centered around the massive Port of Heraklion, to the Germans and placed our Crete under a semi-autonomous civilian government forcibly kept separate and isolated from the Greek government on the mainland. \n\nAlthough the civilian government led by Alexandros Zaimis has long tried to resist German influence over these long and difficult years, the island has become increasingly dominated by the foreign military stationed on our island under the command of Admiral Georg Alexander von Müller, split between two competing forces within local branches of the Kaiserliche Marine and the Deutsche Luftstreitkräfte, and each with their own bickering internal factions as well like the domineering Fallschirmjägers themselves torn between loyalty to Berlin or Goering’s machinations in Mittelafrika, revealing a fractured hierarchy that only grows more unstable the longer German rule holds on. However, things are far from better within the civilian government as arguments break out over Crete’s destiny as many wish to reunite with Greece or even the Turks as egged on by Mustafa Ertuğrul Aker, while rumors of foreign spies, meddling poets, and radicalized student organizations of both the Right and the Left gearing up for armed resistance against our occupiers worryingly abound as well. Overall, our island stands on the precipice of destiny, and like the Cretan State of 1898 before us, our island once again has a shot at true independence if we can just seize it, or shall we be resigned to march dutifully under crosses and crescents from foreign lands forevermore..."

crete.1.d:0 "Partisans, long dissatisfied with German Rule over the Island of Crete have finally made their move today, kidnapping longtime Governor of the Island Georg Alexander von Müller. Müller's car was ambushed while en route from his residence to his divisional headquarters. Müller was tied and forced into the back seat while two partisans impersonated him and his driver respectively. Müller's notorious impatience at roadblocks enabled the car to pass numerous checkpoints before being abandoned at the hamlet of Heliana. As of now the fate of Crete seems to be up in the air, as questions abound in the absence of our Governor."

Müller's captors have made an unsuccessful attempt to flee to Egypt, yet have been stopped by a German Blockade.

While typically ignored in the sphere of operations in the wider Empire, Crete has become a center of Paratrooper training and operations, with much of the German Brass experienced in the area moving to Crete.

In response to this, some have suggested his older brother George for the throne.

crete.14.t:0 "A Foreign Backer?"
crete.14.d:0 "Our island exists in a fragile state of peace; however few believe that we can truly remain at peace unless we can manage to find a major power to protect Crete. While it has been agreed that we must find a backer to guarantee our independence, the question of who that backer will be is much more contentious. Some favor the Germans, despite our checkered history with the Kaiser. Others suggest the Entente, others have put forward the Cairo Pact. Some more outrageous people have even suggested groveling to our old foe, the Ottomans, for protection."

After moving back in to the Néa Anáktora, [CRE.GetLeader] delivered an address to the wounded nation, thanking them for their resolve and promising a brighter path forwards."

crete_sale.1.d:0 "With our economy in shambles after Black Monday, our Colonial Empire has been under fairly harsh scrutiny. The main territory that has been under examination is Crete. Crete is larger and harder to defend than Malta, and the upkeep is higher as well.

crete_sale.9.d:0 "With the transaction finalised with the Germans, the status of the Cretan state has come to the forefront of our agenda. As Crete was ours before we lost the Weltkrieg, the majority of the ministers are pushing to annex the Cretan state. However, a few men are calling for only an indirect subordination of Crete. What shall we do?"
crete_sale.9.a:0 "Install a new Cretan government."
