## Vera Cruz  ##
POLITICS_LACERDA_TOT_RJM_DESC:0 "Carlos Frederico Werneck de Lacerda was born in 1914, the year the weltkrieg started, and his very name is significant to understand him; Carlos comes from Karl Marx, Frederico from Friedrich Engels, as his father was a socialist activist as well who greatly admired the duo; In time, he followed in his father's footsteps, and joined the CGT and became a full time leftist activist as early as 1932, when he put his law degree on the backseat to focus on the political realm entirely. Long involved in the Demoratic Left and before that the CGT, he found himself rapidly rising in the ranks of brazilian syndicalist circles, thanks to his no nonsense attitude and oratory talent; albeit some claim this is due to his father's influence, not his own talent. His faith in syndicalism is unabated by the crises that followed the past decade on the world, and he took an active part on bringing it to his home. Now, has taken up the great responsibility of leading his new nation, and to finish the fight against the capitalist rot of former Brazil for good, and seeks to implement extensive reforms on almost all matters of state. However, his somewhat aggressive demeanour may result in issues both domestically and abroad when it comes to close negotiations."
POLITICS_MINERVINO_OLIVER_RJM_DESC:0 "Like many of Brazil's poor, Minervino de Oliveira began to work as a child, and from his earliest years of adulthood he already was an influential union member, and also was an early member of the Brazilian Syndicalist Party and contributed to leftist newspapers. By the time the New Republic arose, he was a natural candidate to enter the political arena, and he entered Rio's city council in 1928. In the next decade, his staunch defense of workers rights and support of strikes garnered him many admirers and even more enemies. In 1936, his support to the Democratic Left front of João Mangabeira was a key point in the ideologically charged and contentious race. Thrusted into his new position by the liberation of his land, Mangabeira is the first of hopefully many leaders of this relatively young nation, and hopes to create a legacy of equality and prosperity that will contrast with the terrible legacy left behind by Brazil and its political cronies."
POLITICS_CARLOS_LUZ_RJM_DESC:0 "Carlos Coimbra da Luz was born in 1894 in a small town in the state of Minas Gerais, but later moved to the capital of Belo Horizonte to study, but the man always considered the town of Leopoldina, where his residence is located and where had had multiple terms as mayor. Having only recently joined the national stage of politics, Luz became a federal representative only recently in the 1936 elections with the ED, but since then has managed to maintain a steady political career, but always distrusted the further left members of that alliance, whom he saw as spies for foreign countries at best. An accomplished man who has performed varied roles, such as teachers, police captain and bank manager, Luz both understands the economic realities of the nation's hinterlands and the poverty that it's small towns have to endure, and has always positioned himself in favour of a less centralized taxation system, which is an oddity in his own party."
POLITICS_JK_RJM_DESC:0 "Hailing from the city of Diamantina in Minas Gerais, Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira is the mother of a Mineiro father and a Czech mother, his middle name being the germanized spelling of Kubícek. After his father's death very early on his life, he began his studies, and eventually graduated from medical school and volunteered to aid in medical service during the Interstate War, and began his by now very long political career. Now faced with the challenge of ruling a nation wracked by war and in dire administrative straits, JK, as he is known by the people, has to not only deal with the ever competitive oligarchic politicians, but also with the ever looming threat of debt, as most taxation infrastructure did not make it past the war. But he also has big plans for both Rio and Belo Horizonte, cities in dire need of extensive public works, but already many in his opposition call these planes a ''hurricane of spending'', and yet he remains undeterred. Opposition to said remodeling is going to be especially complicated in Rio, where many attempts to do so have been thwarted in the past decades by numerous mayors and presidents."
POLITICS_TANCREDO_NEVES_RJM_DESC:0 "Born in 1910 in the city of São João del-Rei, southern Minas Gerais, Tancredo de Almeida Neves started to take an interest in politics as early as age nine, and already as a young man he opposed the then ruling party of his home state in the crisis that sparked the Interstate War. While he at first tried to volunteer for opposition militias, his remarkably poor aim and physical disposition had him rejected, and he spent the war at home, while having difficulties finding a job during the economic depression that hit the nation. Some years after the  interstate war, he joined the Republican party and began the slow climb through it's ranks, becoming a representative at city hall and the state legislature before heading to Rio's parliament. While his loyalties certainly lie with the Republicans, his somewhat moderate stances on key issues gave him a meaningful leg over other candidates, in what was a fairly contested election, even if the wanton violence of the war has been long left behind. His stances on economic and social issues are also why he has a relatively stable control of the upper and lower houses, but the complicated landscape left by the war may well surprise even the most skilled of politicians."
POLITICS_MACIEL_RJM_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_AFONSO_FEATHER_JUNIOR_RJM_DESC:0 "Born in the small town of Santa Barbara in Minas Gerais, Afonso Augusto Moreira Pena Júnior started his career like many other local politicians, studying law and becoming a state representative. Even though he is a very successful liberal and a respected literary intellectual, he always had to deal with the looming shadow that his father, former President of Brazil Afonso Pena, whose achievements and legacy always seemed difficult to deal with, but now he too has become a head of state and a president of his own right, but unlike his father, who was frustrated at every turn by powerful landlords and political opponents, Junior is determined to advance and modernize this newborn nation nation to the standard enjoyed by European powers, especially in its farthest reaches, both in terms of education and infrastructure development. However, said endeavours are certainly easier planned than followed through, even with a relative control over the ever turbulent politics of Rio and Minas, there is no shortage of opposition for the so called radical ideas put forward by Afonso."
POLITICS_ARAKEN_OLIVEIRA_HOS_DESC:0 "Born and raised in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Araken de Oliveira has always had the interests of Brazil at heart throughout his distinguished military career. A war veteran and respected officer, his current position as head of state is in no doubt due to the fact that only the remnants of the brazilian army can maintain law and order throughout Vera Cruz. While the suspension, at least for now, of any kind of elections for executive power is indeed a harsh measure, harsh measures have to be taken if this young nation is to succeed in re-establishing the rule of law in both its cities and hinterlands, a task Araken has to undertake for the sake of his home."
POLITICS_BELISARIUS_PITY_DESC:0 "Belisário Augusto de Oliveira Penna was born in Barbacena, Minas Gerais, in 1868, and began his political career as a city councillor in Juiz de Fora, and only in the 1920s he projected himself outside of his home state, positioning himself in favour of right wing tenentist uprisings. For most of his life, he was a doctor and has a belief in scientific principles being applied to politics and governments. While a supporter of radical integralism, he often found himself marginalized even among that radical movement due to his beliefs regarding eugenics, a concept which he pioneered in Brazil, and he was for many years a member of the Central Eugenics Committee. These viewpoints have also granted him many allies and admirers that share similar beliefs, and now he and his associates are in a prime position to apply their ideas as practical principle, to ensure the great cities of the land like Rio are finally cleansed of its poverty and superstition that hide under the guise of 'local culture'. Belisário is also a supporter of utilizing political prisoners as a workforce, a controversial and divisive viewpoint even among the right winger clique that now form his cabinet."
POLITICS_BIG_MOURA_JR_DESC:0 "Olympio Mourão Filho was born in 1900, in Diamantina, Minas Gerais. Having followed a fairly standard military career, his first active combat duty was during the interstate war, where he was among the defeated officers that sided with the federal government. He has since completely and utterly lost faith in the very concept of liberal democracy, and has written books on the subject of a new kind of state, an ''Integral Democracy''. His republican beliefs have kept him somewhat distanced from the AIB, even if they did enjoy his full support in their ideals of dismantling the carcass of the republic as it currently stood. To him, an organic democracy is the conclusion of his studies and ideology, which also changed as the war took a turn for the worse. Now in a position to truly rule and liberate the lands of Vera Cruz from the blight of marxism and liberalism, Mourão leads the newly formed integralist movement in conjunction with similarly minded officers, even if many of the more monarchic elements have been tossed to the wayside, and will do everything in his power to ensure that his political mantra, where the Army, Navy and Paramilitary Militias sustain a united and strong integralist state where faith in God and in the nation are the principles to be maintained, instead of idolatry of wealth and syndicalism."

## West Indies ##
POLITICS_SIR_EUSTACE_FIENNES_DESC:0 "Sir Eustace Edward Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes was given the title of Governor-General of the West Indies Federation on June 26th of 1925. Having previous experience with war, governorship of the West Indies, and politics within the United Kingdom itself, he's known for not being silent on his political opinions regarding the Federation. Some rumours have flown by stating that he plans on intervening in politics himself if the 1937 election gets out of control, but no substantial proof of these rumours has been supplied yet."
POLITICS_TUBAL_URIAH_BUTLER_DESC:0 "Tubal Uriah 'Buzz' Butler is a Grenadian Spiritual Baptist teacher in Trinidad and Tobago. Born in Grenada, Butler was unable to find work after completing his primary school education at the Anglican School, and chose to join the British West Indies Regiment when he was 17, fighting for the United Kingdom in the Weltkrieg and stationed in Egypt.\n\nAfter returning home in 1918, he became active politically, being influential in the establishment of the Grenada Representative Government Movement and the Grenada Union of Returned Soldiers.\n\nIn 1921, he moved to Trinidad, where he was exposed to the political thought of Marcus Garvey. He came to prominence in 1935, when he led a Hunger March in Port of Spain, and became an incredibly influential figure in West Indian socialism. Now, he leads the British Citizens' and Workers Home Rule Party and hopes to elevate the position of trade unions."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_LAGROSILLIERE_DESC:0 "Joseph Lagrosillière was born in Martinique on the 2nd of November, 1872. A very active French politician, Lagrosillière founded the Socialist Federation of Martinique (a branch of the SFIO on the island), and its newspaper Le Prolétaire.\n\nLagrosillière broke with the Parisian socialists in 1913, however, as they did not support the assimilation of colonies. Lagrosillière is a strong proponent of turning colonies into Departments, and the Federation of Martinique, without Lagrosillière, fell apart. It was revived in 1924 as the Second Federation. However, Lagrosillière continued his socialist advocacy in the Caribbean, continuing to become a politician in the West Indies Federation after the Weltkrieg.\n\nIn 1919, he made an electoral alliance with Fernand Clerc, a Béké industrialist on the island, which alienated him from his old socialist allies that criticized his 'alliance with capitalists'. He was arrested in 1925 for inciting trouble and violence, and again in 1931 for influence peddling.\n\nNow, Lagrosillière leads the PA and the West Indies into a new era of social democracy."
POLITICS_AIME_CESAIRE_DESC:0 "Born in 1913 on the island of Martinique, Aimé was from an early age greatly inspired by his grandfather Fernand Césaire who had been the first black teacher in the French colony who passed down a great deal of literary and scholarly aptitude to his grandson. After working his way through high school, Aimé Césaire journeyed to the Commune of France in 1931, disgusted with the colonial system of the West Indies and seeking to pursue the kind of higher education he had been unable to attain on his home island. During his sojourn at the Sorbonne University, he joining with a cadre of other black students, eventually founding a newspaper dubbed "L'Étudiant Noir" which promoted anti imperialist ideals and railed against the exiled French Republic's treatment of their colonial subjects. Aimé also coined the term Négritude, a literary movement promoting a revitalisation of African and Caribbean culture, as well as condemned the irreparable damage caused by the "decadent, morally degenerated parasites" who had oppressed his people. Due to his increasing conflicts with fellow students and teachers in the Commune, which he attributed to racial tensions and prejudice, Aimé eventually chose to return back to the West Indies Federation, just in time to bear witness to the people of the Caribbean cast off their chains. Invigorated by the struggle for liberation, he directed his revolutionary zeal and anti colonial fury towards building up and impressive line of credentials, penning radical treatises and holding fiery speeches on what he desired and demanded the new socialist government must due for the victims of imperialism. It was no surprise that in time, Césaire took it upon himself to see this dreams made reality, in a few years managing to rise to the top of the new Federation's political sphere."

POLITICS_FAN_YAONAN_DESC:0 "Fan Yaonan was first recongized by Qing official Zhang Zhidong and promoted within Hubei, and was able to save up enough to attend law school at Waseda University in Japan. After graduation, Fan served as a teacher at the Xinjiang Law School until his appointment as a judicial director. That year, the court was abolished and Fan traveled to Beijing to serve under the Beiyang Government. Passed up for the position of Dao-Yin of Dihua, Fan was appointed Dao-Yin of the more impoverished Aksu. Furthering his education, Fan leanred Russian at the Xinjiang russian Law School, and made efforts to promote cohesion between the newly arrived Russian immigrants to Aksu. In 1920, Governor Yang Zengxin appointed Fan as Xinjiang's representative to Russia, wherin Fan negotated a deal to end Russian tarrifs to Xinjiang until 1940. Fan Yaonan is know for his humbleness and quiet opposition to Governor Yang Zengxin's overtaxation of Aksu."
POLITICS_MA_SHAOWU_DESC:0 "Ma Shaowu's reputation was zlready colored by the exploits of his Sufi relative, Ma Yuanzhang, who had worked against Yang Zengxin's government and the Hanafi Hui warlord Ma Fuxiang. Ma Shaowu nonetheless spent his early years in the employ of the Qing and Yang Zengxin. Yang Zengxin was impressed by Ma Shaowu's loyalty, and appointed him to dispose of the warlord Ma Fuxing in 1924. Ma Shaowu was given the Dao-Yin of Hotan as a reward. Ma Shaowu's policy as Dao-Yin leaned more towards opposing aggressive Russian immigration, and held Ughiers and Mongolian residents in low regard. Following an assassination attempt by a Kirghiz turk, Ma Shaowu sought treatment for his broken legs in Russia, Ma Shaowu told his story to traveling journalist Peter Fleming, who commented on the resilience of the old man, as well as his ascetic lifestyle."

POLITICS_JIN_SHUREN_DESC:0 "Jin Shuren's career began in Gansu, where he served as the principle of the Qing-aligned Gansu Normal School. Jin used this position to pass the Imperial Civil Service Examinations, which got Jin the attenton of Yang Zengxin. When Yang was appointed Governor of Xinjiang in 1908, Jin became his district magistrate. The ensuing years of revolution depelted Yang's administrative staff, pusing Jin higher until he was appointed Comissioner of Civil Affairs in Urmuqi in 1927. Jin began to use his position as Comissioner to curry favor with several of the propogandizing movments coming from Southern China. The underground KMT movment and nascent Federalist movments regarded Jin as a model Han bureaucrat serving what they regard as undeserving provincials."
POLITICS_SHENG_SHICAI_DESC:0 "Sheng was born to an entrerprising but poor family in Manchuria, which paid for him to attend the Provincial Forestry and Agricultural School in Shenyang. Sheng went on to Waseda University in 1917, where he was introduced to a mixture of Sun-Yat-Sen rhetoric and the book 'ABCs of Socialism'. Sheng described himself as a Marxist upon his return in 1920, and decided to enter the military service. First fighting under Zhang Soulin in 1924, Sheng became incensed at the anti-intellectual policies Zhang esposed, and left for Japan once again to recieve more military training. Upon the faiture of the Northern Expedition, Sheng returned to China and joined the Guominjun under Fang Yuxiang in 1928. Following the destruction of Gansu, Sheng took a job offer from Fan Yaonan to lead the Aksu Garrison. Sheng became aware of Jin Shuren's foray into underground politics in 1935, and chose not to alert Yang Zengxin, due to his latent Marxist ideals against Yang's despotism."
POLITICS_BURHAN_SHAHIDI_DESC:0 "§YGeneral\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 3rd, 1894\nKazan Governate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§L\nBurhan Shahidi was born in 1894 in the Russian Kazan Governorate to a family whose ancestors had fled from Aksu after a failed peasant uprising during the Qing dynasty. His family was poor and he received little schooling in his early years. In 1912, after the Xinhai Revolution, Burhan accompanied Tatar merchants to Dihua in Xinjiang and worked as an apprentice and store-clerk. In 1914, Burhan was able to apply and receive Chinese citizenship from the Republic of China on account of his family's ancestry. He spoke Uyghur, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Turkish and some Arabic and acted as the interpreter for Xinjiang Governor Yang Zengxin. Burhan's relations to the Turkic community soured as a result of working under Yang Zengxin, and fellow Ughiers began to ostracize Burhan. Burhan's meager position in Yang's administration meant he was unable to mend this distrust, and the Ughier community's drift towards rebellion alienated Burhan further. Ultimately Burhan choose to attend courses at Baoding Army School starting in 1929, allwoging him to be hired by Yang as both an administrator and officer. Upon Burhan's return to Xinjiang in 1934, he found the administration in decline, and unable to correct the widening gap between the Ughier community and has resigned himself to being an effective public servant under what he considers the best possible administration to industrialize Xinjiang.

## Yemen ##
POLITICS_YAHYA_HAMID_DESC:0 "From 1934 onwards, Yahya redirected his energies toward internal consolidation of his authority and the creation of a viable central government, answerable to him personally. To this end, he now seeks to establish control over the Yemeni hinterland, establish a modern standing army, and establishing clear rules for succession of hereditary governorships, all while keeping a close eye on the tumultuous political environment in Sana'a itself. With al-Hamid at the helm, Yemen moves into the modern age while maintaining its semi-feudal state of affairs."
POLITICS_ALI_NASSAR_AL-QADARI_DESC:0 "The son of Sheikh Nasser bin Mas'ad. Ali Nasser had a common background. As a Sunni, he took up rebellion against Imam Yahya in 1928 when the Imam has imposed his rule over Aden. Al Nasser then fled the Imam's draft, and joined the rebels. The rebellion saw Ali Nasser tap into his artistic side, waxing poetic about his mission to kill the Imam. To this end, he joined the underground Hait al-Nadial organisation, and through his expressive voice became their leader."
POLITICS_SHABAB_AL-AMR_DESC:0 "Out of Ta'izz, the Numan family could be described as middle class. As a Sunni, Ahmad could not attain a proper education in Muslim science to advance in Yemen. This may have been due to rumors that his family was descended from Yemeni Jews. Instead, Ahmad was educated in western logic at the al Madrassa al Ahliyya. This school eventually played host to Ahmad's reform group Nadi a Islah. The Nadi a Islah saw both the Mutawakkili kingdom and the Ottoman Caliphate as relics that held back Yemen. He formed a program that disguised social reforms behind the terminology of reactionaries. Promoting the Good and Preventing the Bad was allowed his rebellion to sway otherwise conservatives Yemenis. Ultimately, this proclamation for Yemen was to ease change into a country badly divided."

POLITICS_YUNNAN_TANG_JIYAO_DESC:0 "A loyal follower of General Cai E, Tang began his political career in 1911, when Cai E ordered him to take part in the Wuchan Uprising, beggining the Xinhai Revolution. After the success of the revolution, he became governor of Guizhou and would later return to his home province of Yunnan in 1913 to replace Cai E. When Yuan Shikai announced his ambitions of becoming an Emperor, Tang immediately seceded with the support of the likes of Cai E and Li Liejun, who would spearhead the National Protection War alongside Tang. With their victory in the National Protection War, Yunnan became one of the main hegemons of the continent.\nSince then, Yunnan's glory days have long since faded away. Tang has led one failed expedition after another, with his failure in defeating Sichuan causing him to almost be deposed by Gu Pinzhen in a coup d'etat in 1921. However, the failure of the Northern Expedition became a blessing for Tang's control over Yunnan. With the threat of the Zili Clique and their German Patrons looming in the distance, the presence of the surviving NRA members as well as Tang's own forces have largely deterred them from taking action against a seemingly hostile Republican province. However, Tang's flamboyant and over ambitious character have largely alienated many of the officers residing in Yunnan, and his control over the province is much weaker than it seems from the outside."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_ZHU_PEIDE_DESC:0 "A scion of a distinguished Lufeng family, Zhu Peide could trace among his ancestors proud servants to the Ming Dynasty and loyal administrators of the Qing Empire. Despite his lineage, he alligned himself to Dr Sun Yat-sen's cause as a zealous and scholarly revolutionary. After a brief stint in Jiangxi as the province's chairman and a lengthy career in the Kuomintang, Zhu Peide fled into exile after the KMT's failed Northern Expedition. Alongside most of the remaining 3rd NRA army, he returned back to his home region of Yunnan, beginning to build up a new career within Tang Jiyao's administration.\nWhen Tang's government fell, Zhu Peide seized the oppertunity to rally the remnants of the Rightist Kuomintang and denounce Long Yun's takeover. Alongside his comrades, he marched west for Kunming and lead a successful takeover. Now comfortably seated in the capital of Yunnan, he has sworn to rebuild a National Government, honoring Sun Yat-Sen's legacy."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_LU_HAN_DESC:0 "Rumors have long circulated that Lu Han was the alleged half-brother of Long Yun, which is said to have been one of the reasons behind the two men's close comradeship. Whether that is the truth or not, it seems that whatever bond of blood or friendship existed between the two was not thick enough to prevent Lu Han from seizing this latest opportunity. The young Yi general has served with the Kuomintang, fought with the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang of Indochina, and now lead a daring coup against his former comrades. Lu has desperately gathered his forces in the capital and has set out to weather the coming storm. Yet the men around him wonder: can a man who betrayed his own supposed brother really be trusted?"
POLITICS_YUNNAN_HU_RUOYU_DESC:0 "The new administration was not to last, as the men who ousted Tang Jiyao have now turned their knives and guns on each other. Hu Ruoyu has made the first move, making a play to control the capital with the aid of his small band of followers. Unlike his peers, Hu came from a privileged family of scholars and landlords, yet found himself drawn to the revolutionary politics of the early 20th century. Under the patronage of Tang Jiyao, he climbed the ranks of the Yunnanese Army, eventually landing a comfortable position in the Kunming Military staff. With deep pockets and close connections to the officers and garrisons of the capital, Hu has made a risky gamble to oust and arrest his co-conspirators, proclaiming himself as Yunnan's new leader. Now time will tell if that risk will pay off..."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_LONG_YUN_DESC:0 "In his youth, Long Yun became inspired by the radical Anti-Qing student movements among his peers at the Yunnan Military Academy. He joined a local militia and fought in the Xinghai revolution, climbing through the ranks until he was serving under Tang Jingyu as commander of the Fifth Army, within the Yunnan Clique. His rise to power was helped by the close comradeship he held with his superior, as well as his alleged half-brother Lu Han. Yet in time, these friendships would be tainted with political rivalry and a heated competition for power in the declining revolutionary movement. It has taken many sacrifices, many betrayals and certainly regrets, yet Long Yun has now risen to lead the Yunnan Clique as its new warlord.\nLong's hold over Yunnan is tenuous but determined, he holds plenty of ambitions to remain a leading figurehead for the coming years, yet just like how he ousted his predecessor there's a distinct risk his own subordinates could turn on him at any minute. This is not helped by Long's ethnic background as a member of the Yi minority, although it has helped foster friendships between his administration and his kinsfolk. A pragmatist, an outsider to the Han political elite, and an ambitious warlord: 'The Dragon of Yunnan' may be a force for China to reckon with."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_ZHU_DE_DESC:0 "Famed as a man who rose from humble beginnings, Zhu De was nothing bit a dirt poor peasant, a simple tentant farmer in the Sichuan countryside. At nine years of age, he was taken in by a wealthy uncle and later sent to study at Yunnan Military Academy. His time at the academy saw him enlist in the Tongmenhui, the predecessor to the Kuomintang. The next years in Zhu De's life were a turbulent series of travels throughout China, fighting at various revolutionary fronts with the National Republican Army, serving various political factions and building up a great network of connections. From Sichuan to Shanghai, Tibet and even a brief stint as a student in Berlin, the roads of fate eventually lead Zhu De back to Yunnan. In recent years he fell afoul of the warlord Tang Jiyao's despotism, being driven to resign his position in the National Republican Army and promise to abstain from politics rather than face an umpteenth journey around the Asian continent.\nZhu De had perhaps expected to spend the rest of his life as a teacher at the Yunnan Military Academy, yet the news that Tang's government had fallen, and that all hell was breaking loose in Yunnan convinced him resurface from obscurity. Outwitting and outlasting the failed would-be despots of Yunnan, Zhu has set out with a simple goal, to here in Yunnan build the moral and responsible democratic institutions which he has studied, taught and dreamed of."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_LI_XIN_DESC:0 "Li Xin initially attended a German Private school in Kunming, where after he would study at various universities around the country. He first studied agronomy in Nanjing's South Eastern University, but was transferred to Beijing Agriculture University. During his stay in the Northern capital he became increasingly interested by foreign political thought, studying the failed Bolshevik movement in Russia and the now ascendant Syndicalist ideology in Europe. Throughout the 20s he grew increasingly closer to Syndicalism and later with other radical students at the university to form a political group named the "Renovation Society" in order to promote leftist views. After graduating in 1926, he traveled to Guangzhou and attended a lecture held by the Chinese Communist Party and Leftist Kuomintang on Agricultural Socialism. Although Li was at this point enamoured with Syndicalism, he accepted a request from the political representatives to join the Communist Party and help organise a political movement back in his home province of Yunnan. Dubbed the "Yunnan Special Branch", this group was initially meant to collaborate with its superiors but lost contact with the mother party following the failure of the Northern Expedition.\nLi, as one of the key figures in the group began to apply the same ideological currents which had dominated the Renovation Society, building an underground intellectual society of Syndicalist radicals in the heart of Kunming. This lead to a large schism between those loyal to the Special Branch's original beliefs, and Li's Syndicalist influence, eventually leading to Li's party founding 'Xindianshe' or 'The New Society' as a separate group. Despite his revolutionary convictions, Li has managed to remain below the radar of Tang's government. Initially several warlords in Yunnan were aware of his leftist beliefs, but had little reason to persecute a simple agricultural scholar. That all changed when Li Xin journeyed to various Yunnanese tin mines, hoping to organize the workers into a union. He even disguised himself as a miner, toiling away in hopes of growing closer to the proletariat. After organizing a wildcat strike in 1929 Li was almost arrested and executed, which forced him to go into hiding. Since then he has continued to grow his political influence, hoping to once more unite the Yunnanese workers and show the warlords what power truly lies in the hands of the proletariat."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_WANG_FUSHENG_DESC:0 "Wang's life was uneventful until he was admitted to Beijing University's Liberal Arts program. Early on he began to associate with radical student groups, getting to know several influential figures such as Li Xin and Li Dazhou. While many of his comrades dabbled in studying the newly resurgent Syndicalist movement that was sweeping through Europe and America, Wang remained a committed Marxist. He later joined Li Xin's "Renovation Society", a leftist group which promoted socialist ideology at Beijing University. During this time he witnessed many of his comrades be repressed, arrested and even executed by the Beijing government, driving him down a vengeful and authoritarian path. Much like his colleague Li Xin, he met with members of the Chinese Communist Party and Leftist Kuomintang, being similarly instructed to travel back to Yunnan and organize socialists within the province. The hope was to topple the warlord Tang Jiyao's hold over the south west, by founding a 'Yunnan Special Branch' of the Communist Party that could ferment revolution.\nYet the Special Branch was nearly annihilated when the Northern Expedition failed, and its superiors among the CPC and Leftist Kuomintang ended up scattered to the wind. Worst of all for Wang, his own comrades now began to turn on him. Rejecting the old authorities they had followed and beginning to rally around Li Xin's own syndicalist views. Outraged, Wang seized control of the special branch and moved to expel Li. During his tenure as leader of the underground revolutionary society, he worked to regain contact with whatever remnants of the Kuomintang or CPC might still be organized and continuing the fight in China. After years of silence and falls leads, he finally found them. The ZhongTeJu, and through a series of secret meetings, encoded messages and risky plans, the Yunnan Special Branch was restored to its original purpose: To ferment revolution against the Yunnan warlords. Despite his new superiors and the schism with his old comrades, Wang remains diligently committed to one single goal, revolution before all."

After the success of the revolution, he became governor of Guizhou and would later return to his home province of Yunnan in 1913 to replace Cai E. When Yuan Shikai announced his ambitions of becoming an Emperor, Tang immediately seceded with the support of the likes of Cai E and Li Liejun, who would spearhead the National Protection War alongside Tang. With their victory in the National Protection War, Yunnan became one of the main hegemons of the continent.\nSince then, Yunnan's glory days have long since faded away. Tang has led one failed expedition after another, with his failure in defeating Sichuan causing him to almost be deposed by Gu Pinzhen in a coup d'etat in 1921. However, the failure of the Northern Expedition became a blessing for Tang's control over Yunnan. With the threat of the Zili Clique and their German Patrons looming in the distance, the presence of the surviving NRA members as well as Tang's own forces have largely deterred them from taking action against a seemingly hostile Republican province. However, Tang's flamboyant and over ambitious character have largely alienated many of the officers residing in Yunnan, and his control over the province is much weaker than it seems from the outside."

From Sichuan to Shanghai, Tibet and even a brief stint as a student in Berlin, the roads of fate eventually lead Zhu De back to Yunnan.

He was a member of the Tongmenhui at a young age despite understanding little about Sun Yat-sen's vision for China initially. Educated by Cai E, he quickly rose through the ranks under the Guangxi Clique and he would personally rise to prominence through Yunnan's invasion of Guangxi in 1923. Gathering a significant force as Yunnan retreated, he aligned himself with the KMT forces and established the New Guangxi Clique after evicting the Old Clique from the province.\nDuring the Northern Expedition, Li’s skilled leadership of the Nationalist Seventh Army earned it the moniker of "Army of Steel", being one of the few NRA commanders to have defeated Wu Peifu on the field. However, the Expedition failed, and Li was forced to retreat to Guangxi, where he would be dislodged by a combined Old Guangxi-Guangdong force aligned with the Zhili Clique. The New Guangxi Clique then fled to Yunnan, protected by Tang Jiyao in order to safeguard his province's autonomy.\nAfter his defeat, Li Zongren focused on rebuilding his forces and consolidating, rapidly becoming the informal leader of the KMT's right-wing. From there, he plotted to invade Guangxi when the opportunity would present itself and re-establish a Nationalist presence in Southern China. That is, one not tainted by Wang Jingwei's French-dependent Central Committee and would truly reunite China first instead of \"playing revolutionary\" from a comfortable exile."

Facing obscurity or exile, the young commander was surprised to see his usurper, Tang Jiyao extend an olive branch after the Manchu Restoration and invite him back to Kunming. With a desperate need for competent, republican generals, Jin and Tang have to overlook their mutual distaste for each other and prepare for the inevitable confrontation with their northern enemy. As the democratic forces lick their found, Jin has also had the chance to reunite with some old friends, such as his former classmate Zhu De.

Although he was too young to participate in the Xinhai Revolution or the National Protection War, the stories of what was happening around China thrilled him. During his stay in Kunming he began reading political literature, both the more mainstream democratic manifestos but also digging into forbidden communist propaganda that had been outlawed under the warlord Tang Jiyao's rule. After attempting to organize political activities among his fellow students, he was expelled from the school. Outraged at this censorship, Zhao decided to leave Yunnan and join the Kuomintang's armies to the east. During the coming military campaigns he served as an officer under Zhu Peide, distinguishing himself thanks to his analytical mind and aptitude for strategic thinking. It was also around this time he first joined the Communist Party of China, but his hopes of working with fellow socialists both within the party and the Kuomintang was short lived. The failure of the Northern Expedition broke the democratic and socialist movements in southern China, forcing Zhao to flee back to Yunnan alongside his superior Zhu Peide. During his exile, he distanced himself from both the other rightist Kuomintang exiles. He began to correspond and meet with various members of the now scattered leftists, becoming a key liaison to them in Yunnan. Zhao has gone from leading students, soldiers and now exiles, but despite it all he still maintains a great skill for leadership and a zealous devotion to socialist ideals."

Although initially born with the name Dāo Yuè Chūn, he served as Tusi of the Nandian Prefecture up until the Xinhai Revolution. Sensing political change sweeping through China, Shou changed his name to Gong and began to promote an elaborate story that his family were in reality descendants of Ming dynasty soldiers who had occupied Yunnan. The decision to pass himself off as a member of the Han ethnicity earned Shou a considerable degree of influence in the post-revolutionary political climate, which he used to campaign against the attempted land reforms that would weaken the Yi people and their Tusi's autonomy. Although it landed him a stint in prison, he was later released and continued to live with this unique ethnic duality, spending some days as the Han politician Gong Shou and others as the Yi Chieftain Dao YueChun."
