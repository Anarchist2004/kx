austral.600.t: "A New Flag for Australasia"
austral.600.d: "With the Australasian transition to democracy, certain members of Labor have proposed to change the flag, as they see it as the flag of Birdwood's anti-democratic policies, however others have argued in favor of the current flag, especially from the National and Centre Parties. So now we must decide which flag to move forward with."
austral.600.a: "We won't bow down to leftists, keep the current flag."
austral.600.b: "We shall restore the Federation flag, to appease the people."
