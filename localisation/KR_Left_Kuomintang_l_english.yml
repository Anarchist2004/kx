POLITICS_CHI_SONG_QINGLING_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! January 27th, 1893, in Shanghai, Shanghai International Settlement\n§YPolitical Career:§! A rebel from her youth, Song Qingling explicitly challenged her parents' opposition to her marriage to the late and honourable Dr. Sun Yat-sen, going as far as to run away from home to elope with the revolutionary statesman. Western-educated, fluent in English and Chinese, graceful, elegant, and charitable - she demonstrated her utmost loyalty to the revolutionary cause when she told Sun to flee ahead of the warlord Chen Jiongming's bombardment, despite reportedly suffering a miscarriage and never being able to bear children again.\n\nLoyal to his side, she was with Sun when he agreed to work with the Third Internationale and was present at his deathbed when his final will was read aloud. And then came the Northern Expedition, in which she participated, untouchable and unchallenged by anyone within the Kuomintang due to her status as the widow of the great Dr. Sun. But when the expedition failed, she refused to see it as the revolution's failure. Instead, she and other leftist Kuomintang generals fled to the MinGan Insurgent Zone, where she spent her time travelling between the insurgent zone and Shanghai to secure aid and support for the guerrilla war against the despicable Zhili warlords.\n\nServing alongside her had been none other than her close friend - Deng Yanda. The two had been together since the halcyon days of the Guangzhou Revolutionary Government and found themselves united, a brother and a sister in the revolutionary struggle. Together they formed the Provisional Action Committee, with the belief that it must be up to them to fully realise the dream of the late Dr. Sun.\n\nAt last, however, she finds herself merely more than the figurehead of the MinGan Zone... no, she has ascended to the Chairwoman of the Kuomintang. Now, she commands not merely the mantle of the Chinese Revolution but the revolution for all oppressed peoples worldwide - the promise and dream of her late husband may soon finally become a reality."

POLITICS_CHI_WANG_JINGWEI_DESC: "§YLeader Description§!\n§YBorn:§! May 4th, 1883, in Sanshui, Guangdong Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! In his youth, Wang Jingwei was enamoured with the lives of Saigo Takamori and Katsu Kaishu, seeing them as model men who transformed Japan from a backwater into an industrial nation. How can it be that China is so stagnant, he wondered - turning to the works of Liang Qichao and Sun Yat-sen. In the latter, he saw a beloved mentor, and in Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui, he exploded into national prominence when he attempted to assassinate the Zaifeng regent (father of Emperor Puyi) despite his failure and imprisonment.\n\nWhen the Xinhai Revolution broke out, Wang was freed, but he refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the disillusioned Sun, who had found himself sidelined by national politics and the warlords. He instead travelled to France but returned shortly after Sun's triumphant return to Guangzhou in 1921 to participate in the newly founded Kuomintang's revolutionary government. Wang was present at the party's reorganisation in 1924, and slowly began to represent the party's growing leftist wing, although he hardly fancied himself as a socialist ideologue. When Sun died in 1925, Wang was present on his deathbed and helped write his will.\n\nThe triumvirate of Hu Hanmin, Chiang Kai-shek, and Wang Jingwei quickly became one of the Kuomintang's most contested and bitter power struggles. Wang emerged the victor following Hu Hanmin's death in 1925 and Chiang Kai-shek's assassination following the failure of the Northern Expedition, but the collapse of the expedition forced him and his political allies to flee to Europe in the hopes of one day returning to carry out Sun's revolution. In exile, he has consolidated his position as the leader of the Kuomintang's Central Committee, far and often distant from the MinGan insurgency on the mainland.\n\nAt last, he has returned and claimed his place as Chairman of the Kuomintang, leader of the Chinese revolution. With a large cadre of loyal supporters, the backing of the Internationale and other allies, Wang confidently strides forward as Dr. Sun's rightful successor.§!"

CHI_sun_fo_bio: "Sun Fo is the only son of Sun Yat-sen and was sent by the late revolutionary to Honolulu to be raised in safety by his uncle. There he received a mixed traditional and modern education, becoming a Columbia-educated scholar and writer. His father frequently sent him books to read, but never any by Marx and Engels, something he believed to be evidence that his father was not a Marxist.\n\nHe returned to become his father's secretary. This allowed him to become an expert in his father's writings - a means of connecting with his distant parent. In 1920 he was appointed Mayor of Guangzhou and, despite his youth, was proficient as an administrator - writing a 57 article provisional charter in one night. He built a small clique of young and non-corrupt technocrats dubbed the \"Crown Prince Clique\", promoting modernisation and liberalisation.\n\nAs his father sided with the left, Sun was marginalised by the new alliance - forced to resign his mayorship and go north to negotiate with Zhang Zuolin. He briefly considered an alliance with older right-wing elements but was ultimately cowed into submission.\n\nAfter the Northern Expedition failed, he was quick to attack Wang Jingwei's leftist leadership as he regrouped with his loyalists in Hawaii. Sun has emerged as the leader of the centre-right, liberal faction within the Kuomintang known as the Reconstruction Faction."

October 8th, 1879, in Anqing, Anhui Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! $CHI_chen_duxiu_bio$\n\nChen Duxiu takes up the mantle of leadership in a time of great strife. Victorious only with the aid of foreign powers, he has distanced his party from the thrice-failed Kuomintang, but nonetheless factionalism persists. The League, even within the Chinese Syndicalist Party, struggles to maintain cohesion despite being on the cusp of victory. Still, although these circumstances are far from ideal, Chen Duxiu is determined to make his vision for China a reality."
CHI_chen_duxiu_bio: "A lifelong experience of failing his Confucian exams taught Chen Duxiu one thing - that the old order had to go. Centuries of archaic decrepit institutions from the perfidious Manchus simply clogged the progression of mankind, especially in regard to the Marxist interpretation of history.\n\nIn 1915, he would go on to found the popular journal \"New Youth\" and joined fellow leftist educator Cai Yuanpei in Beijing where both men lashed out against the perceived backwardness of China and the necessity for a new model, a new method to allow China to enter the modern age and reassert herself in the world once more. In Beijing, he was attracted to Li Dazhao's Marxist study group and, when word broke out of the revolution in France in 1919, Chen Duxiu believed that syndicalism was China's natural progression in the Marxist paradigm; the Chinese workers and peasants would lead the revolution against the corrupt bourgeoisie and feudal warlords to save China from ruin. Inspired, in 1921 Chen Duxiu and other prominent socialist leaders gathered in Shanghai to proclaim the Chinese Syndicalist Party (CSP).\n\nWhen the Kuomintang rose up in 1923, the Commune of France's recognition of the Kuomintang was granted only on the condition that the Kuomintang accept the CSP as a junior partner in the national revolution. Emboldened, Chen and the CSP organised the greater League of Chinese Syndicalists in 1925. However, when the Northern Expedition ended in failure in 1927, the Chinese Syndicalist Party fled alongside the Kuomintang. Chen Duxiu headed for a life of secrecy and exile, changing locations frequently from friendly Guangdong to the narrow alleyways of Shanghai's red-light districts."

CHI_hu_zongnan_bio: "As a bright-eyed and ambitious cadet at the Whampoa Military Academy, the words on the gate of Whampoa were forever etched into Hu Zongnan's memory: \"Don't go past this door if you are greedy for life and fearful for death.\" In those halls, he distinguished himself as a cadet of Whampoa's very first class, despite being turned down initially due to his short stature (only accepted by the intervention of Liao Zhongkai). His distinguished participation in the Eastern and Northern Expeditions earned him the praise and favour of Chiang Kai-shek, but it was ultimately for nought in 1927.\n\nAfter a major falling-out with He Yingqin, Hu went abroad to France. Already older than most of his fellow students (and a former school teacher), he took on a natural leadership role among many equally dissatisfied officers who felt that the revolution had been betrayed. He kept a careful distance from his more extreme associates, however, allowing him to secure a position as Director of the Training Department within Whampoa while in exile. He has built a steady, secretive following around himself in Whampoa's \"Young Guard\"."

CHI_zeng_zongming_bio_desc: "Like many other youths, Zeng Zhongming and his sister Zeng Xing were caught up by the revolutionary fervour of the 1911 Wuchang Uprising. They went to study abroad in France, where they were joined by their fellow revolutionaries and friends: the newly wedded Wang Jingwei and Chen Bijun. Wang served as a mentor to Zeng, teaching him subjects ranging from history to literature, building a powerful bond.\n\nLiving in the Montargis suburbs south of Paris, they became acquainted with elder revolutionaries Cai Yuanpei and Li Shizeng. After the Great War broke out, Zeng, an educated young man, studied chemistry at the University of Bordeaux and French literature at the University of Lyon. From 1921 to 1924, Zeng served as the Chinese head of Lyon's Sino-French University, created by the new Syndicalist Government to sponsor a culture exchange between Chinese and French revolutionaries.\n\nIn 1925, Zeng returned to China to serve as Wang's secretary on the eve of the Northern Expedition, a job he retained after they fled to exile. He also married his childhood sweetheart Fang Junbi, a Chinese painter and daughter of a well-off Fujianese family. Within Wang's inner circle, there is no one he trusts more than Zeng Zhongming, and there is no disciple, perhaps, who is more faithful to the Chairman."

CHI_chen_gongbo_bio: "An early revolutionary, Chen Gongbo has travelled across the political spectrum before developing a comprehensive ideological platform of his own right. A prominent Marxist and representative of Guangdong's Chinese Syndicalist Party (CSP) branch, in 1922 he withdrew from the CSP due to his support for Chen Jiongming. In 1923, he went to study at Columbia University before being recruited in 1925 to the Kuomintang by Liao Zhongkai.\n\nFollowing the failure of the Northern Expedition, Chen fled along with the party to France. There he found his footing, becoming the \"chief ideologue\" of the party's radical wing. He also came under the influence of Wang Jingwei, serving as a protege and critical political ally.\n\nAs a testament to his loyalty, he co-founded with Gu Mengyu the Reorganised Comrades Association in France, a faction that claims to be the sole legitimate successor of the old Kuomintang government. Although Wang has refrained from direct membership, the RCA has served as a major vessel for carrying out Wang's directives, and Chen's prominence within the party quickly rose with the RCA. His work with the \"Revolutionary Critic\" laid out many of the policies now accepted as the Kuomintang orthodoxy, solidifying Chen's status as the premier leader of the RCA."

As shy of the public spotlight as he is ruthless, Dai is very rarely seen in public, but is known to be an indulgent playboy of a kind when off-duty."

At once both a brawling, vice-filled troublemaker and a prodigious student (first in his class), he studied to be a teacher but was expelled for theft. He then became a gambler, but was caught cheating and severely beaten. He also tried a variety of other careers before attempting to be a militiaman, flunking out of that as well.\n\nHe then tried to become a Shanghai gangster, meeting Du Yuesheng and Yang Hu and serving as a low level attendant who was often unemployed. At age 30, he seemed to be a failure, \"living off the land\" (and mooching off his cousin), if it wasn't for suddenly meeting with a small group of revolutionaries. This \"Shanghai group\" consisted of fellow Zhejiangers Chiang Kai-shek, Dai Jitao, and Chen Guofu. Perhaps because of them, or because of his connections in organised crime, he became a student at Whampoa.\n\nA bat-man for Chiang, he tried to make himself useful by absorbing information from his classmates. A cavalry cadet, he spent so much time spying that he never actually finished his coursework. He shed his flamboyant personality in favour of silence.\n\nThis served him well after the Northern Expedition failed. Unemployed once more and with his master dead, he set out to create a network of his own - the League of Ten. Tapping into the many now driftless Whampoa alumni as well as Dai's old connections in the Shanghai underground, they have become a potent (albeit small) force.§!\n\n§YNotes: It would not be wise to dismiss Dai as an ordinary gangster.

With the establishment of a newly proclaimed Chinese syndicalist country, Liu's established reputation and ties with the Chinese Syndicalist Party has granted him a prominent position in the Party's Executive Committee and he is ready to lead China to a socialist direction beyond the Kuomintang.§!\n\n§YNotes: A long standing member of the CSP, Liu is an Old Guard of the Party and holds the view that China must develop naturally through greater markets, greater material incentives for workers, and increased funding for consumer industries..§!"

CHI_MMIC_theorist_idea_desc: "§YMission Militaire Internationale en Chine§!\n§gDeployed to China by the Third Internationale following the League War, the MMIC is the evolution of prior socialist efforts to aid the Chinese revolution. Initially consisting of Red Russian émigrés fleeing their civil war sent to aid Dr. Sun in 1924, it has since drawn officers from across the socialist world in an international effort befitting of its sponsors.\n\nThe current head of the Mission is Frenchman André Malraux, who serves a dual role of advising the National Revolutionary Army and promoting it back home. Other figures include David Ramsay of Britain, Manabendra Nath (M.N.) Roy of India, Jean Fontenoy of France, Ingvald Berentin Aase of Norway, and Jakob Rudnik (Paul Ruegg) of Ukraine.\n\nA mixture of political and military officers, their motivations are mixed. Some are drawn by the excitement of an adventure on the other side of the world, others by the tantalising prospect of fame and advancement they could not otherwise achieve at home. Some simply wish to fulfil a sense of internationalist obligation, while others have an affinity for Orientalism.\n\nMany younger NRA officers, particularly those trained abroad or sympathetic to syndicalism, are quite fond of their MMIC trainers. However, they have drawn criticism for their willingness to engage in Chinese politics - seen as undue meddling of internal affairs by many in the Old Guard. The MMIC on the other hand, believe themselves to be the necessary counterweight to reactionary influences in the NRA high command.§!"

He married fellow Shandong native Cao Yi'ou and entered the employment of Yu Qiaqing - whose connections with the Kuomintang helped put Kang in contact with the KMT. After the KMT's return to China, Kang was approached by Zhou Enlai to head internal security operations of the newly created Zhongyang Teke in Shandong. It is here in Shandong where Kang has earned an infamous reputation as a sadistic interrogator, with his methods arousing the frustration of the Party's Central Committee and of Zhou Enlai.

His father worked for the American Standard Oil Company, and his proximity to the foreign concessions of Shanghai meant Mao grew an early distaste for the imperialists bent on carving up China. Related to its then Headmaster Chiang Kai-shek through his relative, Chiang's ex-wife Mao Fumei, Mao enrolled in the newly established Whampoa military academy in Guangzhou.\n\nIn 1927, he graduated from the Third Class of Whampoa Military Academy where he was taught by French advisors basic military training and topics. Unfortunately, he joined the Northern Expedition too late, watching it collapse and forcing him to flee abroad. In exile, he developed an interest in flying and aerial warfare, and he studied in British air academies.

In France he began to study aviation, receiving a commission in the engineering department of the Aviation Bureau of the Chinese Air Force. Despite the fairly obvious nepotism involved (his sister was determined to carve out a faction loyal to his husband within the NRA to oppose Chiang and other military factions), he is sincere about his desire to help the creation of a modern Chinese air force.§!\n\n§YNotes: Having arrived in China for the first time in his life, Chen is nonetheless an eager officer, though not necessarily the greatest option for command over the entire air force.

CHI_literacy_programs_desc:0 "Much of the rural population of China is too poorly-educated to be trained for modern warfare, let alone as specialists. A Minsheng-endorsed program to provide literacy education for both adults and children should be implemented as soon as possible to counteract these problems."
CHI_strike_AOG:0 "Seize German Capital"
CHI_strike_AOG_desc:0 "The robber-barons and imperialists of Germany have been content to let these local warlords abuse and harvest our nation's interior, while their commissioners idly collect the dividends in their 'treaty ports.' The KMT will not stand this any longer. Any capital held by the AOG shall be immediately requisitioned and any land seized must be taken from their foreign hands."
CHI_consolidate_control:0 "Consolidate Control"
CHI_consolidate_control_desc:0 "With our rebellion shifting towards conventional warfare, we must begin to also change our governing style as well. It is now essential that we begin governing the base region and other liberated territories as a functional state rather than as a secret rural government."
CHI_est_navy:0 "Establish Naval Presence"
CHI_est_navy_desc:0 "The Nationalists are in desperate need of a merchant marine and armed escorts that can connect us to friendly trading partners. Reorganizing the commandeered seaworthy ships seized by our armies will take time, but it is an important step towards creating a new Chinese navy."
CHI_jiangxi_rail:0 "Control The Central China Railroad"
CHI_jiangxi_rail_desc:0 "The Central China Railroad- a local name for the new lines that connect Zhejiang to the interior- are critical for our supply lines in this early period of the revolution. Up until now the railway has operated according to the demands of foreign capital, but we can run it more efficiently and with better purposes ourselves."
CHI_warlord_research_group:0 "Extra-Military Research Coordination"
CHI_warlord_research_group_desc:0 "Our alliances with the pro-KMT warlords will be ineffective if we do not cooperate to some extent. By sharing and mandating technical specifications with these armies, we can make sure that our forces and logistics will be able to operate anywhere that they need us to- or that we need them to."

CHI_provisional_code:0 "Provisional Legal Code"
CHI_provisional_code_desc:0 "During the early stages of the revolution, Chinese territory reclaimed by the Kuomintang has to be administered in a manner much different from the later democratic republic it will become. While supporting military operations must be prioritized, the Central Committee should also begin establishing civil courts and reintroduce the old organic law code to maintain peace, stability, and most importantly, tax revenues."
CHI_expropriate_landlords:0 "Expropriate Landlords"
CHI_expropriate_landlords_desc:0 "Private landlords control the vast majority of China's arable land, and as Black Monday's financial after-effects worm its way into the Chinese economy, tenant farmers suffer from ever-higher land rents. Rather than a more complicated process of regulating land rent rates, the KMT should instead seize the land of the largest landlords in liberated regions and return it to the farmers."
CHI_land_rent_caps:0 "Land Rent Caps"
CHI_land_rent_caps_desc:0 "Private landlords control the vast majority of China's arable land, and as Black Monday's financial after-effects worm its way into the Chinese economy, tenant farmers suffer from ever-higher land rents. Rather than simply seize and redistribute the land, the KMT should enforce a cap on land rent values to prevent the worst of the economic downturn from affecting agricultural workers."
CHI_land_tax:0 "Land Use Tax"
CHI_land_tax_desc:0 "The concept of a Land Value or Land Use Tax has been a policy darling of progressive reformers worldwide, and is most associated with the economic theories of Henry George. Since the earliest days of the KMT, the Land Use Tax has been unanimously approved by the party, and its legal implementation will ensure both a continual source of income and a passive means of fighting wealth accumulation."
CHI_opium_prohibition:0 "Opium Prohibition"
CHI_opium_prohibition_desc:0 "Opium has been the scourge of China since the beginning of the Century of Humiliation, and vast swathes of south-east China suffer from endemic opiate addiction. As a matter of national security and pride, we must not just eradicate opium production but also crack down on its trade and possession within controlled territories."
CHI_opium_tax:0 "Tax The Opium Trade"
CHI_opium_tax_desc:0 "Opium addiction and trafficking is a serious issue in China, but we realistically cannot do more than ban its production within our territories and crack down on smuggling. Prohibitive taxes on opium sold within legal channels will allow this vice to be used for the good of the country's treasury."
CHI_gannan_deal:0 "Gannan New Deal"
CHI_gannan_deal_desc:0 "There are proposals within the Minquan faction to turn Gannan Province into a model region for future Chinese development. Social programs such as state orphanages, free clinics and schools, and public housing may show to the world that even in the most remote regions of a wartorn China, the Nationalists are dedicated to improving the quality of life for all citizens."

CHI_yangste_offensive:0 "Prepare Lower Yangtze Offensive"
CHI_yangste_offensive_desc:0 "The League of Eight Provinces is shattered, but its core, the Nanjing Clique, still survives and may stabilize itself soon. To finally upend the status quo in Southern China, we need to strike at their center of power in Jiangsu Province. Our ace in the hole is the ZhongTeJu bureau, which has filled the Clique's territory with Nationalist cells that will surely cause mass sabotage of their defences."
CHI_contact_cells:0 "Reorganize Nationalist Cells"
CHI_contact_cells_desc:0 "As more of China is liberated from the warlords, the KMT's structure as an underground party becomes pointless. We need loyal and competent party members to help administer the governments of the prefectures, and these local party members are the ideal candidates. Party cells in controlled regions should be reorganized into regional Party Directorates until a more formalized government is established."
CHI_handle_SQI:0 "Handle The Millenarians"
CHI_handle_SQI_desc:0 "The province of Shandong has been brought directly into contact with us thanks to the League War. If we are to ever take China for the people we must deal with this potential threat, preventing it from spreading through the south east."
CHI_VNQDD_liasons:0 "Liason with DVQDD Rebels"
CHI_VNQDD_liasons_desc:0 "The DVQDD, or 'Dai Viet Kuomintang,' is our sister organization in Indochina and is just as devoted to the cause of democratic anti-imperialism in Asia as we are. With our borders touching the Indochinese region, we may be able to more closely aid and cooperate with them as part of their work within the wider world of native Indochinese politics."
CHI_HNN_intervention:0 "Support KMT in Hunan"
CHI_HNN_intervention_desc:0 "The only remaining democracy in Hunan was discovered by some members of the Kuomintang. However, Hunan Clique is still firmly controlled by non-KMT forces, and our revolutionary progress is developing very slowly there. By expanding the influence of KMT in Hunan Province, it will make it easier for us to revolutionize."
CHI_chen_mingshu_reconcile:0 "Support KMT in Liangguang"
CHI_chen_mingshu_reconcile_desc:0 "Leader of Liangguang KMT is a oddity among the rogue NRA generals in that he favours left-wing politics, but he is totally opposed to the more authoritarian factions within the Chinese left. With the Central Committee's new alignment towards the democratic principles of the Minquan, we have a rare opportunity to peacefully reunify the region through negotiated talks."
CHI_plan_southern:0 "Unite Southern China"
CHI_plan_southern_desc:0 "The Kuomintang must control or pacify the rest of Southern China before any attempt at a second Northern Expedition can take place. To this end, the National Revolutionary Army must begin planning expeditions against the remaining independent southern warlords with the intelligence and special operations aid of the ZhongTeJu."
CHI_SZC_intervention:0 "Reconcile with KMT in Sichuan"
CHI_SZC_intervention_desc:0 "In the chaotic world of Sichuanese politics, the Officer Department is the only group with a favourable view of the KMT. By supporting Officer Department in their provincial power struggles, we could gain a valuable ally, or even control of the entire province through them."
CHI_YUN_reconcile:0 "Reconciliation with KMT in Yunnan"
CHI_YUN_reconcile_desc:0 "After the Northern Expedition, the remnants of the armies controlled by the Right KMT found refuge in Yunnan province. With the victory of the Center-Right KMT in Yunnan's recent power struggles, we may have a chance to mend the old Nationalist party together and form a powerful front to unify South China together."
CHI_plan_western:0 "Plan Western Expedition"
CHI_plan_western_desc:0 "The far-western regions of Yunnan and Sichuan may seem like a sideshow to the struggle for dominance of China, but securing their loyalty and resources may prove the difference between victory and defeat. Without any other paths towards a diplomatic solution, we may have to resort to a military campaign against the south-western warlords."

CHI_mingshu:0 "Chen Mingshu Victorious"
CHI_mingshu_desc:0 "With the KMT revolt in Fujian a failure it is now up to Chen Mingshu to ensure China is under Kuomintang rule. There are still problems facing Chen such as the poweful gentry and merchants, on top of that there is unrest in Liangguang which we will need to deal with."
CHI_National_Plan:0 "The National Plan"
CHI_National_Plan_desc:0 "With the National Plan we can use elements of Chen Jiongmings government to make the integration of China a lot more easier. This is because his form of government was based off the American states which makes it more appealing for the governors as they can retain some autonomy for the time being."
CHI_Respect_Chen_Jiongming:0 "Implementing Guangdong Policies"
CHI_Respect_Chen_Jiongming_desc:0 "The lands of the potential United Provinces are under our control however that doesn't mean we can't fulfil Chen's legacy. If we fine tune his ideals to fit with ours we could gain a large amount of wealth and support from the people."

If we try to bring Social programs such as state orphanages, free clinics and schools, and public housing to other provinces in our control we may show to the world that even in the most remote regions of a wartorn China, the Nationalists are dedicated to improving the quality of life for all citizens."
CHI_Consolidate_Liangguang:0 "Consolidate Liangguang"
CHI_Consolidate_Liangguang_desc:0 "The pressing issues that arose both before and after the civil war still need to be addressed, until they are sorted the Northern Expedition will have to wait until a later date which gives the enemy more time the prepare."
CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangxi:0 "Control the Unrest in Guangxi"
CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangxi_desc:0 "Guangxi has not been spared the turmoil that has gripped large parts of China following the collapse of the League. Our new administration must tend to the unrest in this province, be it from reactionaries, bandits or Yiguandao agitators."
CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangdong:0 "Control the Unrest in Guangdong"
CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangdong_desc:0 "Much of this province still bears the influence of warlord dominance that threaten the stability of the people's government. Efforts should be made to put an end to their influence."

CHI_Gentry_Concession:0 "Provide Gentry Concessions"
CHI_Gentry_Concession_desc:0 "The gentry and their excesses are a product of a bad system. Instead of taking a heavy-handed approach, we can make concessions towards them and win their support. It'll be easier than fighting them every step of the way, allowing us to move forward with our reforms without major disruptions to the existing economic infrastructure."
CHI_Gentry_Force:0 "Crack Down on the Gentry"
CHI_Gentry_Force_desc:0 "The upper classes are but leeches that suck the blood out of the worker. Their excesses end here. We'll make them abide by the rules just like everyone else and work just like everyone else. There will be some inevitable transitional pains to the economy, but it's a price worth paying for justice."
CHI_Merchants_Concession:0 "Provide Merchant Concessions"
CHI_Merchants_Concession_desc:0 "While it's true that the merchant classes have lived off the people, we can't uproot the entire commercial system overnight. By making certain concessions to the merchant classes to have them support us and adapt to our rule, we should see a smoother transition for the people's government."
CHI_Merchants_Force:0 "Crack Down on the Merchants"
CHI_Merchants_Force_desc:0 "We cannot count the number of times that the merchants have squeezed every last penny out of the commoner without a care for his plight. It's time that we started to put the screws on these jackals and have them contribute to the common good for a change, even if that means that there will be a period of adjustment."
CHI_Revoloution_Secured:0 "Revolution Secured"
CHI_Revoloution_Secured_desc:0 "Our revolutionary brothers and sisters may have fallen, but not in vain. We shall pick up the torch of revolution where they left off and continue their work towards a better China. Through us, the Kuomintang rises again like a mighty phoenix!"

CHI_form_army:0 "The 2nd NRA"
CHI_form_army_desc:0 "We are now in open revolt, and as such our military forces must move from insurgency tactics back to conventional warfare against the Warlords. More units must be raised in larger formations, and in doing so we will form a Second National Revolutionary Army to finally unify China."
CHI_regional_militias:0 "Regional Militias"
CHI_regional_militias_desc:0 "With the collapse of League authority in Fujian and Jiangxi province, local self-defence societies have formed to maintain order. We must try to integrate them into the NRA's structure as regional militias to bolster our small core forces."
CHI_one_army:0 "One-Nation-One-Army Policy"
CHI_one_army_desc:0 "Local forces loyal to a general or town instead of the Party-State cannot be trusted, and relying on them is a devil's bargain. These bandits and petty warlords need to be neutralized by security sweeps before they can establish themselves. The byline of 'One-Nation-One-Army' should be taken to heart in our military planning and future expansion of the NRA."
CHI_tigress_battalions:0 "Tigress Battalions"
CHI_tigress_battalions_desc:0 "The NRA has seen the equal valor of women in combat, though it has not yet developed any programs to fully allow women to participate as enlisted soldiers or officers. Upon the urging of Song Qingling, the NRA has begun a formal program to train women as officers and soldiers. The program also envisions training all-female 'tigress battalions' for front line and garrison duties."
CHI_peoples_army:0 "Prioritize Manpower"
CHI_peoples_army_desc:0 "China has a vast population, and we should expect our enemies to have vast armies as well. Trying to outperform our enemies by investing in a quality that our industries are in no shape to supply will cause our armies to be greatly overwhelmed by the sheer size of warlords armies that have built up over time. Nothing less than turning the NRA into a mass People's Army will suffice given the foes we are up against."
CHI_modern_divisions:0 "Prioritize Modernization"
CHI_modern_divisions_desc:0 "Any new Chinese army needs to be founded again from first principles as a modern force. While we should try to maximize the number of units raised for the war, our equipment procurement and plans for expansion should prioritize creating new and modern forces that are not just superior to the haphazard divisions of the warlords, but equal in quality to those of western powers."
CHI_asymmetrical_warfare:0 "Asymmetrical Warfare"
CHI_asymmetrical_warfare_desc:0 "As we evolve the National Revolutionary Army from a guerrilla force into a fully fledged army, our vast experience in fighting unconventionally against the rigid formations of the warlords should be developed, not squandered. By having our training empathize this we'll be able to excel where purely conventional armies struggle."
CHI_dare_to_die:0 "Dare-To-Die Corps"
CHI_dare_to_die_desc:0 "It is a sad fact that in these desperate times, often all a man is able to give to a cause is his life. The concept of 'Dare-To-Die' soldiers as patriotic martyrs dates back to the Xinhai Revolution, but during the Warlord Era the term expanded to refer to all small units tasked with suicidal attacks. As the war expands Dare-To-Die tactics and the original Xinhai spirit that accompanied it begin to show their appeal."
CHI_airborne_corps:0 "Airborne Corps"
CHI_airborne_corps_desc:0 "Control of the skies in the wars for China is both possible and plausible, and it is under these conditions that we can try to establish our own airborne corps similar to those of other nations. A properly-placed paradrop will allow our forces to develop new flanking manoeuvrers and keep our enemies fearful of the skies."
CHI_conscription:0 "Conscription Squads"
CHI_conscription_desc:0 "Unfortunately, forming an adequately-sized army on volunteers alone is not possible at this stage in the revolution. By forming special task forces to enforce conscription in liberated territories, our armies can more easily reach their projected build-up quotas."
CHI_mechanized:0 "Mechanized Warfare Study Commission"
CHI_mechanized_desc:0 "Armoured vehicles have been sparse in Chinese warfare, but regardless of our opinion that will not be for long. As a matter of national security, the Nationalists should be the first faction in China to study, perfect and introduce motorized vehicles and tank warfare into the Chinese theatre in mass numbers."
CHI_stratified:0 "Stratified Unit Quality"
CHI_stratified_desc:0 "Due to the size and scope of the NRA's forces, we cannot realistically make all of our forces trained or equipped to the same quality. Our backline and low-priority units should be de-prioritized in terms of equipment and training in order to maximize the quality of our front line troops."
CHI_blocking_detachments:0 "Encirclement Detachments"
CHI_blocking_detachments_desc:0 "The rugged and mountainous regions of China are far beyond the capacity of regular troops to adequately navigate. For future campaigns in China and beyond, specialized detachments of infantry need to be trained for mountain warfare against smaller local forces."
CHI_modern_combined_arms:0 "Modern Combined Arms"
CHI_modern_combined_arms_desc:0 "The art of synchronising artillery, infantry, and armour into a successful offence is still new, but we cannot let other powers develop the perfect implementation ahead of us. The National Revolution's wars will allow us to learn what technical specifications are needed to create ideal arms and artillery for modern wars."

CHI_restore_whampoa:0 "Restore The Academy"
CHI_restore_whampoa_desc:0 "The old military academy in Whampoa was officially disestablished after the German intervention in China occupied Guangdong Province in 1925, but its staff, records, and other resources all survived and are currently spread across the world. We are now in a position to re-found the Republic of China Military Academy and begin training our officer corps independent of other powers."
CHI_nat_air_army:0 "National Air Army"
CHI_nat_air_army_desc:0 "Up until now the NRA's doctrine and use of military aircraft has been largely hypothetical or improvisational. However, the Weltkrieg has proved that air power in modern warfare is an undeniable factor in victory. With the growth of our industrial base and funds allowing for actual air fleets to be assembled, we can now fully commit to establishing a new branch of the NRA- the National Air Army."
CHI_flexible_aircraft:0 "Flexible Aircraft Specifications"
CHI_flexible_aircraft_desc:0 "China does not have the mechanical skill or industrial depth to have the best native avionic designs for each application of air power in war. Because of these constraints, it is best to focus on producing cheap, reliable, and flexible plane designs that can work as both support craft and strategic bombers."
CHI_heavy_airframes:0 "Heavy Airframes Focus"
CHI_heavy_airframes_desc:0 "China is vast, and our air force will be stretched thin to cover all combat regions. Prioritizing the development of long-distance, heavy-frame aircraft can allow us to let air wings be strategically flexible in their choice of targets or supporting missions."
CHI_build_airfields:0 "Strategic Airfields Initiative"
CHI_build_airfields_desc:0 "It is easier to build an airfield than a highway, and in the underdeveloped Chinese interior roads are scarce. Building strategic airfields at key regions in provinces will allow for both better communication with the Central Government and also allow for air support in nearby battle zones."
CHI_naval_aviation:0 "Coast-to-Ship Air Support"
CHI_naval_aviation_desc:0 "Naval aviation in the sense of carrier forces is currently beyond China's capability or needs, but torpedo bombers and sea planes are necessary for any proactive coastal defence. Anti-ship squadrons that are stationed on land will be just as useful in repelling attacks and securing littoral zones as any aircraft carrier."

CHI_separate_naval_command:0 "Separate Naval Command"
CHI_separate_naval_command_desc:0 "Up until now much of the Republic of China Navy has been effectively subordinated to the needs of the NRA. However, any nation that wants security on its own terms needs to have a strong navy. As victories mount on land, Admiral Chen Shaokuan has pushed for more independence for the Navy and for serious consideration of building up a navy capable of independent operations at sea."
CHI_coastal_fleets:0 "Light Ship Focus"
CHI_coastal_fleets_desc:0 "China's naval forces have always been reliant on foreign shipyards and designers for its fleets. The first generation of all-Chinese fleet production should focus on the development of light and heavy cruisers for the most economical and versatile results, as opposed to plunging into the more doctrinally-uncertain world of battleships and carriers."
CHI_coastal_defenses:0 "Coastal Defence Stratagems"
CHI_coastal_defenses_desc:0 "China's greatest naval concern is securing its coastline against the imperial powers. Coordination between all involved parties- coastal NRA garrisons, air wings, and the navy- should be enforced by the Central Government and specific mixed-service chains of command and protocols should be pre-established to prevent any operational chaos."
CHI_integrate_beiyang_navy:0 "Fate of Beiyang Naval Staff"
CHI_integrate_beiyang_navy_desc:0 "The Nationalist government's navy is small and lacking in trained officers. While the warlordism of the Zhili army is irredeemable, the Beiyang Navy's command structure may have enough officers of decent moral quality that it may be beneficial to review their records and offer the trustworthy a commission now that the Qing and Zhili jackals have finally been put down."
CHI_submarine_doctrine:0 "Study Submarine Warfare"
CHI_submarine_doctrine_desc:0 "Submarine warfare has allowed other nations with a seeming naval disadvantage to strike fear into the merchant marines of their enemies. Given the effectiveness of these forces during the Weltkrieg and afterwards, many admirals argue that the ROCN should turn towards submarine warfare as a way to leapfrog past the old paradigm of surface navies with vulnerable capital ships."
CHI_naval_infantry:0 "Chinese Naval Infantry"
CHI_naval_infantry_desc:0 "The modern art of coastal landings opens up not just unexpected feints across the Yellow Sea or Gulf of Hanoi, but also the retaking of Taiwan from the Japanese. A joint program by the NRA and ROCN to develop specialized naval infantry regiments will help to keep our enemies on their toes and our strategic options as open as the ocean's horizon."

CHI_military_affairs_cmsn:0 "Military Affairs Commission"
CHI_military_affairs_cmsn_desc:0 "With the expansion of the NRA into multiple branches in multiple front regions, a new central command overseeing all theatres of the revolution must be established. Though a formality, this commission should ensure that all decision-makers are on the same page and know our capabilities."
CHI_sanmin_commissars:0 "Sanmin Political Commissars"
CHI_sanmin_commissars_desc:0 "The National Revolution that we are fighting for is not just a series of military campaigns, but a social and political revolution. We must make sure that our officers make field decisions in accordance with the Three Principles of the People and our political goals. To this end, the Party has assigned political commissars to military units both for education in Sanmin ideology and to advise officers in political affairs."
CHI_special_methods_division:0 "Special Methods Division"
CHI_special_methods_division_desc:0 "As we liberate more and more provinces of China from the warlords and nobles it's inevitable that the resistance from those that benefited from their regimes will resist us. To overcome this, we'll train and deploy specialized commissars to deal with reactionaries behind the lines to suppress the reactionaries."
CHI_retake_taiwan:0 "Go Forth and Reclaim Taiwan"
CHI_retake_taiwan_desc:0 "The island of Taiwan was surrendered to Japan after the first Sino-Japanese war and has suffered under their jackboot ever since. With our positions on the mainland secured and both our army and navy built up, we're finally in a position to liberate our Taiwanese comrades from the Japanese yoke once and for all."

CHI_1st_congress:0 "1st Repatriated Congress of The KMT"
CHI_1st_congress_desc:0 "After a decade overseas, the Central Committee of the KMT has returned to China in triumph. Now that the initial war against the Nanjing Clique is complete, the KMT has enough breathing room to reorganize and plan its future path towards national reunification."
CHI_1st_congress_GXC:0 "1st Repatriated Congress of The KMT"
CHI_1st_congress_GXC_desc:0 "After the decisive defeat of the KMT in Fujian the Left Kuomintang was thought to be over for good. This changed however as Chen Mingshu managed to bring the revolution to Liangguang and prevent the fall of republicanism in China. Now that many internal issues have been put to rest, the KMT has enough breathing room to reorganize and plan its future path towards national reunification."

CHI_revive_china:0 "Revive China Program"
CHI_revive_china_desc:0 "Without the Nationalist Party, there will be no new China. A vast program of extensive state planning and initiatives is necessary to bring China back up to the same level as the West."
CHI_national_RC:0 "National Reconstruction Commission"
CHI_national_RC_desc:0 "Inspired by proposals drafted by Zhang Renjie, a centrally-directed National Reconstruction Commission should be formed by the Nationalist Government to plan a nationwide program of capital investments and standardizations. This program will involve multiple independently-scaling efforts centred around several major population areas."
CHI_1st_industrial:0 "First Industrialization Phase"
CHI_1st_industrial_desc:0 "The first planned phase of industrialization for each base region will involve expanding the infrastructural capacity and heavy industries needed for future construction."
CHI_standard_rail_gauges:0 "Standardized Railway Gauges"
CHI_standard_rail_gauges_desc:0 "Railway development in China has been sporadic in particular the warlord governments have intentionally chosen gauges different from those of their regional rivals to prevent any easy invasion, and foreign firms would use whatever gauge was cheapest to build tunnels and bridges for. As part of our industrial programs, we must invest time and effort into converting all our railways to the standard gauge."
CHI_2nd_industrial:0 "Second Industrialization Phase"
CHI_2nd_industrial_desc:0 "The second planned phase of industrialization for each base region involves the development of factories reliant on fine tooling, such as consumer goods and military munitions."
CHI_natl_dockyard:0 "National Dockyard Effort"
CHI_natl_dockyard_desc:0 "As part of our larger industrialization plans, major ports under our control should have their capabilities for shipbuilding and repair expanded."
CHI_academica_sinica:0 "Academica Sinica"
CHI_academica_sinica_desc:0 "To better foster the development of our native scientific capabilities, the KMT must commit to creating and sponsoring our own academic research institutions. Long proposed but never enacted, the fully established Academica Sinica will be the centre of these efforts."
CHI_bopomofo:0 "Bo, Po, Mo, Fo..."
CHI_bopomofo_desc:0 "The current methods for romanizing Mandarin Chinese and even teaching the Chinese script are woefully inadequate for children or the everyday person. A new standard for phonetic symbols, similar to the Hiragana syllabary created for Japanese, should be created and spread throughout our educational system to help standardize the Chinese dialects and open mass conversation with the West."
CHI_foreign_research:0 "Foreign Research Partnerships"
CHI_foreign_research_desc:0 "Like it or not, the Nationalist Government cannot modernize the country without working with the international scientific community. By forming research and graduate training agreements with friendly foreign powers, we can start to build up China's own scientific prowess"

CHI_proclaim_new_republic:0 "Assert Independence from Beijing"
CHI_proclaim_new_republic_desc:0 "Our government's independence from Beijing has been self-evident for some time. Declaring an official declaration of independence, whilst only giving us some support within our government, will show our opposition to the Qing monarchists. This act will remind the world that we are not just 'The Kuomintang' but instead the Nationalist Government and the rightful heir to the Xinhai Revolution."
CHI_choose_capital:0 "Choose the Republican Capital"

chi_dom.1.t:0 "Return of the Central Committee"
chi_dom.1.d1:0 "After a long and tension-filled voyage from Paris, the KMT's Central Committee has arrived at the newly-captured port of Wenzhou. Because of the ongoing state of chaos in southern China, this was a quiet affair with little in the form of pomp. Wang Jingwei later delivered a brief statement outside the customs office to reassure local citizens that peace in Wenzhou would be ensured.\n\nAlong with the Nationalist Government-In-Exile, a French-trained and equipped regiment of Chinese expatriates has arrived to assist in securing southern China, along with stocks of Weltkrieg-era rifles and ammunition."

chi_dom.1.d3:0 "After a long and tension-filled voyage from Paris, the KMT's Central Committee arrived in small groups through the legation port of Fujian and has traveled secretly to Longyan. Because of the ongoing state of chaos in southern China, this was a quiet affair with little in the form of pomp. With Song Qingling present, Wang Jingwei later delivered a speech outside Longyan's City Hall, congratulating the JiangFu soldiers in holding out thus far.\n\nAlong with the Nationalist Government-In-Exile, a French-trained and equipped regiment of Chinese expatriates returned via Fujian's ports in small squads. A large cache of smuggled rifles and ammunition provided by the Commune is currently being distributed via backchannels."
chi_dom.1.a:0 "Welcome back, Chairman Wang."

chi_dom.2.t:0 "The Harvest of 1936"
chi_dom.2.d:0 "Before the National Revolution began, the soldiers living in the Jiangxi-Fujian Insurgent Zone would assist local peasants in the autumn rice harvests. With the NRA back to fighting a conventional struggle, there are less hands than usual to help the heart of the revolution with agriculture."
chi_dom.2.a:0 "They'll have to get used to these changes for the greater good."
chi_dom.2.b:0 "Divert new recruits to get some moral training in the fields."

chi_dom.3.t:0 "Leader of The Sanqingtuan"
chi_dom.3.d:0 "Recently, Dai Chunfeng has suggested calling for more youths to participate in the revolution of Three People's Principles. The proposal of establishing the Sanqingtuan is regarded by most people as a sign of ZhongTeJu’s expansion. However, much to their surprise, it seems that Dai Chunfeng is unlikely to directly appoint a leader of the Sanqingtuan, which offers us an opportunity. Zhou Enlai proposes that the splendid Youth general\nXiao Ke is best qualified for this position due to his superior leadership skills, while Song Qingling suggests our “Big Sister” Cai Chang is the better choice, as her image as the “Tigress soldier” will make for excellent propaganda."
chi_dom.3.a:0 "Choose Cai Chang"

chi_dom.5.t:0 "Incidents in Wenzhou"
chi_dom.5.d:0 "Occupation plans for Wenzhou and the other A.O.G. ports have been severely lacking compared to the meticulous steps and lines of advance drawn around Xiamen. When NRA forces occupied the city of Wenzhou, spontaneous anti-foreign riots began all across the city, leading to the murders of numerous German residents and the looting of much of the city's uptown districts. To complicate matters, several smaller advance groups of Nationalist troops also participated in the looting until more disciplined units arrived to secure the area. Wenzhou is now significantly damaged from the civil unrest."
chi_dom.5.a:0 "Another mess for our foreign secretary to sort out."

chi_dom.6.t:0 "Tragedy in Nantong"
chi_dom.6.d:0 "The port of Nantong had been leased by the League of Eight Provinces to the A.O.G., and its position at the mouth of the Yangzte allowed it to act as a German-exclusive alternative to the International City of Shanghai. The advancement of the NRA towards the treaty port caused mass panic and unrest among many of its residents. Widespread looting by Chinese natives combined with scorched-earth tactics by German security forces have lit up the sky above Nantong, and the ensuing fires have wiped out many of the textile factories. An exodus of ferries heading south towards Shanghai were overcrowded and unsuited to trips outside the Yangzte, leading to several of the boats capsizing with hundreds of deaths reported. Before the NRA could do anything to control the situation, it became clear that Nantong was a disaster area. Long seen as an exemplar of how Chinese cities could be modernized, Nantong has effectively been sacked."
chi_dom.6.a:0 "A great loss for the country."

chi_dom.7.t:0 "Fujianers in Hangzhou"
chi_dom.7.d:0 "Most of the National Revolutionary Army's first units were raised in Fujian Province from local peasants and the rare urban native, and few if any of these regular troops are familiar with the standard Mandarin dialect. Yesterday a group of Fujianer soldiers on leave in Hangzhou caused a scene when language difficulties and drunkenness led to a fight with local Hangzhou residents. Despite the view of China as one nation, language difficulties and the sharp contrast between rural and urban lifestyles will make stationing most units outside of their home areas difficult."
chi_dom.7.a:0 "It's an unavoidable problem of national unification."

chi_dom.8.t:0 "The Zhou Fohai Affair"
chi_dom.8.d:0 "The Yiguandao movement may be associated with Shandong province, but adherents can be found throughout China. At the 1929 Party Congress, the Kuomintang resolved that none of its members could also belong to any charismatic spiritual movements, chief among them being the Yiguandao. With the National Revolution now fighting against the forces of the Mad Mystic Zhang Tianran, the ZhongTeJu has begun extensive counter-intelligence sweeps to purge secret Yiguandao practitioners.\n\nThe most prominent secret Millenarian revealed so far has unexpectedly been Zhou Fohai, a Minquan faction member. Zhou has resigned all his posts under duress by the Central Committee and has now been expelled from the party. His accusation and arrest has caused a scandal within the Nationalist government."

chi_dom.9.t:0 "The Premiere of Mulan Cong Jun"
chi_dom.9.d:0 "Today saw the premiere of one of the first feature films created under Nationalist China's rule. Directed by Bu Wancang and with young Chen Yunchang playing the lead, Mulan Cong Jun (Mulan Joins the Army) is a historical period drama based on the legend of Hua Mulan, who in a show of filial piety joins the army in her father's place to fight off invading nomads. Hailing traditional virtues of honour and valour, the film was an immediate success and has raised patriotic feelings throughout the country, along with an inevitable flood of popular comparisons between Hua Mulan and Soong Qingling."
chi_dom.9.a:0 "How exciting!"

chi_dom.10.t:0 "The Premiere of The Spring River Flows East"
chi_dom.10.d:0 "Directed by Cai Chusheng and Zheng Junli, The Spring River Flows East is a two part epic movie depicting the hardships of a poor working class couple in Zhejiang during the trials and tribulations of the National Revolution. Portraying the corruption that greed and power holds over the people, the movie's message has been interpreted by many as a direct attack upon the moderate parties. However, the film has been a smashing success at the box office as well as with the critics."
chi_dom.10.a:0 "I say, it's the stuff that dreams are made of!"

chi_dom.18.t:0 "Sun Fo Splits the Minquan Faction"
chi_dom.18.d1:0 "The first Party Congress of the KMT ended with the Minsheng Faction keeping its leadership. After the Congress, the Right-Wing of the Minquan Faction, led by Sun Fo, blamed the Left-Wing of the Minquan Faction, under Song’s leadership, for being too lax during the struggle for the KMT leadership. This led to the long brewing conflict between them finally breaking out. After a fall out with no results, Sun Fo and his followers became angry and left, then declared the establishment of the Minzu faction. It seems that as the Minsheng Faction strengthens their control of central power and the tutelage, the Minquan Faction’s chances of gaining power are growing slim."
chi_dom.18.d2:0 "The first Party Congress of KMT ended with the Minquan Faction overtaking the Minsheng Faction as leaders of the KMT. After the Congress, the Right-Wing of the Minquan Faction, led by Sun Fo, discussed with the Left-Wing of the Minquan Faction their desire to become their own individual faction. Although Song Qingling tries to persuade them to stay in Minquan Faction, Sun Fo and his followers have decided to leave. It seems that if the Minquan Faction calls for an election, Sun Fo and his followers will participate as an independent faction."

chi_dom.20.d:0 "We have a choice between two prominent members of the party to stand as the head of government. The first is the only living son of Chiang Kai-Shek, Chiang Ching-kuo who is already more than equipped to take on the job. The second is a newcomer Fang Yuxiang who is more left than Chiang Ching-Kuo due to her years of study in the Commune of France, if we wish to follow the Commune of France form government more closely she will be an excellent choice.

After bonding with him, Morris started working for the KMT, helping train troops until he was offered to become one of Sun Yat-Sens many bodyguards. He eventually got the name Two-Gun Cohen after one battle where he was nicked by a bullet and decided to always carry two guns with him. After going back to Canada due to the disastrous campaign of the Northern Expedition he has once again visited China offering the same protection that he gave Sun Yat-Sen."

chi_dom.22.d:0 "With the formation of the Mechanized Warfare Study Commission, a recent graduate from the prestigious Kriegschule in Munich has been recalled home: None other than Chiang Wei-kuo, the late Chiang Kai-shek's second son. From his time in Germany, he not only trained with Germany's elite Gebirgsjäger, but learned about the latest ideas and experiments of mechanized warfare as he became a tank commander. He will certainly prove instrumental in the development of our armoured forces."

chi_dom.26.t:0 "Our Offer has Been Accepted"

chi_dom.28.t:0 "A Mysterious Letter"
chi_dom.28.d:0 "An encrypted letter was uncovered by accident by a party member. The letter is hand written and discussed in length how the current state of the party is unstable and in need of dire reform. The letter also goes onto the talk about a potential change in management of the party. Due to the heavy encryption of both the source and the recipient we can't track the letter down to any one person so we will have to remain vigilant."
chi_dom.28.a:0 "Let's hope this was a prank..."

chi_dom.29.t:0 "The Source"
chi_dom.29.d:0 "If the letter wasn't unsettling enough, we’ve caught the person who was the source of the letter. Even under heavy interrogation the person was reluctant to even speak a word about the letter, which doesn't give any hope that it is a small matter. We have no choice but to continue the interrogation until the information is given to us. This could take some time."
chi_dom.29.a:0 "This has to be a small conspiracy, right?"

chi_dom.30.t:0 "An Innocent Meeting"
chi_dom.30.d:0 "There are many people sitting around a large circular table. Many appear to be officers both old and new from Whampoa Military Academy whilst some are radicals not found in any high up positions of the party. Our spy was unable to gather anything beyond that, but he has his suspicions that there is a more sinister purpose to this meeting."

chi_dom.31.t:0 "A Matter of State"
chi_dom.31.d:0 "The spy stayed a bit longer in the next weekly meeting of the group he has been informing us about and has come to us with urgent news. Like last time the conversation was the same until at a certain point all members of the meeting nodded slowly. After assuring each other that they were secure they began discussing in detail about the depth of the infiltration. As the discussion progressed the spy was alarmed when one officer had reportedly said that the plan will commence in less than a month. The spy had to hurry out of the building to avoid being spotted but this discussion was more than enough to incriminate those attending."
chi_dom.31.a:0 "Send a detachment of police to investigate."

chi_dom.32.t:0 "The Conclusion of the Investigation"
chi_dom.32.d:0 "The police who were sent to investigate the people attending the meeting have reported that nothing suspicions is going on and that the spy must have been lying. This is highly odd as he is one of our most trusted spies and would never lie to us, something must be going on here."
chi_dom.32.a:0 "What is going on!?"

chi_dom.33.t:0 "The plot is exposed"
chi_dom.33.d:0 "It seems like forever since we found that letter but after many days of work we have found out the person the letter was addressed to is none other than Dai Chunfeng!"
chi_dom.33.a:0 "This is a very serious matter, arrest him!"

chi_dom.34.t:0 "Dai Chunfeng Takes Control"
chi_dom.34.d:0 "The situation was far worse than we originally expected. Like the spy heard in the meeting the bureaucracy has been vastly infiltrated, with every element of it now loyal to Dai first and the party second. Whilst the reports are coming through the Spy knocks on the party leader’s door, after the door opens two soldiers are seen behind the spy and he whispers to us 'I am sorry'. With Dai's influence entrenched in every facet of life his coup has succeeded. "
chi_dom.34.a:0 "An unexpected turn of events."

chi_dom.35.t:0 "First National Elections"
chi_dom.35.d:0 "There have been many unelected leaders of the Kuomintang over the years, not even Sun was elected. They realised that the unstable position of the Kuomintang meant no elected leader would have the will nor the power to come out on top. Since Wang Jingwei rose up as an insurgent state we have evolved to a fully functioning democracy so it is only right that we hold elections. There are a few parties running such as the major Minsheng and Minquan but even parties like the Chinese Syndicalist Party and the Minzu are attempting to gain some support.

chi_dom.36.d:0 "Two times the Kuomintang have failed in establishing control over China, each time has been progressively worse. First the KMT lost the Northern Expedition, then they failed the revolt... now it is our turn to secure China. With Chen Mingshu and the potential for other leader of the KMT to remerge the future is bright. First however we must deal with the many problems that face Liangguang and then look outwards."

chi_dom.37.t:0 "Soong Qingling Arrives"
chi_dom.37.d:0 "The infamous Soong Qingling has arrived to make sure the our KMT are seen as more legitimate to the rest of china, and the world. With her in a position of power we could truly stand a chance at uniting China, for the Republic!"

chi_dom.38.t:0 "Wang Jingwei Arrives"
chi_dom.38.d:0 "The Hero of the KMT, Wang Jingwei has also arrived to make sure the KMT are seen as more legitimate to the rest of china, and the world. With his prominence in the politics of China we could truly stand a chance at uniting China, for the Republic!"
chi_dom.38.a:0 "A Toast to Wang."

chi_dom.39.t:0 "Soong and Chen Disagree"
chi_dom.39.d:0 "Chen and Soong whilst technically belong to a similar ideological party have various differences which are seriously disrupting the re-establishment of the KMT. Chen believes that the revolution must include elements of Chen Jiongmings government if it is too truly survive whereas Soong insists that the KMT should stay with the policies of the last two versions of the KMT. Whatever comes out of these talks it is clear one of the two will have to garner support to keep their position."
chi_dom.39.a:0 "We can only hope they can solve their differences."

chi_dom.40.t:0 "Unrest in Guangdong"
chi_dom.40.d:0 "Whilst the political side of Chens removal is solidly behind Chen... on paper, the peasants are rioting at the new change in government. Before when the KMT used Guangdong as staging ground for the Northern Expedition at least Jiongming was around to placate them but without him the stability of the province is deteriorating."
chi_dom.40.a:0 "We must fix this."

chi_dom.41.t:0 "Soong and Chen Debate Further"
chi_dom.41.d:0 "Chen and Soong have been subtly critical of each other since the beginning however the two are now openly discussing who should be in charge of the Kuomintang. It seems the facade of unity has been chucked out of the window and the race to become leader has begun. The comfort we can take out of this is that the other agreed to not be a threat should one of them come out on top."
chi_dom.41.a:0 "We will take what little good news we can get."

chi_dom.42.t:0 "Unrest in Guangxi"
chi_dom.42.d:0 "The warlords in Guangxi have finally been defeated however the remnants of their clique are causing trouble in the area. Whilst they are certainly without any meaningful leadership it is perhaps best to put them out of their misery."
chi_dom.42.a:0 "They will be dealt with."

chi_dom.43.t:0 "Peasants Flee from the Fujian Base Area"
chi_dom.43.d:0 "The battle between Soong and Chen seems to have distracted us from the larger issue, the huge refugee problem to the east. Under normal conditions this would be fine however the lack of control we have risks these peasants causing trouble, already some incidents have occurred at the border. We can only watch for the time being..."
chi_dom.43.a:0 "This must be kept under control."

chi_dom.44.t:0 "More Peasants Flee from the Fujian Base Area"
chi_dom.44.d:0 "The huge refugee problem to the east has grown significantly. Double the amount of refugees since the last report have made it into the province with some of these peasants causing more trouble than before, something must be done about this issue soon."
chi_dom.44.a:0 "Something must be done!"

chi_dom.45.t:0 "The Toughest Decision"
chi_dom.45.d:0 "Chen has been troubled by these refugees as he feels it was our obligation to protect them during the Fujian Government however he has also recognised the issue that we face with the large influx of crime. He has a choice between trying to broker a peace with the peasants or forcing them all back to the Fujian Zone."
chi_dom.45.a:0 "They have only caused trouble."
chi_dom.45.b:0 "We need to appeal to the populace here."

chi_dom.46.t:0 "The Leadership Crisis has Begun "
chi_dom.46.d:0 "Chen and Soong are now going head to head to try and become leader of the Kuomintang. They will be trying to garner enough support from the party to be elected to the role of President which will have the duty of overseeing the foundation of a KMT China."
chi_dom.46.a:0 "They have only caused trouble."

chi_dom.47.t:0 "Chen Makes a Statement"
chi_dom.47.d:0 "Chen Mingshu has finally spoken on the issue of his continued presidency, whilst he isn't fully the President of the Republic he has been overseeing the peaceful transition from Federalism. In his speech Chen also mentions how he is dedicated to making the KMT rule China due to the fact he restored them."
chi_dom.47.a:0 "He makes a good point!"

chi_dom.48.t:0 "Soong Qinglings Speech"
chi_dom.48.d:0 "Soong starts of her speech by reminding people that she was married to Sun Yat-Sen and that she was also dedicated uniting China. She also says that this means she is committed to Sun Yat-Sens Policies and that she will realise his vision for China."
chi_dom.48.a:0 "A good speech!"

chi_dom.49.t:0 "Election Results Incoming"
chi_dom.49.d:0 "On the eve of the election results we await the announcement of who will lead the KMT too greatness. People have been highly supportive of both due to each of their positions but at the end of the day only one will make it on top. Despite their differences Soong walked up to Chen shaking his hands and wishing him 'Good Luck' which he reciprocated. This is most likely to show the unity of the government but some speculate they both genuinely respect each other part to play in China."
chi_dom.49.a:0 "I just can't sleep."

chi_dom.50.t:0 "The President Announced"
chi_dom.50.d:0 "The results are in and with the fate of the KMT... and China in the hands of the result many are eager to hear who came out on top. People suggest Chen might have due to his determination too unite China whilst other people make a note that some party members look high upon Soong due to her relationship with the Father of China, one thing for sure is that the winner is..."

chi_dom.50.b:0 "Soong Qingling"

chi_cng.1.t:0 "Call to Convene The National Congress"
chi_cng.1.d:0 "Many prominent members of the party have convened to discuss all matters of the state and organise the Kuomintang into a fully fledged government. The foundation for the congress will be the 1924 National Congress which was set up to organise the party into an official government. Subjects varying from reflection of past events to the status of syndicalist elements in our party will be discussed in length."
chi_cng.1.a:0 "Excellent."

chi_cng.2.t:0 "KMT votes on adopting official history of the 1st Northern Expedition"
chi_cng.2.d:0 "After much build up the Revolutionary Army marched north against the Zhilli in an effort to unify the country... this failed. Many points have been brought up such as the KMT lacking the peoples support or intervention from foreign powers, specifically Germany. We should decide which of these arguments are more compelling to use as the root cause of the failure to unify the country."
chi_cng.2.a:0 "Imperialists and traitors."
chi_cng.2.b:0 "Lack of support from the population."

chi_cng.3.t:0 "The Question of Ethnic Autonomy"
chi_cng.3.d:0 "Much of China outside the 18 Provinces has effectively become independent, and there are many ethnic separatist movements. Our goal is to unite all the territory of the old Qing back into a single Chinese nation - would the adoption of federalized ethnic zones inside a greater China allow for the security and allegiance of non-Han peoples?"
chi_cng.3.a:0 "No. China must be truly unified."
chi_cng.3.b:0 "Yes. It is the best way to reunifying the country."

chi_cng.4.t:0 "The Question of Syndicalist Parties"
chi_cng.4.d:0 "The KMT's party program for developing China plans that only the KMT will be allowed to exist as a full political party for the period of Political Tutelage. As a precondition of Syndicalist aid, we have made exemptions for the Chinese Syndicalist Party and several other minor urban syndicalist groups. Should the Syndicalist parties be given an exception to the ban on public recruitment in the realm of organizing urban labour?"
chi_cng.4.a:0 "No. Tutelage must extend to labour relations."
chi_cng.4.b:0 "Yes. Chinese labour should be able to choose to join Syndicalist-aligned unions."

chi_cng.5.t:0 "Status of Whampoa Academy"
chi_cng.5.d:0 "The Whampoa Military Academy is long gone however many in our government and military wish to see it brought back, it is hard to disagree with this point as our army is woefully behind many of our competitors. If we bring it back we can begin to once again have a strong army which will make our victory over China all but assured. With all the put to rest we have two questions, do we either restore it as it was before or give it a modern touch as warfare has changed since the time of the expedition."
chi_cng.5.a:0 "We will simply restore the Academy."
chi_cng.5.b:0 "A new academy for a new China!"

chi_cng.6.t:0 "Direction of the NRA"
chi_cng.6.d:0 "With our consolidation over Southern China, several ideas of how to conduct warfare have emerged. Two ideas have emerged as most prominent, with the first being the possibility of using our vast manpower as our strength. This isn't particularly unique among the armies in China, however, there is nothing wrong with using a reliable method. The second idea is the modernisation of our armies, which will ensure that when it comes to fighting, our soldiers will be far superior compared to the enemy. What shall we go with?"

chi_cng.6.b:0 "Modernization is key to unifying China"

chi_cng.7.t:0 "A Reflection of Previous Leaders"
chi_cng.7.d:0 "We can all agree that both Sun Yat Sen and Chiang Kai-Shek did a lot for the KMT. Where it is up for interpretation is whether these figures were good for China. Of course Sun Yat-Sen had many amazing qualities however he seemed desperate to hold onto power, this could also be interpreted as him trying to make sure the KMT survives. Chiang Kai-Shek is up for debate as he did a lot for the military however he also oversaw the disaster of the Northern Expedition."
chi_cng.7.a:0 "They are both the Father and Son of China"
chi_cng.7.b:0 "Both were good for China but perhaps we could downplay how much"

chi_cng.8.t:0 "Report on the JiangFu Government"
chi_cng.8.d:0 "Song Qingling has been the acting governor of Fujian province and the JiangFu zone for much of the last ten years. Her administration has, through creating a form of locally-run one-party democracy, created an alternative vision for how the National Revolution can be done that opposes the top-down nature of the Wang Jingwei program. Minsheng faction members criticize the idea of the JiangFu program being expanded to all of China as being impractical, but its implementation has proven economically and militarily successful and very popular with Fujian province locals."
chi_cng.8.a:0 "Adopt a token resolution praising Song's administration."
chi_cng.8.b:0 "Officially recognize the JiangFu experiment as a success."

chi_cng.9.t:0 "Review of the War of Five Provinces"
chi_cng.9.d:0 "A review of the current status of the National Liberation Zone and its recent expansion out of JiangFu after the last campaign has been drafted by the NRA. The general consensus of all involved advises caution in moving north against the Zhili too soon. A majority of the NRA's old guard favors focusing on reunifying southern China before daring to cross the Huai, but the Young Guard and their allies in the civilian KMT such as Zhou Enlai advise an opportunistic stance towards an inevitable war between the Zhili clique and itself or Fengtian."
chi_cng.9.a:0 "Favor regional unification"
chi_cng.9.b:0 "Favor opportunism in the north."
chi_cng.9.c:0 "Don't interfere in the NRA's strategic planning."

chi_cng.10.d1:0 "After the series of debates during the Congress Wang Jingwei has secured his control over the Kuomintang and will now serve as the leader of the republic. He will begin to implement the many reforms that were proposed to modernise our nation into a force that can unify this broken country."
chi_cng.10.d2:0 "After the series of debates during the Congress the Minquan faction has secured a majority and have taken over the Kuomintang to serve as the leaders of the republic. We shall begin to implement the many reforms that were proposed to modernise our nation into a force that can unify this broken country."
chi_cng.10.a:0 "Chairman Wang’s policy is always right."

chi_cng.11.t:0 "Call to Convene The Second National Congress"
chi_cng.11.d:0 "With key cities such as Beijing and Nanjing under our control it is now time to convene a second congress and discuss new important issues. Many prominent members of the party have convened to discuss all matters of the state and organise the Kuomintang into the true power in China. Subjects such as our position in China and the fate of our wartime policies will be discussed in length."
chi_cng.11.a:0 "Excellent."

chi_cng.12.t:0 "The Question of Taxes"
chi_cng.12.d:0 "The KMT has imposed some fairly high taxes since the first congress despite promising not to. This was hidden by the fact the KMT wasn't in a good position at the time, now with our capture of both Nanjing and Beijing the people have seen that they are not necessary any more. We can either ease the taxes a little or keep them in place for the time being..."
chi_cng.12.a:0 "We are still in a dangerous position?"
chi_cng.12.b:0 "We must ease their burden."

chi_cng.13.t:0 "Formation of a Permanent Capital"
chi_cng.13.d:0 "With many key cities secured we plan a future event to discuss where the permanent capital of China should be. Many people brought this up as it is an issue of great contention with arguments to move the capital to the newly captured city of Beijing to even Wuhan, the birth of the revolution."
chi_cng.13.a:0 "We will certainly put some thought into this."

chi_cng.14.t:0 "The Reintegration of the North"
chi_cng.14.d:0 "The KMT's influence in the North of China has always been minimal so we must make an effort to bring the various warlords there under our control and perhaps give them a show of force. Some ministers brought up the possibility of securing parts of east Asia and even Russian territories, whilst they were laughed at the idea of securing foreign territories it might be vital to make sure imperialist influence doesn't spread to any further."
chi_cng.14.a:0 "The North must be pacified."

chi_cng.15.t:0 "End of the Congress"
chi_cng.15.d:0 "With the key cities of Beijing and Nanjing under our control we can now prove to the rest of the world that we are the legitimate government and that they should support us. Now with the Northern Expedition over it is at last our turn to play the role of Beijing Government."
chi_cng.15.a:0 "The Northern Expedition has been avenged."

chi_for.1.t:0 "Support from KMT Centre"
chi_for.1.d1:0 "The Kuomintang Central Committee in Fujian province has expressed its willingness to support us in fighting against those traitorous Old Gui clique. Although some of our generals and officials believe that accepting their assistance will make us gradually submit to them, for us, their support will indeed bring great help in the war against Ma Ji."
chi_for.1.d2:0 "The KMT Central Committee in Fujian region has unexpectedly showed their support for us against the Federalists and Merchants. Most oppose connecting with the left-wing KMT Central Committee with Wang Jingwei as its leader because they betrayed us critically during the Guangxi War. However, as we have to face the threat of Guangdong Clique as well,  it would be much easier for us to win the war if we accept this aid... temporarily."

Maybe the process of making this decision is tortuous or even arduous, but in the name of Revolution, nothing is insurmountable. And now, the good news has been spread among our soldiers and workers, which makes everyone working hard overtime and only wishing more goods could be delivered to our brothers in Liangguang safely."
chi_for.2.d2:0 "\"Unbelievable!\" is the only sound that remains after short silence and huge, violent burst of noise in Kuomintang Central Committee. No matter why, how could those Liangguang tsheh-laus decide to refuse our true kindness and not consider that this is about the revolution? Not only does this shock the Committee members, but it also ignites a huge wave of dissent in our population. Although there are voices demanding expulsion of the entirety of Liangguang Kuomintang, our leader said that Liangguang Kuomintang are still our brother in the revolution and the only reason that they refuse the support is because they don't want to increase the burden on the Central Committee."

The city is the historical capital of several dynasties, was the centre of the League of Eight Provinces, and the favoured permanent capital of many in the KMT. Longyan is small and isolated, which helped the insurgency survive, but now this fact doesn't help the KMT's civil and military administration. It may be prudent to move our government to Nanjing until our final capital is determined."

This extraordinary event even surprised the High Command and the Central Committee of Kuomintang. When questioned, the two Generals informed our men that upon learning there would be war between the Bhartiya Commune and Chinese forces, they decided to go into exile rather than fight against their own kind. Their patriotic story has earned them much sympathy amongst our own forces. Upon learning of the story, the Central Committee has approved the reinstatement of these two back to their previous roles, and they will be allowed to go back to the front to command, if given the final go ahead."

### Focus ###

CHI_expandthepowerofthezhongteju:0 "Expand the Power of the ZhongTeJu"
CHI_expandthepowerofthezhongteju_desc:0 "The severe threats that have threatened our government in the past few months have made it clear that the ZhongTeJu and the civil police need more power to deal with any state-destructive machinations by our enemies. We will now implement Chairman Dais plan, which he presented at the ZhongTeJu meeting."

CHI_startatruthandreconciliationcampaign:0 "Baihua Qifang"
CHI_startatruthandreconciliationcampaign_desc:0 "We will launch a national campaign called 'Baihua Qifang' (Hundred Flowers Movement) which encourages all citizens to openly criticize our government and make suggestions for improvement. Chairman Dai said that he and the party leadership are already 'very excited' about what proposals they will get from the population. The campaign is scheduled to run for six months, after which the results will be evaluated."

CHI_anewinterpretationofthethreeprinciples:0 "A new Interpretation of the Three Principles"
CHI_anewinterpretationofthethreeprinciples_desc:0 "Dr. Suns three principles have served us well in the past to create a better China, but their interpretation is simply out of date to continue to benefit us. The Kuomintang Central Committee will revise the meaning of the three principles so that we can build a modern and better China."

CHI_establishmentofreeducationcamps:0 "Establishment of 'Re-Education Camps'"
CHI_establishmentofreeducationcamps_desc:0 "There will always be people who don't want to take the easy way of submission and adaptation to the circumstances. We set up special 'Re-Education Camps' for these people, where they are taught correct thinking and good behavior."

CHI_daisruleoftheironfist:0 "Dai's Rule of the Iron Fist"
CHI_daisruleoftheironfist_desc:0 "Chairman Dai has accomplished what no one has done before him: He has fully united China under his rule of the Iron Fist! It is now clear to all citizens that without Chairman Dai there is no strong China! \nChairman Dai today! \nChairman Dai tomorrow! \nChairman Dai forever!"

CHI_chiangsnewnra:0 "Chiang's New NRA"
CHI_chiangsnewnra_desc:0 "The NRA is now only a shadow of itself after the coup. Many soldiers and officers no longer trust each other, which weakens our moral and operational ability. Generalissimo Chiang has ordered an extensive reform program to be implemented to restore the effectiveness of the NRA."

CHI_chiangsbennevolentdictatorship:0 "Chiang's Benevolent Rule"
CHI_chiangsbennevolentdictatorship_desc:0 "Generalissimo Chiang's renewed path to the top was long and difficult. He saved China from the brutal tyrant Dai Chunfeng just in time and the people are grateful for that. True democracy may still be far away, but Chiang's rule is not unjust, it's a progressive and benevolent one that can be described as tough but fair. Under his rule, China can become a stable place of progress and democracy in the future."

CHI_expandthenewlifemovement:0 "Expand the New Life Movement"
CHI_expandthenewlifemovement_desc:0 "The New Life Movement implemented under Dai Chunfeng was arguably one of the few good things he did during his reign. The success of the movement proves that we should continue to finance it to bring China further into the modern age."

CHI_aradicalchangeofcourse:0 "Birth of a New Regime"
CHI_aradicalchangeofcourse_desc:0 "To finally stabilize our government, we have to decide what to do with the remains of the radical ZhongTeJu members and what face we want to give our government. The Central Committee has developed several solutions to this problem that we can consider."

CHI_anintelligenceagencywithastate:0 "An Intelligence Agency with a State"
CHI_anintelligenceagencywithastate_desc:0 "Even if we keep the appearance of democracy on the outside, it is clear to almost everyone in the world that the decisions are no longer made by the chinese people, but by the ZhongTeJu Central Committee and Dai Chunfeng. No citizen or foreigner can do anything in China without the ZhongTeJu being aware of it. Abroad, our state is already referred to as 'An Intelligence Agency with a State', something that Chairman Dai amused took note of."

CHI_abolishthelegislativeyuan:0 "Abolish the Legislative Yuan"
CHI_abolishthelegislativeyuan_desc:0 "The Legislative Yuan is still a thorn in our side even after we took power. The little hope of 'democracy' and 'freedom' it embodies must come to an end!

chi_tot.1.t:0 "Chairman Dai announces a meeting of the ZhongTeJu leadership"
chi_tot.1.d:0 "Chairman Dai announced in a secret message to all senior ZhongTeJu officials that a leadership congress will be held in the capital in two weeks. At the conference, he wants to give new instructions to his subordinates and talk about other important topics. \n\nHowever, the letter also states that anyone who should not be present or lose a single word about what will be said at the conference will be executed immediately."
chi_tot.1.a:0 "Um, well, then we should rather accept Dai's friendly invitation pretty quickly..."

chi_tot.2.t:0 "ZhongTeJu Conference: Day 1"
chi_tot.2.d:0 "After all conference attendees arrived and took their seats, Chairman Dai stood up to deliver his opening speech: \n'My comrades, not too long ago we saved the state and the party from the total collapse that the previous, incompetent party leadership had endured through their erratic leadership. China must never come into such a situation again if we want that the party state can survive! \nTherefore, I hereby announce that the government will implement far-reaching reforms in the near future that will ensure that every citizen is fully committed to the state. We will achieve this by expanding the ZhongTeJu and giving the civil police more powers. \nThe goal must be that the party knows at all times where each citizen is and what he is doing at the moment. The details will be discussed later today.' \n\nDai paused for a moment and he began to grin in amusement, then he continued: \n\n'Unfortunately, not all of those present here will see our plan continue, some have stupidly allowed themselves outrageous comments against me and my government, which I consider to be opositional and counterrevolutionary thinking, which will be punished with full severity.' \n\nAfter Dai finished his speech, a dozen of the conference participants were roughly grabbed by the Chairman's bodyguards and dragged out of the room, while Dai comfortably drank a whiskey and talked to a few officers and party members. \n\nA short time later, a few shots were heard from outside, but nobody in the hall knowingly took note of it, because whoever should also anger the Chairman ends up like those poor bastards outside."
chi_tot.2.a:0 "Did anyone hear anything? No? Well! Let's have a whiskey with Chairman Dai!"

chi_tot.3.t:0 "ZhongTeJu Conference: Day 2 (Part 1)"
chi_tot.3.d:0 "The second day of the conference was actually quite normal compared to yesterday, but there was a certain tension among those present in the hall. Because everyone knew what happened yesterday and the Dai announced that he wanted to share top secret information with them today. Shortly after the lunch break, Chairman Dai spoke again: \n\n'My comrades, as I announced yesterday, it’s time to reveal the real reason why I have called this conference in the first place. Our whole operation of overthrowing the previous government was only possible because, in addition to infiltrating the bureaucracy through our ZhongTeJu, we had help with strategic planning and the elimination of the risk of a reaction from the NRA, namely through this familiar face! Come out of the shadow, Marshal Chiang!' \n\nAt that moment, behind the lectern at which Dai stands, a man in a black uniform, with sunglasses, a face completely scarred, and with the rank badge of a ZhongTeJu Marshal stepped out of the shadows. \nEven though it is not easy to see due to the many wounds, it is no doubt Chiang Kai-shek is now standing next to Dai Chunfeng. \nEveryone in the room was paralyzed with shock, because nobody could believe that Marshal Chiang, who died during the German intervention, should really be standing up there on the Podeum. \n\nChiang smiled and went to the lectern beside Dai: \n\n'Greetings to you all, my former friends and comrades, it's been a while since I saw the faces of some of you here for the last time. Some of you will probably be asking yourself: \nHow is that possible? Why is he still alive?"
chi_tot.3.a:0 "It's actually quite simple:"

chi_tot.4.t:0 "ZhongTeJu Conference: Day 2 (Part 2)"
chi_tot.4.d:0 "First the how: I owe it to my friend Dai Chunfeng that I can stand here in front of you today and nobody else. \nAnd now why: I didn't die during the intervention like the foreign press hastily announced, no, the assassins who were after me seriously wounded me and left me there to die, not knowing that I wasn’t dead. I somehow made it out of there, but had completely lost my memory. I no longer knew where I came from or who I was. I was so disfigured by my wounds on my face and whole body that no one recognized me whom I met while aimlessly roaming the country. \n\nA simple peasant family called Hu from Hunan took me in after they found me starving in a dirty ditch and took pity on me. They gave me food, a job in their fields and a place to sleep. The father of the family gave me the name Hu Changning because I couldn't remember my own. \nAfter that, five years went by until I was approached by a man in a hooded coat one day while I was doing my work in the field. He spoke to me and asked: 'Old friend, it is nice to see you again.' \n\nThat man was Dai Chunfeng. \n\n'He helped me regain my memory and secretly included me in the ranks of the ZhongTeJu. \nI have been hiding until today so that the disgusting Germans have no reason to invade China again. \nBut now that China has become a power to take on the western imperialists, Dai and I have decided that it is time to at least reveal to the people present here in this room, that I'm alive.' \n\nThe shock among the ZhongTeJu members continued as Chiang ended his speech and took a seat next to Dai. They still couldn’t believe what just happened. \n\nThe conference will continue tomorrow morning as everyone has to digest this overwhelming revelation first."
chi_tot.4.a:0 "What?! How did the Chairman manage to hide Chiang from us for so long?!"

chi_tot.5.t:0 "ZhongTeJu Conference: Day 3"
chi_tot.5.d:0 "After yesterday's shock, the third day of the conference began. Chiang Kai-shek was now one of the people in the room, sitting at the front of the same table as Chairman Dai. \n\nIn a five-hour speech, the chairman outlined his plan for permanent pacification across China. He said that it had been tolerated for far too long that many of our former enemies are still at large or in exile. In his view, China cannot be safe from these people's destructive ideas until they are in custody. Because if these people somehow manage to regain influence and incite people against our rule, our country will again face massive unrest. That is why the ZhongTeJu and the national civil police are given extensive powers by the Kuomintang Central Committee to maintain order in the country. \n\nDai also ordered that every senior member and leader of the federalists, the Fengtian government, the Qing Empire, the Zhili clique, influential warlords with secessionist ambitions, the Yiguandao cult, and the left and right Kuomintang be arrested immediately . To be on the safe side, these people's families are also detained for the time being until we have decided what to do with them. \n\nAfter the rest of the speakers had also finished their lectures, the conference was closed by Chairman Dai shortly before midnight. In his closing remarks he reminded everyone present that he expected absolute silence about everything discussed here and that all of his instructions were to be implemented immediately."
chi_tot.5.a:0 "Applause for the party and Chairman Dai!"

chi_tot.6.t:0 "NRA Coup: Attack on the Capital!"
chi_tot.6.d:0 "The streets of the capital were almost deserted, only a few people could be seen running across the streets. \n\nChairman Dai yesterday announced martial law for the entire city and imposed a curfew. And on the city's main squares and main streets, the NRA and ZhongTeJu have set up barricades and checkpoints as if they were expecting an attack. \n\nThe tension in the whole city had been unbearable all day and the soldiers looked extremely nervous. \n\nThen in the early afternoon, hell broke out over the city. At some checkpoints on the outskirts of the city, the NRA soldiers started shooting ZhongTeJu troops and opening the barricades. Whereupon further NRA units advanced towards the city center, which were strategically positioned in the villages and forests around the city. \n\nHowever, the ZhongTeJu and loyal NRA units quickly reorganized and intercepted the rebel NRA units only a few hundred meters later and embroiled them in violent battles. \n\nAccording to reports, Chiang Kai-shek was seen in one of the attacking armored vehicles as they set up their command post in a school building."
chi_tot.6.a:0 "And so the fight for the capital begins"

chi_tot.7.t:0 "NRA Coup: Fight for the Capital's Airport!"
chi_tot.7.d:0 "After the putschists were able to advance into the city through the betrayal of some NRA units on the outskirts of the city, our scouts identified their first target: \n\nThe putschists are advancing towards the airport to cut off our air supply! Some loyal troops have already been stationed there to ward off the attack. A little later the attackers arrived and started firing at our troops. \n\nAfter a few hours of fierce fighting, a message came in from one of our forward command posts that said:"
chi_tot.7.a:0 "The loyal troops repelled the attackers and defended the airport!"
chi_tot.7.b:0 "The putschists smashed our defense and took the airport!"

chi_tot.8.t:0 "NRA Coup: Siege of the Capital's Central Station!"
chi_tot.8.d:0 "After the battle for the airport, the putschists are now moving towards the central station to cut us off completely from any supply! \n\nOur soldiers have already dug trenches there and stationed machine guns to ward off possible attacks. \nFortunately, the number of attackers was less than that of our defenders and the two units facing each other are about the same strength, our loyal troops have the manpower advantage, but our opponents use tanks, it remained to be seen who was stronger. \n\nIn the course of the battle it became clear after a few hours who had the upper hand:"
chi_tot.8.a:0 "The loyal troops successfully defended the Central Station!"
chi_tot.8.b:0 "The Central Station falls into the hands of the putschists!"

chi_tot.9.t:0 "NRA Coup: Fight for the KMT Central Committee building!"
chi_tot.9.d:0 "Even before the battle for Central Station was over, the coup leaders launched a frontal attack on the Kuomitang Central Committee building. \n\nBy conquering the building, the putschists apparently wanted to reckon the morale of our defending troops so that they could advance into the city more easily. \n\nThe fighting lasted most of the day, but shortly before sunset it became clear that:"
chi_tot.9.a:0 "The loyal troops defended the Central Committee building!"
chi_tot.9.b:0 "The putschists conquered the Central Committee building!"

chi_tot.10.t:0 "NRA Coup: Attack on the Capital Garrison!"
chi_tot.10.d:0 "Bad news! \n\nWhile we paid attention to the defense of the Central Committee, a unit of the putschists managed to advance to the garrison of the capital and start an attack on it! \n\nWe had to withdraw troops from the surrounding fronts to defend the Granision. Unfortunately, the enemy managed to penetrate the complex's forecourt before our troops could counterattack! \n\nEven after several hours of fighting, shots were still heard from the building complex and it was difficult to get information about the status of the troops, but now we are certain that:"
chi_tot.10.a:0 "The Garrison was successfully defended by the loyal troops!"
chi_tot.10.b:0 "The Garrison and the Equipment there fell into the hands of the putschists!"

chi_tot.11.t:0 "NRA Coup: Siege of ZhongTeJu Headquarters!"
chi_tot.11.d:0 "It came as it had to come: the fighting in the city had now reached the ZhongTeJu headquarters, where Dai Chunfeng was staying and organizing the city's defense. \n\nThe main forces of the two parties to the conflict now faced each other in the streets and squares around the building and fought a bitter battle. No one on both sides was willing to back down now because everyone was aware of the importance of the building. If ZhongTeJu headquarters falls, it would put Dai Chunfeng in a pretty bad position, but if the attack is repelled, the attackers' main forces would be severely weakened. \n\nShortly before midnight, one side finally managed to strike the decisive blow:"
chi_tot.11.a:0 "The loyal troops defended the building and are now preparing to counterattack!"
chi_tot.11.b:0 "Dai Chunfeng fled the building with his retreating loyal troops to reorganize!"

chi_tot.12.t:0 "The dust begins to settle..."
chi_tot.12.d:0 "Now that only a few small battles are taking place in the entire city area and the fire brigade has started to put out the fires in the buildings, a victorious side has now emerged as the dust begins to settle. \n\nAfter evaluating several reports, it can be said that..."
chi_tot.12.a:0 "...the Coup was..."

chi_tot.13.t.dai:0 "...a failure! And Chiang Kai-shek has been arrested!"
chi_tot.13.t.kai_shek:0 "...a success! And Dai Chunfeng has been arrested!"
chi_tot.13.d.dai:0 "Outstanding work! Execute all these traitors on the spot! But bring Chiang directly to the Chairman, he wants to personally execute him!\n\nAnd congratulations to our loyal soldiers! Long live the party! Long live the Chairman!"
chi_tot.13.d.kai_shek:0 "Cheers to our success! Arrest all followers of Dai's government and disarm the NRA units that fought for him! Make sure Dai Chunfeng is safely housed in a cell until we can bring him to court!"
chi_tot.13.a:0 "Ah, sweet victory! Long live the Chairman!"
chi_tot.13.b:0 "The day is ours! Long live the Generalissimo!"

chi_tot.14.t:0 "Dai Chunfeng consolidates his power!"
chi_tot.14.d:0 "Dai was sitting in a meeting room with some of his closest allies, reflecting on the coup a few days ago, and was certain that the past few days were perhaps the greatest and probably the final threat to his rule over China. Then he spoke: \n'You will probably wonder why I called you here, gentlemen. And you may be wondering why I am not celebrating the victory over Chiang's coup. But if you thought about it, it is actually quite simple: such a one Treachery like that of Chiang, a man I saved and trusted, cannot have been planned without help from the inside! Chiang died yesterday by my hand, but that's not the end of it! There are people sitting at this table , who have rather stuffed their pockets and celebrated large parties in the past few years instead of doing their job properly!' \nDai hit the table with full force. \n 'Please tell me how it can be that military units like Chiang's can be strategically positioned around and in the capital without being noticed!' \nEveryone at the table was silent. \nWell, I have found some evidence that some of you have been offered bribes and a safe escape from China by the coup leaders if you in return make me fall into the hands of Chiang! Would anyone like to contradict me?' \nSome of the attendees were visibly nervous when Dai paused to look around. \nThen Dai snapped his finger and his guards pulled out their guns and shot everyone in the room except a general and two senior ZhongTeJu administrators. Then Dai spoke again: 'I hope the three of you now understand the terrible consequences of disobedience. You now have a choice, you will either continue to serve me as a loyal subordinate, or I will kill and replace you as well. And so that it is clear: China is mine and only mine and everyone who wants to contest it will end up like the dead traitors here in the room!'"
chi_tot.14.a:0 "Everyone is happy to accept Dais's kind offer! Long live the Chairman!"

chi_tot.15.t:0 "Generalissimo Chiang's first public appearance!"
chi_tot.15.d:0 "Thousands of people had gathered in front of the Kuomintang Central Committee building this morning because the new Chairman wanted to address the nation. None of the audience knew exactly who this new chairman actually was. It was only a few days since Dai Chunfeng was arrested and the NRA coup was over, and order had not yet been fully restored in and around the capital. Still everyone was excited to find out who had defied and overthrown the tyrant Dai. \nAfter the square and the street in front of the Central Committee were almost overcrowded, a person finally stepped onto the balcony of the building. People were a little shocked when they saw that it was a terribly disfigured man in uniform who was now standing up there. Then he started to speak and the voice sounded strangely familiar: \n'I greet you warmly, ladies and gentlemen! Thank you for showing up here today, despite the difficult situation! As you have probably already learned, Dai Chunfeng and his followers were arrested for their crimes against the Chinese people and I was elected new Chairman.' \nBy now, pretty much everyone had realized that the man on the balcony was none other than the believed dead Chiang Kai-shek! \n'I understand your shocking that I suddenly reappear, even though everyone thought I was killed during the German intervention. But I can assure you that I was never killed, I had only completely lost my memory. I don't want to lengthen this speech unnecessarily today and therefore I have only one request to all of you: Please help me and the party to lead China out of this dark, difficult time by keeping everyone calm and helping with the reconstruction. Trust the government and give us some time, we will make sure that every citizen can live safely and freely! A new democratization will take place as soon as China is stable again! Thank you for your attention!'"
chi_tot.15.a:0 "The... the Generalissimo lives?!"

chi_tot.16.t:0 "Replacement of the Legislative Yuan"
chi_tot.16.d:0 "The seats in the Legislative Yuan, the parliament of the Chinese National State, have now largely been filled with our loyal followers and put on government line, but there are still some politicians from other KMT factions who are aggressively opposing our government there. Even if these politicians no longer have political power, their words still reach our people. We cannot tolerate this any longer! For this reason, the Chairman of the Legislative Yuan proposed a bill that would combine the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan and the Kuomintang Central Committee to save costs and personnel. This new body will then become known as the Supreme National Assembly and will have 3,000 seats. It will manage both the executive and the legislature under the direct leadership of the President, who is also the Chairman of the KMT and head of ZhongTeJu. Opposition politicians condemned this proposal as dictatorial and autocratic and that it was only an attempt to destroy democracy and centralize power on Dai Chunfeng. They protested until just before the vote, but it didn't help them. The law was adopted by an absolute majority of the votes of the members of the now abolished Legislative Yuan. The critical politicians have thus finally lost their seats and their remaining influence, since the members of the Supreme National Assembly can only be appointed on the proposal of the Examination Yuan and the President himself."
chi_tot.16.a:0 "The Supreme National Assembly brings stability!"

chi_tot.17.t:0 "The Hundred Flowers Campaign"
chi_tot.17.d:0 "As discussed in advance by the Central Committee, the Hundred Flowers Movement is being launched today. For the duration of the campaign, all citizens of the country can send their criticism or suggestions for improvement directly to the government by sending a letter with name and address to the President's office. After half a year, all letters sent should then be evaluated and then a plan drawn up to implement the best ideas. \n\nChairman Dai just remarked again that it is really important that everyone who writes a letter should give their exact address so that it will be easier to find and reward the citizens if one of their ideas is implemented! \n\nMany intellectuals and critics, who have so far been hiding out of fear, welcome the campaign and agreed to participate in it. Others sense a deadly trap and call on their colleagues to be careful! What a nonsense! \n\nChairman Dai also said at the end of the campaign opening ceremony: 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend!'"
chi_tot.17.a:0 "Please write a lot of letters! We 'really' want to hear the opinion of the people!"

chi_tot.18.t:0 "The Chinese Surveillance State"
chi_tot.18.d:0 "Chairman Dai has done what no one in China's modern history has done before: he has united China under the banner of a single central government. But he is not yet satisfied with the success. \n\nf we have learned one thing from the events of the past few months, it is that we cannot trust our citizens. \nWe can no longer tolerate our citizens putting their so-called 'personal freedom' or their 'families' above the interests of the state, the party and the chairman. All citizens must understand that their lives now belong to the state. \n\nFor this reason, Chairman Dai has been able to extend the state of emergency by decree, abolish all citizens and human rights and have ordered the ZhongTeJu and the police to take even harder action against our enemies. The measures we have already taken may be extremely harsh, but as we have seen during the Hundred Flowers Movement, it has not been enough to make all critics tremble with fear and finally silence them. Therefore, from now on, all citizens will be divided into categories and evaluated using a points system. All who have a high score and are loyal can live a good life, but all those who accumulate minus points will be 'sorted out' for the good of all. Our country will only be absolutely perfect if the state, the people and the party act as one. \n\n\nA new morning dawns for China, but this morning does not belong to the Chinese people, it belongs solely to Chairman Dai."
chi_tot.18.a:0 "The future belongs only to those who have fought hard for it! Long live the Chairman!"

chi_tot.19.t:0 "The Fate of Dai Chunfeng"
chi_tot.19.d:0 "'China has regained its freedom! Down with the traitor Dai! ' These were the words on the front page of many major daily newspapers that have resumed their work. \n\nThe coup is not too long ago, but the people are already in a spirit of optimism because they have confidence again and the tyrant Dai has been deposed. \n\nAt the moment, Dai Chunfeng is sitting in a high security cell waiting for his execution. The judgment was already foreseeable in the eyes of many, because treason is almost always punished with death by the Supreme Military Court. \n\nThe moment of his execution had come a few days after the verdict. Dai and a few of his most loyal followers, who were also sentenced to death, were taken to the gallows, where they were hanged shortly afterwards. The court denied the criminals the right to have final words before the execution. \n\nThis is how the dark chapter of Dai Chunfeng's tyrannical dictatorship ends. Now the Chinese people under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek and the NRA can take a new path to a better future. Chiang has announced that he will temporarily lead a military government and appoint a new interim government in a few months."
chi_tot.19.a:0 "China can breathe again and celebrate its new freedom!"

chi_tot.20.t:0 "Generalissimo Chiang forms a new government!"
chi_tot.20.d:0 "As announced shortly after taking office, Chiang Kai-shek will appoint a new interim government today. \nThe Generalissimo has several options available: \n\nHe could ask the §CMinzu Faction of the Kuomintang§!, who survived Dais' wave of cleansing, to work with the §RNRA§! to form a more §Cdemocratic interim government§! until an election for a new Legislative Yuan can be held. \n\nAlternatively, he could expand the §RNRA military government§! and completely dissolve the purged remains of §RZhongTeJu§!, which have so far supported the government until he believes China is ready for §Crenewed democratization§!, which is sure to be received with some §Rsuspicion by the people§!. \n\nOn the other hand, many of Chiangs §Oinfluential advisors§! urge that we should continue to maintain the current state of transition until the situation calms down, which could have §Rfatal consequences§! for our government if something should happen in the meantime."

Truly a success story that is second to none! \n\nBut then Dai Chunfeng's coup came against Wang Jingwei's democratically elected government, which created chaos in the country. It was only through the strength of our citizens and our NRA's loyalty to the constitution that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek succeeded in overthrowing the tyrant Dai and restoring order. Chiang would like to deliver a speech to Nation today announcing the new course for China: \n\n'My friends! I want to thank you all for your hard work in the past months, without your help it wouldn't have been possible to stabilize the country again! I can't deny that at first I wasn't particularly happy about the dominance of the left wing of the KMT in the country and that the right wing was completely wiped out by Dai Chunfeng, but in recent years I have become a man capable of compromising! Our country is different today than it was in 1925, today we stand together with a united and upright spirit! Let's build a better China together! I hereby announce the first free elections for the Legislative Yuan! My allegiance was to the Republic, to democracy! Thank you!'"

chi_tot.22.d:0 "This morning the Generalissimo announced that he was firing some of his advisors! He said that we cannot tolerate that China's stability will be jeopardized by the hesitation of some incompetent officials who only want to expand their own power. For this reason, he issued a decree authorizing the CC-Clique, an association of his closest friends and supporters, to form a transitional government."

chi_tot_ztj_murders.1.d:0 "Today, the first wave of political prisoners and their families have arrived in state prisons across the country, where they have been locked in their cells. The majority of our enemies were caught by the police and secret service when they were preparing to flee China. Most of them complied with their fate, but there were also some who preferred to commit suicide rather than to be captured. \n\nThe most prominent among them is the former Chairman Wang Jingwei: \nWhen the ZhongTeJu Officers entered Wang's office in his home to arrest him, a terrible picture emerged: \n\nWang Jingwei was crying at his desk, holding a pistol in his hand, on the floor the bodies of his wife and children, all with a bullet wound in their heads.\n\nWhen he saw the officers, he said to them: \n'You bastards will never be able to harm me or my family, I have protected them from the cruel torment that will await us in captivity! I refuse to take part in Dai's sick game somehow making political capital out of us!' \n\nAfter these words, he pointed the gun at his head and pulled the trigger. \n\nThen there was silence. \n\nThe officers were speechless and at first didn't know what to do, but then they decided to take the bodies to their bedrooms and burn the house and put the guilt for the Wang family's death on the fire."

The Central Committee must act now to prevent the danger of a new civil war! The common people must not question us, they must do and believe exactly what we tell them!

You must read this report immediately! Something terrible is going on in our prisons!' \n\nChiang carefully read the report, which said that the ZhongTeJu is no longer just executing political prisoners, but is now mass murdering their families! \nYesterday, Chen Jiongming and other leaders of the federalists were first executed, then their families were murdered! \nThis text apparently only found its way onto his table because the ZhongTeJu requested trucks from the NRA to remove the bodies and one of the drivers had a conscience and informed the military secret service that they were carrying enormous amounts of bodies of women and children out of the prisons . \nChiang was disgusted and shocked by what he had just read and turned to his adjutant: \n\n'Lieutenant, arrange a meeting with Chairman Dai immediately! I need to find out if he knows that his ZhongTeJu is massacring these innocent people in prisons!' \n\n'Yes! I will arrange it immediately, sir!'"

And not just the prisoners, but also their families! How can you explain that to me? Do you know of this cruel hideousness?' \n\nDai's face instantly darkened from a friendly smile to an angry face. \n\nDai: 'This is not something that is relevant to you in any way, is that clear? You ask if I know about it? I ordered it myself! How else can I stabilize China and secure our power if my enemies and their dirty clans are allowed to run around alive? If I don't remove the entire root, weeds will sprout again in the same place! This is the only way we can ensure prosperity and progress!' \n\nChiang: 'Have you gone completely insane? Punishing our enemies with the full rigor of the law is one thing, but we can't just murder innocent women and children because you believe your interests are at risk! We...' \n\nDai: 'YOU DARE TO TALK TO ME THIS WAY! Never forget that it was me who found you there in that dirty field and it was me who helped you get your memories back! And now you dare to stab me in the back? Remember where your place is and immediately forget everything you just told me!' \n\nChiang: 'I'm sorry, but I cannot overlook the fact that you obviously have no interest in doing good for China with your position, you are only interested in your personal power expansion! And in order to achieve your goal you even walk over the bodies of innocent women and children! I will never forget what you did for me, but this is going way too far!'"

I'm almost proud of you, that's exactly what I would have done in your situation! I would say we are currently in a stalemate.' \n\nChiang: 'I would say that too' \n\nDai: 'I'm sorry, but I still have other important appointments today, I think we need to clarify that later, so we won't be able to resolve our dispute now.

chi_tot_flavour.1.d:0 "Our efforts to make the New Life movement a success are finally bearing fruit: \n\nThis morning we received a telegram from the newly founded central committee of the so-called 'National Revolutionary Teachers' Association' (NRTA). They congratulate us on our righteous efforts to make China a modern state that can compete with the West, and they would be happy to help us. In their message, they suggest that we make them the official umbrella organization of all teachers in China under their chairman, a simple teacher from Hunan Province called Mao Zedong. \n\nIn return, they promise us that all teachers at all schools across the country will fully represent our ideals and pass them on to the next generation so that our children can fully understand Sun Yat-sen's ideas and become better people and successful adults."
chi_tot_flavour.1.a:0 "An excellent suggestion! Invite Mao to a meeting so we can discuss that!"
chi_tot_flavour.1.b:0 "What a nonsense! What credible references can this 'Chairman Mao' show us?"

chi_tot_flavour.2.t:0 "Foundation of the National Revolutionary Boy Scouts"
chi_tot_flavour.2.d:0 "Just a few months after the founding of the NRTA, its efforts are already having a positive effect on our education system, now Chairman Mao approached our government with another proposal: The founding of National Revolutionary Boy Scouts (NRBS), modeled on the United States' Boy Scouts but with Chinese characteristics. \n\nWith the help of the NRBS, our students will be taught many useful manual skills and the value of teamwork and friendship so that they can learn how to behave as a loyal and responsible citizen of the Republic of China. \n\nThis proposal is very similar to an idea that has been under discussion within our government for a while now, but it could be even more effective than ours through close cooperation with the NRTA leadership."
chi_tot_flavour.2.a:0 "That is a very good idea! Let's contact the NRTA!"
chi_tot_flavour.2.b:0 "Mao should rather concentrate on his lessons!"

chi_tot_flavour.3.t:0 "Foundation of the National Revolutionary Youth Summer Camps"
chi_tot_flavour.3.d:0 "Chairman Mao and the NRTA presented our government with another great idea that we could use to better support our students. \n\nThey proposed the establishment of National Revolutionary Youth Summer Camps, where our students can spend their holidays meaningfully by playing sports together, singing patriotic songs, learning useful skills for life, or strengthening group cohesion. \n\nAccording to the NRTA, this would not only benefit our students, but ensure that the state later has capable, useful adults who conscientiously live their lives and enjoy their work. \n\nBut now we have to ask ourselves whether we want to continue to provide money for the NRTA projects. Their efforts in all honor, but we cannot deny that their influence is growing faster and faster ..."

chi_tot_flavour.4.d:0 "After all previous projects that were planned and implemented by the NRTA were each a complete success, the government decided to commission them with the complete revision of our current education system. \n\nAfter a few weeks, the final plan was presented to us personally by Chairman Mao: \nIt provides that we should implement ideas already developed in our country by our teachers, but also adapt the best of the best of the education systems in western countries and Japan to ensure that the reform can be a complete success. Mao gave the plan the name: "The Great Education Leap Forward". \n\nMao also said that in order to implement all of this, the NRTA needs the full cooperation of the Ministry of Education, as well as an expansion of its powers. Many in our government support the NRTA's plan, but there are also voices warning that the NRTA, and especially Mao, shouldn't be given more influence in our government because the many projects are already consuming enormous amounts of money. Therefore, they suggest that we should replace Mao with someone less ambitious as the chairman of the NRTA and that we have to significantly reduce the high expenses."

chi_tot_flavour.5.d:0 "After the success of the NRTA and Chairman Mao in improving and modernizing our education system became more and more noticeable in the country, Generalissimo Chiang decided to restructure his cabinet and to appoint Chairman Mao as the new Minister of Education. \n\nIn his speech, Chiang stated that Mao was a true Chinese patriot who, through his hard work, made China's education system competitive with those of the West and Japan in just a few years. And he says it fills him with pride and trust to see that he even works on holidays to improve the educational standard of the people. And projects that would have taken dozens of years before can now be carried out in just a few years under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao."

He was angry that Dai had kept it secret all the time, that he still had a family, and had even actively prevented him from ever remembering it. \nAfter talking for more hours, Chiang decided that they should continue meeting in the coming weeks to help him remember everything that had happened in the past."
chi_tot_flavour.6.a:0 "I'm pleased that the Generalissimo is reunited with his family!"

chi_tot_flavour.7.t:0 "A reunited family"

To make up for it, he asked the two of them if they could help him rebuild China and free it from Dais dark shadow. \nThe two agreed to continue supporting their father. Together they will create a better country for the people."

The organizers are confident that there will be many more letters because 'surprisingly' the citizens have a lot to tell us, which they think is going wrong in the country. \n\nChairman Dai has announced that he is 'very satisfied and extremely happy' with the active participation of so many 'valuable citizens' and also hopes that many more people will turn to him with their thoughts in confidence!"

chi_tot_flavour.9.d:0 "Today the organizers presented us with the final report of the Hundred Flowers movement: \nOver a period of six months, a total of 1,162,589 citizens sent us a letter with criticism or suggestions for improvement. Among them were intellectuals, simple farmers and fishermen, factory workers and of course also politicians who had hoped to gain prominence and influence again. \n\nThey will all notice that they were fatally wrong. \n\nShortly after the report was evaluated, people across the country who insulted us with their unjustified, outrageous criticism were either shot immediately by the ZhongTeJu, the national Police, or extradited to lynch mobs to amuse our loyal followers, who then brutally murdered these traitors . \n\nThe streets of the country are colored deep red by the huge amount of blood that was shed today, but now even the last traitors in our country should finally understand that we will not stop until they are all dead. All in all, one can say that the movement was a complete success for our side, we managed to lure our enemies out of the reserve by clever action in order to destroy them. \n\nNow China is finally free from selfishness and betrayal by dissatisfied people. Everyone in the country now serves only one purpose, the one goal of making China the greatest nation in the world, and above all serving President Dai, our great Supreme Leader!"

The Minzu Faction of the KMT advocates democratization, but is against allowing other parties besides the KMT in the near future and hehemently refuses to support the Syndicalist Party or the European Syndicalists. In this election, however, they also support Chiang Kai-shek as the top candidate for the office of chairman of the KMT. \n\nThen there is the §OCentral Club Clique§!, an alliance of supporters of the former right-wing KMT, as well as close friends and loyal supporters of Generalissimo Chiang, most notably the brothers Chen Lifu and Chen Goufu, who lead the Clique alongside Chiang. \n\nThe other factions, §TMinquan§! and §RMinsheng§!, are still in a leadership crisis after the tragic deaths of Song Qingling and Wang Jingwei and therefore have no significant chances of winning a majority in this election. \n\nNow everyone was eagerly waiting for all the votes to be counted and the winner is:"

Fang Junying has shaped the faction in recent years along the lines of Song Qinlingss ideas and has advocated that the KMT should allow more parties in the future and work more closely with the Chinese Syndicalist Party and the Syndicalists in the rest of the world. \n\nIn contrast, Wang Jingweis longtime follower, Chen Gongbo, has asserted himself in the Minsheng Faction and is now leading it. He reaffirmed the KMT's claim to leadership across China and considers it dangerous to allow other parties, and supports continued tutelage of the people. He also advocates that China itself should take an active leadership role in the world instead of becoming a lap dog of the Europeans. \n\nThe Minzu Faction has announced that they want to run this election with their leader Li Liejun as their own candidate because they disagreed with some of Chiang's decisions in the past legislative period and therefore rule out further cooperation with him. \n\nAnd, as expected, the CC-Clique has announced that it will run again with Chiang Kai-shek as their top candidate after 'the Minzu Faction has foolishly insulted him and the other two factions cannot be expected to do any decent government work,' as Chen Lifu said. \n\nNow everyone was eagerly waiting for all the votes to be counted and the winner is:"
