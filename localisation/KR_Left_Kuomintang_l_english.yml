POLITICS_CHI_SONG_QINGLING_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! January 27th, 1893, in Shanghai, Shanghai International Settlement\n§YPolitical Career:§! A rebel from her youth, Song Qingling explicitly challenged her parents' opposition to her marriage to the late and honourable Dr. Sun Yat-sen, going as far as to run away from home to elope with the revolutionary statesman. Western-educated, fluent in English and Chinese, graceful, elegant, and charitable - she demonstrated her utmost loyalty to the revolutionary cause when she told Sun to flee ahead of the warlord Chen Jiongming's bombardment, despite reportedly suffering a miscarriage and never being able to bear children again.\n\nLoyal to his side, she was with Sun when he agreed to work with the Third Internationale and was present at his deathbed when his final will was read aloud. And then came the Northern Expedition, in which she participated, untouchable and unchallenged by anyone within the Kuomintang due to her status as the widow of the great Dr. Sun. But when the expedition failed, she refused to see it as the revolution's failure. Instead, she and other leftist Kuomintang generals fled to the MinGan Insurgent Zone, where she spent her time travelling between the insurgent zone and Shanghai to secure aid and support for the guerrilla war against the despicable Zhili warlords.\n\nServing alongside her had been none other than her close friend - Deng Yanda. The two had been together since the halcyon days of the Guangzhou Revolutionary Government and found themselves united, a brother and a sister in the revolutionary struggle. Together they formed the Provisional Action Committee, with the belief that it must be up to them to fully realise the dream of the late Dr. Sun.\n\nAt last, however, she finds herself merely more than the figurehead of the MinGan Zone... no, she has ascended to the Chairwoman of the Kuomintang. Now, she commands not merely the mantle of the Chinese Revolution but the revolution for all oppressed peoples worldwide - the promise and dream of her late husband may soon finally become a reality."

POLITICS_CHI_WANG_JINGWEI_DESC: "§YLeader Description§!\n§YBorn:§! May 4th, 1883, in Sanshui, Guangdong Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! In his youth, Wang Jingwei was enamoured with the lives of Saigo Takamori and Katsu Kaishu, seeing them as model men who transformed Japan from a backwater into an industrial nation. How can it be that China is so stagnant, he wondered - turning to the works of Liang Qichao and Sun Yat-sen. In the latter, he saw a beloved mentor, and in Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui, he exploded into national prominence when he attempted to assassinate the Zaifeng regent (father of Emperor Puyi) despite his failure and imprisonment.\n\nWhen the Xinhai Revolution broke out, Wang was freed, but he refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the disillusioned Sun, who had found himself sidelined by national politics and the warlords. He instead travelled to France but returned shortly after Sun's triumphant return to Guangzhou in 1921 to participate in the newly founded Kuomintang's revolutionary government. Wang was present at the party's reorganisation in 1924, and slowly began to represent the party's growing leftist wing, although he hardly fancied himself as a socialist ideologue. When Sun died in 1925, Wang was present on his deathbed and helped write his will.\n\nThe triumvirate of Hu Hanmin, Chiang Kai-shek, and Wang Jingwei quickly became one of the Kuomintang's most contested and bitter power struggles. Wang emerged the victor following Hu Hanmin's death in 1925 and Chiang Kai-shek's assassination following the failure of the Northern Expedition, but the collapse of the expedition forced him and his political allies to flee to Europe in the hopes of one day returning to carry out Sun's revolution. In exile, he has consolidated his position as the leader of the Kuomintang's Central Committee, far and often distant from the MinGan insurgency on the mainland.\n\nAt last, he has returned and claimed his place as Chairman of the Kuomintang, leader of the Chinese revolution. With a large cadre of loyal supporters, the backing of the Internationale and other allies, Wang confidently strides forward as Dr. Sun's rightful successor.§!"

CHI_sun_fo_bio: "Sun Fo is the only son of Sun Yat-sen and was sent by the late revolutionary to Honolulu to be raised in safety by his uncle. There he received a mixed traditional and modern education, becoming a Columbia-educated scholar and writer. His father frequently sent him books to read, but never any by Marx and Engels, something he believed to be evidence that his father was not a Marxist.\n\nHe returned to become his father's secretary. This allowed him to become an expert in his father's writings - a means of connecting with his distant parent. In 1920 he was appointed Mayor of Guangzhou and, despite his youth, was proficient as an administrator - writing a 57 article provisional charter in one night. He built a small clique of young and non-corrupt technocrats dubbed the \"Crown Prince Clique\", promoting modernisation and liberalisation.\n\nAs his father sided with the left, Sun was marginalised by the new alliance - forced to resign his mayorship and go north to negotiate with Zhang Zuolin. He briefly considered an alliance with older right-wing elements but was ultimately cowed into submission.\n\nAfter the Northern Expedition failed, he was quick to attack Wang Jingwei's leftist leadership as he regrouped with his loyalists in Hawaii. Sun has emerged as the leader of the centre-right, liberal faction within the Kuomintang known as the Reconstruction Faction."

October 8th, 1879, in Anqing, Anhui Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! $CHI_chen_duxiu_bio$\n\nChen Duxiu takes up the mantle of leadership in a time of great strife. Victorious only with the aid of foreign powers, he has distanced his party from the thrice-failed Kuomintang, but nonetheless factionalism persists. The League, even within the Chinese Syndicalist Party, struggles to maintain cohesion despite being on the cusp of victory. Still, although these circumstances are far from ideal, Chen Duxiu is determined to make his vision for China a reality."
CHI_chen_duxiu_bio: "A lifelong experience of failing his Confucian exams taught Chen Duxiu one thing - that the old order had to go. Centuries of archaic decrepit institutions from the perfidious Manchus simply clogged the progression of mankind, especially in regard to the Marxist interpretation of history.\n\nIn 1915, he would go on to found the popular journal \"New Youth\" and joined fellow leftist educator Cai Yuanpei in Beijing where both men lashed out against the perceived backwardness of China and the necessity for a new model, a new method to allow China to enter the modern age and reassert herself in the world once more. In Beijing, he was attracted to Li Dazhao's Marxist study group and, when word broke out of the revolution in France in 1919, Chen Duxiu believed that syndicalism was China's natural progression in the Marxist paradigm; the Chinese workers and peasants would lead the revolution against the corrupt bourgeoisie and feudal warlords to save China from ruin. Inspired, in 1921 Chen Duxiu and other prominent socialist leaders gathered in Shanghai to proclaim the Chinese Syndicalist Party (CSP).\n\nWhen the Kuomintang rose up in 1923, the Commune of France's recognition of the Kuomintang was granted only on the condition that the Kuomintang accept the CSP as a junior partner in the national revolution. Emboldened, Chen and the CSP organised the greater League of Chinese Syndicalists in 1925. However, when the Northern Expedition ended in failure in 1927, the Chinese Syndicalist Party fled alongside the Kuomintang. Chen Duxiu headed for a life of secrecy and exile, changing locations frequently from friendly Guangdong to the narrow alleyways of Shanghai's red-light districts."

CHI_hu_zongnan_bio: "As a bright-eyed and ambitious cadet at the Whampoa Military Academy, the words on the gate of Whampoa were forever etched into Hu Zongnan's memory: \"Don't go past this door if you are greedy for life and fearful for death.\" In those halls, he distinguished himself as a cadet of Whampoa's very first class, despite being turned down initially due to his short stature (only accepted by the intervention of Liao Zhongkai). His distinguished participation in the Eastern and Northern Expeditions earned him the praise and favour of Chiang Kai-shek, but it was ultimately for nought in 1927.\n\nAfter a major falling-out with He Yingqin, Hu went abroad to France. Already older than most of his fellow students (and a former school teacher), he took on a natural leadership role among many equally dissatisfied officers who felt that the revolution had been betrayed. He kept a careful distance from his more extreme associates, however, allowing him to secure a position as Director of the Training Department within Whampoa while in exile. He has built a steady, secretive following around himself in Whampoa's \"Young Guard\"."

CHI_zeng_zongming_bio_desc: "Like many other youths, Zeng Zhongming and his sister Zeng Xing were caught up by the revolutionary fervour of the 1911 Wuchang Uprising. They went to study abroad in France, where they were joined by their fellow revolutionaries and friends: the newly wedded Wang Jingwei and Chen Bijun. Wang served as a mentor to Zeng, teaching him subjects ranging from history to literature, building a powerful bond.\n\nLiving in the Montargis suburbs south of Paris, they became acquainted with elder revolutionaries Cai Yuanpei and Li Shizeng. After the Great War broke out, Zeng, an educated young man, studied chemistry at the University of Bordeaux and French literature at the University of Lyon. From 1921 to 1924, Zeng served as the Chinese head of Lyon's Sino-French University, created by the new Syndicalist Government to sponsor a culture exchange between Chinese and French revolutionaries.\n\nIn 1925, Zeng returned to China to serve as Wang's secretary on the eve of the Northern Expedition, a job he retained after they fled to exile. He also married his childhood sweetheart Fang Junbi, a Chinese painter and daughter of a well-off Fujianese family. Within Wang's inner circle, there is no one he trusts more than Zeng Zhongming, and there is no disciple, perhaps, who is more faithful to the Chairman."

A prominent Marxist and representative of Guangdong's Chinese Syndicalist Party (CSP) branch, in 1922 he withdrew from the CSP due to his support for Chen Jiongming. In 1923, he went to study at Columbia University before being recruited in 1925 to the Kuomintang by Liao Zhongkai.\n\nFollowing the failure of the Northern Expedition, Chen fled along with the party to France. There he found his footing, becoming the \"chief ideologue\" of the party's radical wing. He also came under the influence of Wang Jingwei, serving as a protege and critical political ally.\n\nAs a testament to his loyalty, he co-founded with Gu Mengyu the Reorganised Comrades Association in France, a faction that claims to be the sole legitimate successor of the old Kuomintang government. Although Wang has refrained from direct membership, the RCA has served as a major vessel for carrying out Wang's directives, and Chen's prominence within the party quickly rose with the RCA. His work with the \"Revolutionary Critic\" laid out many of the policies now accepted as the Kuomintang orthodoxy, solidifying Chen's status as the premier leader of the RCA."

As shy of the public spotlight as he is ruthless, Dai is very rarely seen in public, but is known to be an indulgent playboy of a kind when off-duty."

At once both a brawling, vice-filled troublemaker and a prodigious student (first in his class), he studied to be a teacher but was expelled for theft. He then became a gambler, but was caught cheating and severely beaten. He also tried a variety of other careers before attempting to be a militiaman, flunking out of that as well.\n\nHe then tried to become a Shanghai gangster, meeting Du Yuesheng and Yang Hu and serving as a low level attendant who was often unemployed. At age 30, he seemed to be a failure, \"living off the land\" (and mooching off his cousin), if it wasn't for suddenly meeting with a small group of revolutionaries. This \"Shanghai group\" consisted of fellow Zhejiangers Chiang Kai-shek, Dai Jitao, and Chen Guofu. Perhaps because of them, or because of his connections in organised crime, he became a student at Whampoa.\n\nA bat-man for Chiang, he tried to make himself useful by absorbing information from his classmates. A cavalry cadet, he spent so much time spying that he never actually finished his coursework. He shed his flamboyant personality in favour of silence.\n\nThis served him well after the Northern Expedition failed. Unemployed once more and with his master dead, he set out to create a network of his own - the League of Ten. Tapping into the many now driftless Whampoa alumni as well as Dai's old connections in the Shanghai underground, they have become a potent (albeit small) force.§!\n\n§YNotes: It would not be wise to dismiss Dai as an ordinary gangster.

With the establishment of a newly proclaimed Chinese syndicalist country, Liu's established reputation and ties with the Chinese Syndicalist Party has granted him a prominent position in the Party's Executive Committee and he is ready to lead China to a socialist direction beyond the Kuomintang.§!\n\n§YNotes: A long standing member of the CSP, Liu is an Old Guard of the Party and holds the view that China must develop naturally through greater markets, greater material incentives for workers, and increased funding for consumer industries..§!"

CHI_MMIC_theorist_idea_desc: "§YMission Militaire Internationale en Chine§!\n§gDeployed to China by the Third Internationale following the League War, the MMIC is the evolution of prior socialist efforts to aid the Chinese revolution. Initially consisting of Red Russian émigrés fleeing their civil war sent to aid Dr. Sun in 1924, it has since drawn officers from across the socialist world in an international effort befitting of its sponsors.\n\nThe current head of the Mission is Frenchman André Malraux, who serves a dual role of advising the National Revolutionary Army and promoting it back home. Other figures include David Ramsay of Britain, Manabendra Nath (M.N.) Roy of India, Jean Fontenoy of France, Ingvald Berentin Aase of Norway, and Jakob Rudnik (Paul Ruegg) of Ukraine.\n\nA mixture of political and military officers, their motivations are mixed. Some are drawn by the excitement of an adventure on the other side of the world, others by the tantalising prospect of fame and advancement they could not otherwise achieve at home. Some simply wish to fulfil a sense of internationalist obligation, while others have an affinity for Orientalism.\n\nMany younger NRA officers, particularly those trained abroad or sympathetic to syndicalism, are quite fond of their MMIC trainers. However, they have drawn criticism for their willingness to engage in Chinese politics - seen as undue meddling of internal affairs by many in the Old Guard. The MMIC on the other hand, believe themselves to be the necessary counterweight to reactionary influences in the NRA high command.§!"

He married fellow Shandong native Cao Yi'ou and entered the employment of Yu Qiaqing - whose connections with the Kuomintang helped put Kang in contact with the KMT. After the KMT's return to China, Kang was approached by Zhou Enlai to head internal security operations of the newly created Zhongyang Teke in Shandong. It is here in Shandong where Kang has earned an infamous reputation as a sadistic interrogator, with his methods arousing the frustration of the Party's Central Committee and of Zhou Enlai.

His father worked for the American Standard Oil Company, and his proximity to the foreign concessions of Shanghai meant Mao grew an early distaste for the imperialists bent on carving up China. Related to its then Headmaster Chiang Kai-shek through his relative, Chiang's ex-wife Mao Fumei, Mao enrolled in the newly established Whampoa military academy in Guangzhou.\n\nIn 1927, he graduated from the Third Class of Whampoa Military Academy where he was taught by French advisors basic military training and topics. Unfortunately, he joined the Northern Expedition too late, watching it collapse and forcing him to flee abroad. In exile, he developed an interest in flying and aerial warfare, and he studied in British air academies.

In France he began to study aviation, receiving a commission in the engineering department of the Aviation Bureau of the Chinese Air Force.

 CHI_totalist_party_long: "Whampoa Extremists (Huangbu jiduan fenzi)\n§gThe outcome of the Northern Expedition left many graduates of the highly politicised Whampoa Military Academy deeply embittered and disillusioned. Scattered throughout the nation, many have gone their own route - finding employment however they can.\n\nSome, however, have taken the road of extremism. In Britain, a group of alumni believing their revolution was betrayed internally by ineffectual politicians and attacked externally by foreign imperialists have embraced a form of ultranationalism inspired by the Mosley Memorandum and swirling Sorelian beliefs. Led by He Zhonghan and Deng Wenyi, this secretive but growing group have entered a broader circle led by Hu Zongnan, Director of the Training Department of Whampoa in exile.\n\nFar away, other angry and vengeful alumni await in China toiling in whatever life they have scrounged up. The Kuomintang dream had died, but what would happen if a new revolution ignites?§!"
 CHI_syndicalist_party: "Chinese Syndicalists"
 CHI_syndicalist_party_long: "Assorted Chinese Syndicalist Groups\n§gThe Syndicalist Revolutions changed the world, even as far away as China. It gave the burgeoning anarchist movement in China new life, as many intellectuals reinvented themselves as syndicalists. These groups, the largest of which were the World Society and the Chinese Syndicalist Party, joined the Chinese United Front with the Kuomintang under the shared banner of the League of Chinese Syndicalists.\n\nThe ensuing years, however, have not been as kind. Shattered in the Northern Expedition along with their sister party, the exile period has seen many of the movement's original grass-roots supporters wither away as its leadership smoulders in exile. But there are many who still dream of a libertarian, socialist future for China - and they may very well rise again.§!"
 CHI_radical_socialist_party: "Central Committee"
 CHI_radical_socialist_party_long: "Central Committee of the Kuomintang\n§gAfter the failure of the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee formed a government in exile in Paris. Led by Wang Jingwei as their party chairman and president of the so-called Republic, they have successfully secured the continued recognition of their hosts in the Internationale. In that time, the Reorganised Comrades Association - a group founded by supporters of Wang Jingwei (albeit without Wang's direct participation) has consolidated their grip over the party apparatus.\n\nThat being said, their singular rule over the Kuomintang has been challenged over the last decade or so. The MinGan insurgency has created its own parallel government, while many liberal members of the movement have based themselves in Hawaii. Still, a fracture has been avoided thanks to Wang's careful diplomacy, and in this new revolution he has at last been given an opportunity to free his homeland.§!"
 CHI_social_democrat_party: "MinGan Government"
 CHI_social_democrat_party_long: "MinGan Provisional Government\n§gWhile many fled the nation in wake of the Northern Expedition's collapse, there have been many who chose to stay behind with the people and go underground to resist the oppression of the Zhili clique. Initially led by Marshal Li Jishen and operating with networks flowing in and out of Shanghai, the defeat of the 1932 uprising forced them to retreat southwards to the Jiangxi-Fujian area.\n\nIn the mountains, Song Qingling, Deng Yanda and others published the \"Declaration to the Revolutionary People in China and the World\", announcing the formation of the Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang to autonomously manage the guerilla zone. This, combined with weakening communications with Wang's government in exile, has created a certain independence within MinGan cadres, even as the movement has reunited again. Although for now the Kuomintang leadership have made a show of getting along and indeed plenty have freely come and gone from MinGan and Paris throughout the years, some strains have begun to show.§!"

The CRS sees the complex bureaucratic nature of the Kuomintang to be the party's downfall and wishes to see the party purged of its democratic elements - with the end goal of a party led by a glorious dictator (the lingxiu). From there, they envision China to be developed into a highly militarised and equal society with the notion and ideas of class struggle eradicated in favour of a completely totalitarian and socialist nation. They look to China's antiquity and its Confucian order of old as not elements of ancient history but rather a sense of halcyon tranquillity that will eventually be achieved under the rule of the benevolent lingxiu.

They adhere to a model of strict leadership (seeing the Kuomintang as the vanguard of the socialist revolution) and a party for the peasantry, workers, and petite bourgeoisie. They hold warm and cordial ties with the Third Internationale, and many RCA members also hold relations with the Radical wing of the Chinese Syndicalist Party. Nonetheless, it is a movement that sees the Chinese Nationalist cause as not just one for China but also one for the entirety of Asia. The RCA runs on a platform that China is the socialist vanguard, spreading the revolution far and wide and liberating the oppressed peoples of Asia from the chains of imperialism.

While some members of PAC view the Third Internationale's extension into China as a potential threat to the native revolution practised in China, the PAC nonetheless has shown a willingness to work with members of the Orthodox Faction of the Chinese Syndicalist Party as well as an equally beneficial relationship with the World Society.

CHI_land_tax_desc:0 "The concept of a Land Value or Land Use Tax has been a policy darling of progressive reformers worldwide, and is most associated with the economic theories of Henry George. Since the earliest days of the KMT, the Land Use Tax has been unanimously approved by the party, and its legal implementation will ensure both a continual source of income and a passive means of fighting wealth accumulation."
CHI_opium_prohibition:0 "Opium Prohibition"
CHI_opium_prohibition_desc:0 "Opium has been the scourge of China since the beginning of the Century of Humiliation, and vast swathes of south-east China suffer from endemic opiate addiction. As a matter of national security and pride, we must not just eradicate opium production but also crack down on its trade and possession within controlled territories."
CHI_opium_tax:0 "Tax The Opium Trade"
CHI_opium_tax_desc:0 "Opium addiction and trafficking is a serious issue in China, but we realistically cannot do more than ban its production within our territories and crack down on smuggling. Prohibitive taxes on opium sold within legal channels will allow this vice to be used for the good of the country's treasury."
CHI_gannan_deal:0 "Gannan New Deal"
CHI_gannan_deal_desc:0 "There are proposals within the Minquan faction to turn Gannan Province into a model region for future Chinese development. Social programs such as state orphanages, free clinics and schools, and public housing may show to the world that even in the most remote regions of a wartorn China, the Nationalists are dedicated to improving the quality of life for all citizens."

CHI_yangste_offensive:0 "Prepare Lower Yangtze Offensive"
CHI_yangste_offensive_desc:0 "The League of Eight Provinces is shattered, but its core, the Nanjing Clique, still survives and may stabilize itself soon. To finally upend the status quo in Southern China, we need to strike at their center of power in Jiangsu Province. Our ace in the hole is the ZhongTeJu bureau, which has filled the Clique's territory with Nationalist cells that will surely cause mass sabotage of their defences."
CHI_contact_cells:0 "Reorganize Nationalist Cells"
CHI_contact_cells_desc:0 "As more of China is liberated from the warlords, the KMT's structure as an underground party becomes pointless. We need loyal and competent party members to help administer the governments of the prefectures, and these local party members are the ideal candidates. Party cells in controlled regions should be reorganized into regional Party Directorates until a more formalized government is established."
CHI_handle_SQI:0 "Handle The Millenarians"
CHI_handle_SQI_desc:0 "The province of Shandong has been brought directly into contact with us thanks to the League War. If we are to ever take China for the people we must deal with this potential threat, preventing it from spreading through the south east."
CHI_VNQDD_liasons:0 "Liason with DVQDD Rebels"
CHI_VNQDD_liasons_desc:0 "The DVQDD, or 'Dai Viet Kuomintang,' is our sister organization in Indochina and is just as devoted to the cause of democratic anti-imperialism in Asia as we are. With our borders touching the Indochinese region, we may be able to more closely aid and cooperate with them as part of their work within the wider world of native Indochinese politics."
CHI_HNN_intervention:0 "Support KMT in Hunan"
CHI_HNN_intervention_desc:0 "The only remaining democracy in Hunan was discovered by some members of the Kuomintang. However, Hunan Clique is still firmly controlled by non-KMT forces, and our revolutionary progress is developing very slowly there. By expanding the influence of KMT in Hunan Province, it will make it easier for us to revolutionize."
CHI_chen_mingshu_reconcile:0 "Support KMT in Liangguang"
CHI_chen_mingshu_reconcile_desc:0 "Leader of Liangguang KMT is a oddity among the rogue NRA generals in that he favours left-wing politics, but he is totally opposed to the more authoritarian factions within the Chinese left. With the Central Committee's new alignment towards the democratic principles of the Minquan, we have a rare opportunity to peacefully reunify the region through negotiated talks."
CHI_plan_southern:0 "Unite Southern China"
CHI_plan_southern_desc:0 "The Kuomintang must control or pacify the rest of Southern China before any attempt at a second Northern Expedition can take place. To this end, the National Revolutionary Army must begin planning expeditions against the remaining independent southern warlords with the intelligence and special operations aid of the ZhongTeJu."
CHI_SZC_intervention:0 "Reconcile with KMT in Sichuan"
CHI_SZC_intervention_desc:0 "In the chaotic world of Sichuanese politics, the Officer Department is the only group with a favourable view of the KMT. By supporting Officer Department in their provincial power struggles, we could gain a valuable ally, or even control of the entire province through them."
CHI_YUN_reconcile:0 "Reconciliation with KMT in Yunnan"
CHI_YUN_reconcile_desc:0 "After the Northern Expedition, the remnants of the armies controlled by the Right KMT found refuge in Yunnan province. With the victory of the Center-Right KMT in Yunnan's recent power struggles, we may have a chance to mend the old Nationalist party together and form a powerful front to unify South China together."
CHI_plan_western:0 "Plan Western Expedition"
CHI_plan_western_desc:0 "The far-western regions of Yunnan and Sichuan may seem like a sideshow to the struggle for dominance of China, but securing their loyalty and resources may prove the difference between victory and defeat. Without any other paths towards a diplomatic solution, we may have to resort to a military campaign against the south-western warlords."

CHI_mingshu:0 "Chen Mingshu Victorious"
CHI_mingshu_desc:0 "With the KMT revolt in Fujian a failure it is now up to Chen Mingshu to ensure China is under Kuomintang rule. There are still problems facing Chen such as the poweful gentry and merchants, on top of that there is unrest in Liangguang which we will need to deal with."
CHI_National_Plan:0 "The National Plan"
CHI_National_Plan_desc:0 "With the National Plan we can use elements of Chen Jiongmings government to make the integration of China a lot more easier. This is because his form of government was based off the American states which makes it more appealing for the governors as they can retain some autonomy for the time being."
CHI_Respect_Chen_Jiongming:0 "Implementing Guangdong Policies"
CHI_Respect_Chen_Jiongming_desc:0 "The lands of the potential United Provinces are under our control however that doesn't mean we can't fulfil Chen's legacy. If we fine tune his ideals to fit with ours we could gain a large amount of wealth and support from the people."

CHI_guangdong_deal_desc:0 "The Guangdong Province is a true example of a model region for future Chinese development. If we try to bring Social programs such as state orphanages, free clinics and schools, and public housing to other provinces in our control we may show to the world that even in the most remote regions of a wartorn China, the Nationalists are dedicated to improving the quality of life for all citizens."
CHI_Consolidate_Liangguang:0 "Consolidate Liangguang"
CHI_Consolidate_Liangguang_desc:0 "The pressing issues that arose both before and after the civil war still need to be addressed, until they are sorted the Northern Expedition will have to wait until a later date which gives the enemy more time the prepare."
CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangxi:0 "Control the Unrest in Guangxi"
CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangxi_desc:0 "Guangxi has not been spared the turmoil that has gripped large parts of China following the collapse of the League. Our new administration must tend to the unrest in this province, be it from reactionaries, bandits or Yiguandao agitators."
CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangdong:0 "Control the Unrest in Guangdong"
CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangdong_desc:0 "Much of this province still bears the influence of warlord dominance that threaten the stability of the people's government. Efforts should be made to put an end to their influence."
CHI_expropriate_landlords2:0 "Expropriate Landlords"
CHI_expropriate_landlords2_desc:0 "Private landlords control the vast majority of China's arable land, and as Black Monday's financial after-effects worm its way into the Chinese economy, tenant farmers suffer from ever-higher land rents. Rather than a more complicated process of regulating land rent rates, the KMT should instead seize the land of the largest landlords in liberated regions and return it to the farmers."

CHI_Gentry_Concession:0 "Provide Gentry Concessions"
CHI_Gentry_Concession_desc:0 "The gentry and their excesses are a product of a bad system. Instead of taking a heavy-handed approach, we can make concessions towards them and win their support. It'll be easier than fighting them every step of the way, allowing us to move forward with our reforms without major disruptions to the existing economic infrastructure."
CHI_Gentry_Force:0 "Crack Down on the Gentry"
CHI_Gentry_Force_desc:0 "The upper classes are but leeches that suck the blood out of the worker. Their excesses end here. We'll make them abide by the rules just like everyone else and work just like everyone else. There will be some inevitable transitional pains to the economy, but it's a price worth paying for justice."
CHI_Merchants_Concession:0 "Provide Merchant Concessions"
CHI_Merchants_Concession_desc:0 "While it's true that the merchant classes have lived off the people, we can't uproot the entire commercial system overnight. By making certain concessions to the merchant classes to have them support us and adapt to our rule, we should see a smoother transition for the people's government."
CHI_Merchants_Force:0 "Crack Down on the Merchants"
CHI_Merchants_Force_desc:0 "We cannot count the number of times that the merchants have squeezed every last penny out of the commoner without a care for his plight. It's time that we started to put the screws on these jackals and have them contribute to the common good for a change, even if that means that there will be a period of adjustment."
CHI_Revoloution_Secured:0 "Revolution Secured"
CHI_Revoloution_Secured_desc:0 "Our revolutionary brothers and sisters may have fallen, but not in vain. We shall pick up the torch of revolution where they left off and continue their work towards a better China. Through us, the Kuomintang rises again like a mighty phoenix!"

CHI_form_army:0 "The 2nd NRA"
CHI_form_army_desc:0 "We are now in open revolt, and as such our military forces must move from insurgency tactics back to conventional warfare against the Warlords. More units must be raised in larger formations, and in doing so we will form a Second National Revolutionary Army to finally unify China."
CHI_regional_militias:0 "Regional Militias"
CHI_regional_militias_desc:0 "With the collapse of League authority in Fujian and Jiangxi province, local self-defence societies have formed to maintain order. We must try to integrate them into the NRA's structure as regional militias to bolster our small core forces."
CHI_one_army:0 "One-Nation-One-Army Policy"
CHI_one_army_desc:0 "Local forces loyal to a general or town instead of the Party-State cannot be trusted, and relying on them is a devil's bargain. These bandits and petty warlords need to be neutralized by security sweeps before they can establish themselves. The byline of 'One-Nation-One-Army' should be taken to heart in our military planning and future expansion of the NRA."
CHI_tigress_battalions:0 "Tigress Battalions"
CHI_tigress_battalions_desc:0 "The NRA has seen the equal valor of women in combat, though it has not yet developed any programs to fully allow women to participate as enlisted soldiers or officers. Upon the urging of Song Qingling, the NRA has begun a formal program to train women as officers and soldiers. The program also envisions training all-female 'tigress battalions' for front line and garrison duties."
CHI_peoples_army:0 "Prioritize Manpower"
CHI_peoples_army_desc:0 "China has a vast population, and we should expect our enemies to have vast armies as well. Trying to outperform our enemies by investing in a quality that our industries are in no shape to supply will cause our armies to be greatly overwhelmed by the sheer size of warlords armies that have built up over time. Nothing less than turning the NRA into a mass People's Army will suffice given the foes we are up against."
CHI_modern_divisions:0 "Prioritize Modernization"
CHI_modern_divisions_desc:0 "Any new Chinese army needs to be founded again from first principles as a modern force. While we should try to maximize the number of units raised for the war, our equipment procurement and plans for expansion should prioritize creating new and modern forces that are not just superior to the haphazard divisions of the warlords, but equal in quality to those of western powers."
CHI_asymmetrical_warfare:0 "Asymmetrical Warfare"
CHI_asymmetrical_warfare_desc:0 "As we evolve the National Revolutionary Army from a guerrilla force into a fully fledged army, our vast experience in fighting unconventionally against the rigid formations of the warlords should be developed, not squandered. By having our training empathize this we'll be able to excel where purely conventional armies struggle."
CHI_dare_to_die:0 "Dare-To-Die Corps"
CHI_dare_to_die_desc:0 "It is a sad fact that in these desperate times, often all a man is able to give to a cause is his life. The concept of 'Dare-To-Die' soldiers as patriotic martyrs dates back to the Xinhai Revolution, but during the Warlord Era the term expanded to refer to all small units tasked with suicidal attacks. As the war expands Dare-To-Die tactics and the original Xinhai spirit that accompanied it begin to show their appeal."
CHI_airborne_corps:0 "Airborne Corps"
CHI_airborne_corps_desc:0 "Control of the skies in the wars for China is both possible and plausible, and it is under these conditions that we can try to establish our own airborne corps similar to those of other nations. A properly-placed paradrop will allow our forces to develop new flanking manoeuvrers and keep our enemies fearful of the skies."
CHI_conscription:0 "Conscription Squads"
CHI_conscription_desc:0 "Unfortunately, forming an adequately-sized army on volunteers alone is not possible at this stage in the revolution. By forming special task forces to enforce conscription in liberated territories, our armies can more easily reach their projected build-up quotas."
CHI_mechanized:0 "Mechanized Warfare Study Commission"
CHI_mechanized_desc:0 "Armoured vehicles have been sparse in Chinese warfare, but regardless of our opinion that will not be for long. As a matter of national security, the Nationalists should be the first faction in China to study, perfect and introduce motorized vehicles and tank warfare into the Chinese theatre in mass numbers."
CHI_stratified:0 "Stratified Unit Quality"
CHI_stratified_desc:0 "Due to the size and scope of the NRA's forces, we cannot realistically make all of our forces trained or equipped to the same quality. Our backline and low-priority units should be de-prioritized in terms of equipment and training in order to maximize the quality of our front line troops."
CHI_blocking_detachments:0 "Encirclement Detachments"
CHI_blocking_detachments_desc:0 "The rugged and mountainous regions of China are far beyond the capacity of regular troops to adequately navigate. For future campaigns in China and beyond, specialized detachments of infantry need to be trained for mountain warfare against smaller local forces."
CHI_modern_combined_arms:0 "Modern Combined Arms"
CHI_modern_combined_arms_desc:0 "The art of synchronising artillery, infantry, and armour into a successful offence is still new, but we cannot let other powers develop the perfect implementation ahead of us. The National Revolution's wars will allow us to learn what technical specifications are needed to create ideal arms and artillery for modern wars."

CHI_restore_whampoa:0 "Restore The Academy"
CHI_restore_whampoa_desc:0 "The old military academy in Whampoa was officially disestablished after the German intervention in China occupied Guangdong Province in 1925, but its staff, records, and other resources all survived and are currently spread across the world. We are now in a position to re-found the Republic of China Military Academy and begin training our officer corps independent of other powers."
CHI_nat_air_army:0 "National Air Army"
CHI_nat_air_army_desc:0 "Up until now the NRA's doctrine and use of military aircraft has been largely hypothetical or improvisational. However, the Weltkrieg has proved that air power in modern warfare is an undeniable factor in victory. With the growth of our industrial base and funds allowing for actual air fleets to be assembled, we can now fully commit to establishing a new branch of the NRA- the National Air Army."
CHI_flexible_aircraft:0 "Flexible Aircraft Specifications"
CHI_flexible_aircraft_desc:0 "China does not have the mechanical skill or industrial depth to have the best native avionic designs for each application of air power in war. Because of these constraints, it is best to focus on producing cheap, reliable, and flexible plane designs that can work as both support craft and strategic bombers."
CHI_heavy_airframes:0 "Heavy Airframes Focus"
CHI_heavy_airframes_desc:0 "China is vast, and our air force will be stretched thin to cover all combat regions. Prioritizing the development of long-distance, heavy-frame aircraft can allow us to let air wings be strategically flexible in their choice of targets or supporting missions."
CHI_build_airfields:0 "Strategic Airfields Initiative"
CHI_build_airfields_desc:0 "It is easier to build an airfield than a highway, and in the underdeveloped Chinese interior roads are scarce. Building strategic airfields at key regions in provinces will allow for both better communication with the Central Government and also allow for air support in nearby battle zones."
CHI_naval_aviation:0 "Coast-to-Ship Air Support"
CHI_naval_aviation_desc:0 "Naval aviation in the sense of carrier forces is currently beyond China's capability or needs, but torpedo bombers and sea planes are necessary for any proactive coastal defence. Anti-ship squadrons that are stationed on land will be just as useful in repelling attacks and securing littoral zones as any aircraft carrier."

CHI_separate_naval_command:0 "Separate Naval Command"
CHI_separate_naval_command_desc:0 "Up until now much of the Republic of China Navy has been effectively subordinated to the needs of the NRA. However, any nation that wants security on its own terms needs to have a strong navy. As victories mount on land, Admiral Chen Shaokuan has pushed for more independence for the Navy and for serious consideration of building up a navy capable of independent operations at sea."
CHI_coastal_fleets:0 "Light Ship Focus"
CHI_coastal_fleets_desc:0 "China's naval forces have always been reliant on foreign shipyards and designers for its fleets. The first generation of all-Chinese fleet production should focus on the development of light and heavy cruisers for the most economical and versatile results, as opposed to plunging into the more doctrinally-uncertain world of battleships and carriers."
CHI_coastal_defenses:0 "Coastal Defence Stratagems"
CHI_coastal_defenses_desc:0 "China's greatest naval concern is securing its coastline against the imperial powers. Coordination between all involved parties- coastal NRA garrisons, air wings, and the navy- should be enforced by the Central Government and specific mixed-service chains of command and protocols should be pre-established to prevent any operational chaos."
CHI_integrate_beiyang_navy:0 "Fate of Beiyang Naval Staff"
CHI_integrate_beiyang_navy_desc:0 "The Nationalist government's navy is small and lacking in trained officers. While the warlordism of the Zhili army is irredeemable, the Beiyang Navy's command structure may have enough officers of decent moral quality that it may be beneficial to review their records and offer the trustworthy a commission now that the Qing and Zhili jackals have finally been put down."
CHI_submarine_doctrine:0 "Study Submarine Warfare"
CHI_submarine_doctrine_desc:0 "Submarine warfare has allowed other nations with a seeming naval disadvantage to strike fear into the merchant marines of their enemies. Given the effectiveness of these forces during the Weltkrieg and afterwards, many admirals argue that the ROCN should turn towards submarine warfare as a way to leapfrog past the old paradigm of surface navies with vulnerable capital ships."
CHI_naval_infantry:0 "Chinese Naval Infantry"
CHI_naval_infantry_desc:0 "The modern art of coastal landings opens up not just unexpected feints across the Yellow Sea or Gulf of Hanoi, but also the retaking of Taiwan from the Japanese. A joint program by the NRA and ROCN to develop specialized naval infantry regiments will help to keep our enemies on their toes and our strategic options as open as the ocean's horizon."

CHI_military_affairs_cmsn:0 "Military Affairs Commission"
CHI_military_affairs_cmsn_desc:0 "With the expansion of the NRA into multiple branches in multiple front regions, a new central command overseeing all theatres of the revolution must be established. Though a formality, this commission should ensure that all decision-makers are on the same page and know our capabilities."
CHI_sanmin_commissars:0 "Sanmin Political Commissars"
CHI_sanmin_commissars_desc:0 "The National Revolution that we are fighting for is not just a series of military campaigns, but a social and political revolution. We must make sure that our officers make field decisions in accordance with the Three Principles of the People and our political goals. To this end, the Party has assigned political commissars to military units both for education in Sanmin ideology and to advise officers in political affairs."
CHI_special_methods_division:0 "Special Methods Division"
CHI_special_methods_division_desc:0 "As we liberate more and more provinces of China from the warlords and nobles it's inevitable that the resistance from those that benefited from their regimes will resist us. To overcome this, we'll train and deploy specialized commissars to deal with reactionaries behind the lines to suppress the reactionaries."
CHI_retake_taiwan:0 "Go Forth and Reclaim Taiwan"
CHI_retake_taiwan_desc:0 "The island of Taiwan was surrendered to Japan after the first Sino-Japanese war and has suffered under their jackboot ever since. With our positions on the mainland secured and both our army and navy built up, we're finally in a position to liberate our Taiwanese comrades from the Japanese yoke once and for all."

CHI_1st_congress:0 "1st Repatriated Congress of The KMT"
CHI_1st_congress_desc:0 "After a decade overseas, the Central Committee of the KMT has returned to China in triumph. Now that the initial war against the Nanjing Clique is complete, the KMT has enough breathing room to reorganize and plan its future path towards national reunification."
CHI_1st_congress_GXC:0 "1st Repatriated Congress of The KMT"
CHI_1st_congress_GXC_desc:0 "After the decisive defeat of the KMT in Fujian the Left Kuomintang was thought to be over for good. This changed however as Chen Mingshu managed to bring the revolution to Liangguang and prevent the fall of republicanism in China. Now that many internal issues have been put to rest, the KMT has enough breathing room to reorganize and plan its future path towards national reunification."

CHI_revive_china:0 "Revive China Program"
CHI_revive_china_desc:0 "Without the Nationalist Party, there will be no new China. A vast program of extensive state planning and initiatives is necessary to bring China back up to the same level as the West."
CHI_national_RC:0 "National Reconstruction Commission"
CHI_national_RC_desc:0 "Inspired by proposals drafted by Zhang Renjie, a centrally-directed National Reconstruction Commission should be formed by the Nationalist Government to plan a nationwide program of capital investments and standardizations. This program will involve multiple independently-scaling efforts centred around several major population areas."
CHI_1st_industrial:0 "First Industrialization Phase"
CHI_1st_industrial_desc:0 "The first planned phase of industrialization for each base region will involve expanding the infrastructural capacity and heavy industries needed for future construction."
CHI_standard_rail_gauges:0 "Standardized Railway Gauges"
CHI_standard_rail_gauges_desc:0 "Railway development in China has been sporadic in particular the warlord governments have intentionally chosen gauges different from those of their regional rivals to prevent any easy invasion, and foreign firms would use whatever gauge was cheapest to build tunnels and bridges for. As part of our industrial programs, we must invest time and effort into converting all our railways to the standard gauge."
CHI_2nd_industrial:0 "Second Industrialization Phase"
CHI_2nd_industrial_desc:0 "The second planned phase of industrialization for each base region involves the development of factories reliant on fine tooling, such as consumer goods and military munitions."
CHI_natl_dockyard:0 "National Dockyard Effort"
CHI_natl_dockyard_desc:0 "As part of our larger industrialization plans, major ports under our control should have their capabilities for shipbuilding and repair expanded."
CHI_academica_sinica:0 "Academica Sinica"
CHI_academica_sinica_desc:0 "To better foster the development of our native scientific capabilities, the KMT must commit to creating and sponsoring our own academic research institutions. Long proposed but never enacted, the fully established Academica Sinica will be the centre of these efforts."
CHI_bopomofo:0 "Bo, Po, Mo, Fo..."
CHI_bopomofo_desc:0 "The current methods for romanizing Mandarin Chinese and even teaching the Chinese script are woefully inadequate for children or the everyday person. A new standard for phonetic symbols, similar to the Hiragana syllabary created for Japanese, should be created and spread throughout our educational system to help standardize the Chinese dialects and open mass conversation with the West."
CHI_foreign_research:0 "Foreign Research Partnerships"
CHI_foreign_research_desc:0 "Like it or not, the Nationalist Government cannot modernize the country without working with the international scientific community. By forming research and graduate training agreements with friendly foreign powers, we can start to build up China's own scientific prowess"

CHI_proclaim_new_republic:0 "Assert Independence from Beijing"
CHI_proclaim_new_republic_desc:0 "Our government's independence from Beijing has been self-evident for some time. Declaring an official declaration of independence, whilst only giving us some support within our government, will show our opposition to the Qing monarchists. This act will remind the world that we are not just 'The Kuomintang' but instead the Nationalist Government and the rightful heir to the Xinhai Revolution."
CHI_choose_capital:0 "Choose the Republican Capital"
CHI_choose_capital_desc:0 "The Nationalist Government is secure enough that we now need to put down more permanent infrastructural roots. The first step is to declare one of our politically prominent cities as a new Republican capital- the most favored location by the KMT's membership is Nanjing, but Wuchang and Beijing also have their merits and supporters."
CHI_build_national_mausoleum:0 "Build the National Mausoleum"
CHI_build_national_mausoleum_desc:0 "With the capital established, it is long past due to honour those who have fallen in service of Chinese Democracy. A national mausoleum will be constructed outside of [Root.Capital.GetName] to house the remains of Sun Yat-Sen, Chiang Kai-Shek, and other prominent revolutionaries."
CHI_new_culture_movement:0 "National Culture Movement"
CHI_new_culture_movement_desc:0 "Chinese civilization can be seen as a continuous cultural tradition and identity thousands of years old, but this has not yet really translated into a 'nationalism' as strong or dynamic as that created and practiced by European powers. A civic nationalism greater than any warlord's cynical appeals to federalism needs to be instilled by cultural grants, public works, and sponsored mass media."
CHI_est_civil_service:0 "Establish Civil Service"
CHI_est_civil_service_desc:0 "To endure in the long run, the Nationalist Government must be more than a warlord clique or a party-state. A civil service that is independent of both the Kuomintang party apparatus and the army must begin formation, even at such an early stage as this."
CHI_provisional_legislature:0 "Provisional Legislative Yuan"
CHI_provisional_legislature_desc:0 "While China is not anywhere ready for full elections, the Nationalist Government needs to begin forming the institutions that democracy will, one day, make its will known through. A provisional legislature, staffed by KMT representatives from both controlled and contested territories, will take over legislative responsibilities from the Central Committee."
CHI_ethnic_autonomy:0 "Ethnic Autonomous Regions"
CHI_ethnic_autonomy_desc:0 "Within the 18 provinces that make up China there are a myriad of ethnic groups, many of whom have painful memories of repression from the Han and Manchu. Rather than reopening these old wounds by ruling with a strong hand, we'll mend them by granting these ethnic groups a degree of self-rule within our nation."
CHI_unitary_state:0 "Unitary Government"
CHI_unitary_state_desc:0 "Whether it's by class or ethnicity, the last thing China needs is more division and splintering. In order the better pursue the interests of all the people of China in these turbulent times, a strong and centralized state is needed to safeguard our young republic against reactionary forces."
CHI_rec_syndies:0 "Recognize Urban Syndicalists"
CHI_rec_syndies_desc:0 "The support from syndicalists, be it aid from foreign states or local groups rising up to stand up for their rights, was vital in securing our revolution. In light of this, we should allow them to have a greater voice in the organization of labour as well."
CHI_national_labor:0 "All-China National Labour Syndicate"
CHI_national_labor_desc:0 "While we appreciate the aid from syndicalists in our liberation struggle we must also be the ones that decide our own fate. As such, the Kuomintang will remain the only institution in China with a guiding voice on labour relations in China during the period of tutelage."
CHI_local_democracy:0 "Local Democratic Government"

CHI.introgame.000.d: "In the late winter of 1927, the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang)'s National Revolution was on the brink of collapse following a series of major military defeats and the death of the expedition's commander §PChiang Kai-shek§!. With the destruction of the Kuomintang's National Revolutionary Army (NRA), §lGeneral Li Jishen§! convinced a part of the NRA to continue the revolution by waging a protracted war of resistance against the §PZhili warlords§! and their German lackeys. He was joined by §SSong Qingling§! and later §SDeng Yanda§!, and after the failure of their §r1932 Shanghai Uprising§! they decided to flee for the remote mountainous villages and forests of southeastern Jiangxi and northwestern Fujian, hoping to one day strike back. Meanwhile, the §RCentral Committee of the Kuomintang§!, dominated by the Party's left wing, fled for Europe - hoping to organise a government of exile to perhaps one day liberate China.\n\nHere in the remote rural backwater of southern China, §SSong Qingling's§! populist-based government has created a unique movement shrouded in secrecy- one with ties to cells and allied towns in the region. Peasants (both men and women) are trained and taught by NRA officers, hoping to inspire a new generation of revolutionaries - capable of fulfilling the mission of national salvation. They are taught that there shall be no class and chains in the Kuomintang's free China. They are further aided by a vast network of spies, informants, party cells, and fellow leftists in the Shanghai Neutral Zone - with rumours of §oeven criminal organisations§! playing a role in arms smuggling and supplies.\n\nIn 1932, Chinese syndicalists, socialists, and members of the Kuomintang staged mass strikes across the eastern seaboard of China - hoping to cripple the despicable §PLeague of Eight Provinces§!.

CHI.introgame.001.d: "Despite their primarily proclaimed \"unity\" as the true heirs of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution, the leftist-dominated Kuomintang is an increasingly factional party. Years of distance and personal distrust between the party members has led to the creation of two significant factions within the Party.\n\nMaking up the dominant faction within the Central Committee, the §RReorganised Comrades Association (RCA)§! represents a coalition of both §Rradical§! and §Smoderate§! socialists who fled for Europe with §RChairman Wang Jingwei§!. Originally a secret organisation with cells in the Chinese European expatriate community as well as the Legation Cities, the RCA takes its name from the \"Reorganisation\" of the Party in 1924 - when the KMT took inspiration from the post-Great War socialist revolutions.  As such, they believe that the Party must be purified and reorganised - to create a new revolutionary NRA made up of the peasants and workers and that the Kuomintang will indeed be a vanguard in a forthcoming materialist \"class struggle.\" To do so, the RCA believes that the revolution must be furnished from above; an educated and patriotic cadre must lead the masses to revolutionary triumph.\n\nThe second largest faction within the leftist-dominated Kuomintang are those who fled with §SSong Qingling§! to the MinGan insurgent zone. Declaring themselves as the §SProvisional Action Committee (PAC)§!, citing that the greatest solution to China's woes would be to administer direct action as soon as possible. The PAC believes that a revolution must instead start from the bottom up and that \"exceptional\" individuals such as §SGeneral Deng Yanda§! are to help the masses achieve revolutionary consciousness - however, this puts them at odds with the European returnees."

Since popularised among elements of the European far-left, §o\"totalism\"§! has achieved a small but certainly growing following among young §oradical military officers§! - who believe that democracy has no place in a China free of imperialism.\n\nNot all members of the Kuomintang chose exile in Europe and China, a noticeable amount of centrists and other like-minded \"liberals\", fled for Southeast Asia or the United States (especially Hawaii). The nominal head of this §l\"Overseas Chinese Commission\" (OCC)§! is §lSun Fo§!, the son of the Party's founder. Still, nonetheless, it is reported that the OCC also has support with NRA officers who were sent to [HND.GetNameDef] for political and military training.\n\nAs part of its \"United Front\" policies and in exchange for receiving aid and recognition by the Third Internationale; the Kuomintang is also compelled to work with other socialist groups in China who are not affiliated with the KMT.

#TODO: 003-009 decide what to do

CHI.introgame.003.t: "The Year of the Rat"
CHI.introgame.003.d: "A new year comes to a China long overdue for a change. It's been four years since the unsuccessful Shanghai Uprising across the eastern seaboard, and almost a decade since the collapse of the Northern Expedition. But like the zodiac, the same cycles of poverty and exploitation continue on. And like rats, Kuomintang insurgents remain underground in hiding, festering in their squalor.\n\nBut they continue to survive nonetheless. The repeated \"Encirclement Campaigns\" waged by the League of Eight Provinces and their German advisors have come to nil despite their material superiority because of endemic corruption, crafty insurgent leaders, and the sheer tenacity of the guerillas. Although unable to stop the League from controlling major population centres, they have hampered League efforts to control the hinterland.\n\nStill, as the New Year approaches (the new year begins January 24th in traditional calendars still used by many commoners), the MinGan insurgency have little else to retreat to. For all the failures of the encirclement campaigns, they have largely isolated meaningful rebellion to the Fujian-Jiangxi region, far from the centres of power. Socialist cells often remain divided and even in the heart of MinGan the \"people's government's control\" is often illusory.\n\nIts leaders know full well that there would be no insurgency if it was not for the sacrifices of the people, who often offer support great and small that allow MinGan to trudge onwards. The nexus point of socialist resistance, MinGan is a hub with spokes extending deep into China, connecting them with various networks stretching into sympathetic cities such as Guangzhou, Shanghai and Xiamen. But supply shipments have grown more difficult over the years thanks to improved League patrols and Legation crackdowns. As they plan their next operation to smuggle equipment, MinGan turns to..."

Exploiting cheap Chinese labour (and a token Chinese representation among the engineers), the Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung (AOG) have built a large railway extending from Shanghai to Nanchang. The AOG is an extension of German concessionism, an arm for corporate conglomerates hoping to exploit Chinese resources. Their move into Jiangxi (the heart of MinGan), paying numerous bribes and braving our best efforts to stop them, has been a source of despair as they brushed aside sabotage and corruption alike.\n\nBut in many ways, perhaps that same determined avarice is the capitalists' downfall. Betraying their local partners and any promises of a more egalitarian future, scandal broke out when the AOG suddenly announced their decision to consolidate their controlling shares in various Chinese railways into one on behalf of the Schantung-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (an AOG subsidiary).\n\nThis move to entrench German dominance and force Chinese managers to answer to a German board has backfired, with widespread anger boiling over across the League. The Zhegan railway, once a much advertised sign of progress, has now become a symbol of the continued humiliation of the Chinese people. It seems the Germans have forgotten their history - it was not long ago that a similar rail dispute in China set forth the fall of an empire..."

The much vaunted Zhegan railway project has awoken decades of pent up anger among the long-suffering Chinese people. With waves of condemnation coming from concerned intellectuals, socialist factory pamphlets, and nationalist publications of all stripes, it seems that the scandal has struck a deep nerve across a broad section of Chinese society.\n\nThe spark of resistance has spread like wildfire. In cities both in the League and elsewhere, there have been widespread protests and boycotts against the AOG. Railroads have been attacked and sabotaged, and League authorities (themselves said to be fuming over the Germans' betrayal) have been slow to stop them. Various officials and foreign citizens said to be tied to Zhegan have been attacked by mobs and some assassinated in the anti-concessionist frenzy.\n\nWhile Kuomintang and other socialist insurgents can claim credit for some of them, they are not even close to a majority. It seems this outpouring of public anger stem from a genuine grass roots, popular anger. One that the party is eager to take part in even if doubts remain among the leadership if it will amount to much. The party's deployment of its agents are expected to be most influential in the southern parts of the League where their hold remains strong (if waning).

As striking workers amassed in German factories in Anhui province, their demonstrations were joined by a growing number of protesters that flooded the streets. The police, reinforced by German-trained soldiers, fired upon the crowd.\n\nThe numbers seem to multiply every time the story is retold from person to person, and tales of German advisors deliberately ordering the shootings have spread as well. The end result has been the same, with protests growing in size and numbers and the crisis showing little signs of abating. What began as a protest against German economic overreach has exploded into broader calls for social change, ranging from the abolition of the monarchy, to the elimination of concessionism, to the overthrow of warlords, to the unification of the country, and to the end of capitalism.\n\nMany of the protesters shout to no one in particular, venting their frustrations even though they hold little hope much will be done in a stagnant, divided China. But for the Kuomintang, the moment is nigh. A powder-keg has been set off, and not simply one of anti-concessionism. A propaganda offensive has already gone underway, casting them as heroes in China's hour of need. But there are many promises in the air, and the Kuomintang are hardly the only ones making them."

Stockbrokers and traders watched with horror as the Shanghai Stock Exchange began closing at record numbers unseen since Shanghai was shaken by the financial tumult of 1925, and local institutions are doing what they can to mitigate the damage.\n\nTo many Kuomintang leaders in Paris, especially figures such as Chen Gongbo and Shi Cuntong, the financial chaos of Black Monday is exactly as Marx predicted: the beginning of possibly a new order, one free from the insatiable greed of capitalism. KMT and LCS cells buzz with activity, mobilising sympathetic unions and other workers' organisations in major cities. The League of Eight Provinces' authority is rapidly eroding, as exemplified by Anqing's break from Nanjing. A recent naval mutiny in Fujian has likewise spurred interest in Paris and Wang Jingwei has ordered the build up of resources in India.\n\nHidden away in the hills and forests of the MinGan Insurgent Zone, Song Qingling and her government have amassed considerable independence from the Central Committee in Paris. Communication between the two Kuomintang governments is limited, and most of the day-to-day operations of the insurgency are led by Song's lieutenants. Among her most trusted military commanders are Generals Li Jishen and Deng Yanda, who believe that the nightmare of Zhili authority over eastern China is finally at an end.\n\nArguing that the time is ripe, Deng has advocated for a quick offensive, positioning well-prepared and trusted militia columns for a surgical strike to be carried out with minimal delay. Li Jishen and others, however, have advocated taking some time to coordinate with groups more loyal to Paris as well as rally previously disillusioned or sleeper cells.

Urgent messages have flown from the MinGan Insurgency to Shanghai and then to Paris: a final uprising is underway.\n\nWith communications delayed, there is little time to wait for a response. Discussions are underway on whether or not to commit every man to the front-lines of the forthcoming battle or to keep some in reserve. While the guerillas have proved effective in disrupting League control in MinGan, they have not always been particularly effective in the field - especially in pitched, conventional battles. Planners have argued that leaving some as flying columns will allow for logistical flexibility and reinforcements as the campaign unfolds.\n\nOthers warn however that this campaign is do or die, and this will likely be the last chance for socialism to organically take root. Holding back some units will encourage all the disparate cells to hold back for an imaginary fallback position, one that will hardly exist should this operation fail.

Now as Germany's capitalist order falters and Zhili authority has descended into chaos, it is our opportune moment to strike.

Many are connected to Qi's German-backed administration in Wuxi, or some of his old ties in his former stronghold of Shanghai. Of the latter camp comes many contacts in Shanghai's shadowy underworld, filled with often illicit dealings.\n\nA particularly ambitious name frequently comes to mind in Qi's circle, a rising star by the name of Dai Chunfeng. Most know him by his alias, Dai Li, whose contacts with unemployed Whampoa alumni and the Green Gang has made him invaluable as a smuggler, spy, and other nefarious activities. His organisation, a Green Gang splinter group known as the \"League of Ten\" is secretive, fraternal and nationalistic - traits not particularly uncommon in China's underworld - and not particularly trustworthy for that matter. Still, keeping some contact with them might just be the factor we need tilt the scales in our favour."

Very few remained loyal to the cause in MinGan, and fewer did not seek other ways to augment their income. In the days of insurgency, lines often blur between revolutionary and criminal.\n\nThe \"League of Ten\" is a small but growing bunch of gangsters made up of former Whampoa students, a splinter from Shanghai's Green Gang. Led by one Dai Chunfeng, like many Chinese gangs in this era they are fraternal, nationalistic, and secretive. Unlike others however, they retain some affinity for the Kuomintang cause, often a vital covert network for keeping our MinGan insurgency connected with the outside world.\n\nThat is hardly to say we have not been double-crossed before, or that the League is above playing both sides. Still, it appears that Dai has achieved a measure of prominence in wake of Sun Chuanfang's collapsing authority - shadowy agents have begun transmitting detailed (though sometimes exaggerated or out-of-date) information from Nanjing to our lines."

The bather thanked the teacher, and both men readily became friends - both grew up in Zhejiang, were trained to be educators, and above all shared an ambition to have more in life.\n\nThat is the (fanciful) story Dai Chunfeng tells people, for how he was rescued from embarrassment by Hu Zongnan. Although each went their separate ways afterwards, they coincidentally found each other again a few years later in Whampoa, as proteges of another Zhejiang-native: Chiang Kai-shek. Hu would graduate, Dai never finished his coursework, and both parted after 1927 only to once more find one another after the fall of the League.\n\nThe years have taken the toll on both men, hardly a year apart from one another. Neither feel that they received the respect they deserve in wake of the League War, Dai in particular is furious that despite his dangerous intelligence work before and during the war no one \"respectable\" is willing to associate with him.\n\nExcept, it would appear, for General Hu Zongnan. As Director of the Training Department, Hu has managed to retroactively secure Dai a diploma from Whampoa and formal membership in the Kuomintang. The ambitious general has recruited Dai to his personal staff, giving the man shelter from any reprisals for his work with Qi Xieyuan. The two men have vowed to become blood brothers, hatching backroom schemes for the future."

CHI.earlygame.100.t: "Revolutionary Times, Revolutionary Women"
CHI.earlygame.100.d: "The Chinese woman's role in the national revolution has long been a source of discussion within Kuomintang leadership, even from the earliest days of the party. Despite resistance from conservative elements, some women were enrolled in Whampoa's classes, even forming a Dare-to-Die unit during the Northern Expedition. Similarly, a Women's Institute of Political Training formally headed by Song Qingling was formed to facilitate female participation in China's future democracy.\n\nIn a dramatic fashion, the National Revolutionary Army has formally organised a new \"Red Detachment of Women\", one of the first large-scale units of its type. A brainchild of various military commanders and feminist figures, while it serves a heavily propagandised role unlike similar projects it is also expected to see actual combat. Less heralded, but also vital for the revolution is the tireless work of countless other women serving various integral roles both civilian and military in the revolutionary apparatus."

CHI.earlygame.100.b: "True liberation requires blood and steel!"

CHI.earlygame.101.t: "Hawaii's Ambivalence"
CHI.earlygame.101.d: "Across the sea, in Honolulu, sits perhaps the most reluctant faction still loyal to Wang's central committee. Led by Sun Fo, this faction of Kuomintang \"liberals\" remains on the fence, refusing to directly participate in the present revolt and just barely recognising Wang's leadership. Relations between the mainline leftist factions and the so-called \"Hawaii Clique\" have long since cooled as the RCA's \"Revolutionary Critic\" trades barbs with Hawaii's \"Reconstruction Review\" in scathing editorials.\n\nDespite this mutual animosity, Wang Jingwei has taken the initiative to try and bridge the divide. Sun's prestigious name aside, Hawaii's control over the Overseas Chinese Commission (OCC) gives them extensive contacts with the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, their liberal, moderate face gives them ready access to wealthy, nationalistic businessmen and intellectuals in China's coastal cities. One must ask however, how much ground is worth giving to extend an olive branch without compromising our revolutionary ideals."
CHI.earlygame.101.a: "We take what we can get."
CHI.earlygame.101.b: "Surely we can do more than that!"

CHI.earlygame.102.t: "The Kuomintang Asks for Aid!"
CHI.earlygame.102.d: "Since the National Revolutionary Army collapsed at the hands of the imperialist-backed Zhili Clique, we have certainly looked at the possibility of revolution in China with interest. China, while indeed not a capitalistic nation nor an industrial one, holds the potential for an anti-imperialist and socialist revolution, as evident by the role of the Chinese mass movement in the Northern Expedition.\n\nWhile Chinese socialists and the Kuomintang attempted to stage a bold but failed uprising in 1932, it would appear that following the collapse of the capitalistic world order after Black Monday - the Chinese Kuomintang and the NRA have risen once more to break their chains. We have received an urgent communique from our Chinese connections, such as Chairman Wang Jingwei and ambassador Eugene Chen for our nation to send over military arms and advisors to help the Kuomintang in their renewed revolutionary struggle. We can certainly support them, although, given the distance of the conflict and our limited resources, we can either send them purely advisors or both advisors and rifles. Alternatively, some in our government have argued that instead, we should only send them our thoughts and prayers."

With this gracious act of help, we will surely be able to achieve victory in the ongoing League War and free the Yangtze of the imperialists once and for all."

CHI.earlygame.105.d: "Our cries for help have sadly gone unanswered as [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has announced that they will be neutral in observing the ongoing conflict in China. As such, they have refused to send us military advisors and weapons citing their own needs in preparation for growing conflict in Europe. We will have to carry on without their help."

CHI.earlygame.106.t: "Collapse of the NRA"
CHI.earlygame.106.d: "For years, the NRA had been fighting a war of resistance against the corrupt capitalistic imperialists of the League of Eight Provinces following the failure of the Northern Expedition. While the NRA launched a second abortive uprising in 1932, for many - a new opportunity came with the collapse of the league during the arrival of Black Monday in China.\n\nNonetheless, despite the valiant attempts of the NRA to defeat their enemies in the chaotic League War, it would appear that the strength and morale of the National Revolutionary Army has effectively been crushed on the battlefield. With more of his forces fleeing the battlefield day after day, Chairman [CHI.GetLeader] must quickly seek to reorganise his forces for one last ditch attempt lest the KMT find themselves truly crushed forevermore."

CHI.earlygame.200.t: "Return of the Central Committee"
CHI.earlygame.200.d: "After a long and tension-filled voyage, the flotilla of ships from the Internationale finally arrived in China. In a daring operation, using a mixture of subterfuge and apt planning, they successfully evaded interception by hostile ships in part because of the ongoing fallout of the mutiny in Mawei and the recent defection of critical Fujian naval forces led by Chen Shaokuan and Chen Jiliang.\n\nAt long last, the Central Committee is able to step foot on Chinese soil once more since their exile in 1927. Owing to the ongoing fighting near the recently secured port of Xiamen, Wang Jingwei kept his remarks brief and with little pomp, though the mood at the ceremony was nonetheless one of great excitement. He and other members of the Paris-based committee quickly met with the leaders of MinGan to establish a working government, and have been remarkably amiable with one another despite lingering differences.\n\nAlso disembarking is a formation of European-trained Chinese forces, carrying a sizeable amount of successfully transported artillery. Trained overseas in their Whampoa-in-exile, they are led by Deputy Headmaster Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Political Department Zhou Enlai, and Director of the Training Department Hu Zongnan. The last officer of note is Admiral Li Zhilong, who has been commended for his capable naval leadership throughout the operation."
CHI.earlygame.200.a: "Welcome back Chairman Wang!"

CHI.earlygame.201.t: "Incidents in Wenzhou"
CHI.earlygame.201.d: "Occupation plans for Wenzhou and the other A.O.G. ports have been severely lacking compared to the meticulous steps and lines of advance drawn around Xiamen. When NRA forces occupied the city of Wenzhou, spontaneous anti-foreign riots began all across the city, leading to the murders of numerous German residents and the looting of much of the city's uptown districts. To complicate matters, several smaller advance groups of Nationalist troops also participated in the looting until more disciplined units arrived to secure the area. Wenzhou is now significantly damaged from the civil unrest."
CHI.earlygame.201.a: "Another mess for our foreign secretary to sort out."

CHI.earlygame.202.t: "Tragedy in Nantong"
CHI.earlygame.202.d: "The port of Nantong had been leased by the League of Eight Provinces to the A.O.G., and its position at the mouth of the Yangtze allowed it to act as a German-exclusive alternative to the International City of Shanghai. The advancement of the NRA towards the treaty port caused mass panic and unrest among many of its residents. Widespread looting by Chinese natives combined with scorched-earth tactics by German security forces have lit up the sky above Nantong, and the ensuing fires have wiped out many of the textile factories. An exodus of ferries heading south towards Shanghai were overcrowded and unsuited to trips outside the Yangtze, leading to several of the boats capsizing with hundreds of deaths reported. Before the NRA could do anything to control the situation, it became clear that Nantong was a disaster area. Long seen as an exemplar of how Chinese cities could be modernised, Nantong has effectively been sacked."
CHI.earlygame.202.a: "A great loss for the country."

CHI.earlygame.203.t: "Fujianese in Hangzhou"
CHI.earlygame.203.d: "Most of the National Revolutionary Army's first units were raised in Fujian Province from local peasants and the rare urban native, and few if any of these regular troops are familiar with the standard Mandarin dialect. Yesterday a group of Fujianese soldiers on leave in Hangzhou caused a scene when language difficulties and drunkenness led to a fight with local Hangzhou residents. Despite the view of China as one nation, language difficulties and the sharp contrast between rural and urban lifestyles will make stationing most units outside of their home areas difficult."
CHI.earlygame.203.a: "It's an unavoidable problem of national unification."

CHI.earlygame.204.t: "A New Dawn in Nanjing"
CHI.earlygame.204.d: "Nanjing has been liberated. Gone are the warlords, Sun Chuanfang and Qi Xieyuan, the tyrants who stole from the people and sold the city to Imperialists. At long last, the White Sun flies above the city - the dream of the Northern Expedition nearly a decade ago. In a speech today following the city's capture, a triumphant ceremony honoured the late party founder and all the revolutionary martyrs that have fallen over the years.\n\nMore practically, it is clear that the Kuomintang intend to turn Nanjing into their provisional capital for the duration of the national revolution. Already, the former Governor-General's palace (and the same building where Dr. Sun was sworn in as provisional president in 1911) has been converted into a provisional Presidential Palace.\n\nA provisional Executive Yuan is being established as well, subordinate to the Central Executive Committee, with Wang Jingwei as the President of the National Government. Liao Zhongkai has been appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan, a new position to serve as head of the Kuomintang government. It appears that Kuomintang have begun their first forays into ruling an organised state."

CHI.midgame.000.t: "Victory in the League War"
CHI.midgame.000.d: "For many outside observers of the tumultuous Chinese political situation since the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, the Chinese Nationalist Party's pursuits of national unification were thoroughly quashed with the failure of the Northern Expedition. The Kuomintang movement, which splintered into competing factions, seemed destined for failure.\n\nFollowing the collapse of Zhili authority in the League of Eight Provinces following Black Monday; it would appear that the Kuomintang has surpassed these odds and has re-emerged as a vibrant political force. Years of biding their time in Europe and the MinGan Insurgent Zone has bore fruit, as guerrilla soldiers and militia of the resurgent National Revolutionary Army have won victory after victory against their adversaries. With the conflict's conclusion in Eastern China, the time has come to rebuild the provinces and heal from the scars of war. For observers within the Internationale, it would appear that their sponsorship of the Kuomintang has finally yielded its reward, as calls have gone out to rally the Kuomintang movement once more to unify and save China from her strife."

###Section 2a (000-199): Political Content

#1st Congress Event Chain
CHI.midgame.001.t: "Opening of the First Repatriated Congress of the Kuomintang"
CHI.midgame.001.d: "Having been ousted from the politics of China for more than a decade now, the Kuomintang's recent victory over its enemies in the League War has seen Sun Yat-sen's idea for a national revolution revived once more. Once the home of the Ming emperors, the Provisional Presidential Palace (which had been used as the seat of power for Sun Chuanfang's autocratic rule over the Eight Provinces) - has now been renovated into the Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Government. News of the Kuomintang's First Repatriated Congress is beginning to spread across China, rallying like-minded revolutionaries in a common goal to fulfil the dream of the Northern Expedition and create a modern and just Republic of China.\n\nIn addition, a delegation from the Third Internationale will also be in attendance at the Congress. Having long pledged their support to the Kuomintang since the Party's initial reorganisation in 1924, the Central Committee has long played exile in Paris and owes its remarkable success to the backing of the two major syndicalist nations of Europe. The cordial entourage includes the French syndicalist advisors André Malraux and Jean Fontenoy, the British advisor David Ramsay, the Indian socialist M.N. Roy, the Norwegian syndicalist Ingvald Berentin Aase, and various volunteer advisors from primarily the French and British militaries who have pledged their services to develop the National Revolutionary Army. Nonetheless, these foreign observers could certainly see that notable \"factions\" or \"cliques\" were beginning to form within the Congress ranks - those who fought for Song Qingling's populist government and those that returned home from the syndicalist new order.\n\nChairman Wang Jingwei stood behind a grandiose portrait of Sun Yat-sen flanked by the Party's flag and the NRA's flag as he began his speech to inaugurate the Congress. Perhaps to acknowledge the absence of the Party's right wing, he started with a passionate appeal that, from a revolutionary anti-imperialist standpoint, the true revolutionaries were to come from the Kuomintang's Left. And thus, the First Repatriated Congress began in earnest - the ecstatic revolutionary mood of Nanjing reminded many of the same patriotic fervour that had captured Guangzhou in 1924."
CHI.midgame.001.a: "Let's get started right away!"

CHI.midgame.002.t: "Determining the Class Base of the Party"
CHI.midgame.002.d: "The Congress' first tenet was to address the Kuomintang's utmost duty to uplift the oppressed workers and peasants of China. In the spirit of the first Reorganisation, the Kuomintang was to awaken the masses and to unite together the peasants, workers, merchants, and students in order to defeat their shared enemies - the imperialists and warlords.\n\nWithin conservative elements especially the elders of the Party, the Kuomintang should represent \"the whole people\" during the National Revolution, the elder Wu Zhihui even argued that good landlords and merchants could join the revolution alongside the masses. Taking to the stand after Wang's speech, RCA members Chen Gongbo and Shi Cuntong took to the floor to argue that class however was the \"most important question in revolution\", and that class struggle was a necessary evolution of the Chinese revolution. Citing the efforts of Song Qingling's peasants in the MinGan insurgency and the strikes of 1932, Shi and Chen blasted Wu by citing a former saying from Sun in which the party's founder said the National Revolution should accomplish socialism.\n\nWhile a definitive class base was drawn by both Song's populists and Wang's growing RCA faction in that the Kuomintang is to indeed henceforth be a party of workers and peasants, foreign observers have certainly noticed factional tensions rising beneath the facade of party unity. The RCA after all believe that a revolutionary cadre must lead the masses, a move that many in Song Qingling's Provisional Action Committee find offence at - as they do not see a revolution of the masses led by a pretentious elite."
CHI.midgame.002.a: "The KMT is the Party of the Workers and Peasants!"

CHI.midgame.003.t: "Return of the Reconstruction Faction"
CHI.midgame.003.d: "The leftist dominated Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang's reputation as the \"legitimate\" and \"heir\" of the Chinese Nationalist Party that had collapsed in the First Northern Expedition has nonetheless attracted the interest of various centrists and liberals. These men, who tended to waver in their alignment with the Kuomintang's right and left wings prior to the expedition's failure, distrust the outwardly socialist development of the party across the last decade.\n\nMany of these republicans chose to flee overseas for the United States, Hawaii, and Southeast Asia where they made up the Overseas Commission of the Chinese Kuomintang, an extension of Kuomintang interests far away from China itself. Led primarily by Sun Fo, the son of the Party's founder, these centrists have been invited to participate in the First Repatriated Congress and Sun Fo has been graciously offered a seat on the Central Executive Committee.\n\nThey are also joined by the military officers who served in India during the Kuomintang's exile, generals Xue Yue and Zhang Fakui who claimed to be apolitical although they certainly would view the syndicalists as a persistent potential threat. As such, the combination of this India Clique and the former Overseas Chinese Commission has led to the formation of the so called \"Reconstruction Faction\", which based on Sun Fo's own words is to rebuild or reconstruct the Kuomintang Party without resorting to the radical methods of Reorganisation."
CHI.midgame.003.a: "Interesting..."

CHI.midgame.004.t: "Tensions within the League of Chinese Syndicalists"
CHI.midgame.004.d: "The proclamation of a new revolutionary and socialist Chinese government has led to a growing sense of excitement and patriotism within the Chinese left-wing. The conglomerate of socialist thinkers, intellectuals, and writers who are not party members of the Chinese Kuomintang have formed the fragile coalition of the League of Chinese Syndicalists (LCS), the largest faction of which is the Chinese Syndicalist Party.\n\nTensions have nonetheless begun to emerge between the LCS. Ideologically, not all socialists in the LCS adhere to the belief that China is already in a capitalistic society. A young generation of radical socialists called the \"Radical Faction\" of the LCS has declared that Chinese society is already in a capitalistic mode of production and that both peasants and workers are constrained in a system of capitalism, a system that must be destroyed by the revolution. Older conservative members of the LCS such as Dong Biwu and Lin Boqu, \"the Orthodox Faction\", have instead voiced for cooperation with the Chinese Kuomintang and many of them adhere to the belief that China is still a semi-feudal nation.\n\nSeparate from the CSP's radical and orthodox wings is the \"World Society\", a generation of old and idealistic anarchists who believe in the Proudhonist ideals of class reconciliation and universal harmony. Represented by party elders such as Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, Zhang Renjie, and Cai Yuanpei, they absolutely abhor and fear the class conflict stoked by radical members of the RCA or those within the LCS."
CHI.midgame.004.a: "Under the socialist flag, we shall free China!"

CHI.midgame.005.t: "The Question of Ethnic Autonomy"
CHI.midgame.005.d: "Ethnic relations within China have not always been peaceful. But it was the great Dr. Sun Yat-sen who theorised that the notion of Minzu from the Three Principles of the People was necessary to prevent the nation from falling into disorder and chaos. Interestingly enough, his earlier opinions seemed to encourage the notion of a dominant Han ethnicity. But as evident from his declaration at the 1924 reorganisation of the Kuomintang, Sun proclaimed that the Kuomintang's anti-imperialist mission also included securing self-determination for all \"domestic minzu.\" But the notion of Minzu itself is disputed as Sun considers the great races of Qing China (aside from the Han majority), the Tibetans, Mongols, Manchus, and Hui, as mere relics of an ancient social structure.\n\nInstead, the late premier's stance was that the Minzu of China were all subordinate to the ethnically dominant \"Hanzu\" (Han ethnicity). It was, therefore, the more cultured and sophisticated Hanzu's destiny to lead the Minzu into the evolutionary formation of a single Han Zhonghua Minzu. In the National Revolution, all notions of self-determination were to be suspended until the period of tutelage is passed as the country's Minzu are merely inept to rule themselves.\n\nThe Repatriated Congress, in particular Wang Jingwei's faction, is mostly in favour of following Sun's principles. Nonetheless, the Provisional Action Committee has voiced openly that they would be more than happy to promise a degree of self-autonomy for the minorities, provided they support the KMT of course. While a Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has been formed, the official doctrine of the said department is to train these peoples to adopt the revolutionary spirit of the superior Hanzu Kuomintang. But until the warlords and imperialists have been comprehensively defeated, the question of ethnic minorities shall remain indisputably answered by only the Kuomintang."
CHI.midgame.005.a: "We'll give it some thought."

CHI.midgame.006.t: "The Closing of the Congress"
CHI.midgame.006.d: "After several weeks of long deliberations, the Second Repatriated Congress of the Kuomintang has formally adjourned. Although much had been decided upon, there were plenty left unresolved and subtle fractures have begun to form between Wang's loyalists and his divided opposition. In the meantime, as delegates and representatives prepare to head on home, they have decided to entrust the third and latest Central Executive Committee to manage party affairs.\n\nHeaded by Chairman Wang Jingwei and Vice Chairman Liao Zhongkai, the two are joined by twenty-two others: Bai Yunti, Chen Gongbo, Chen Youren, Deng Yanda, Dong Biwu, Gu Mengyu, Li Jishen, Lin Boqu, Liang Hancao, Pan Yuanchao, Peng Zemin, Shi Cuntong, Song Qingling, Song Ziwen, Sun Fo, Wang Faqin, Wu Chaoshu, Xu Deheng, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Yunchuan, Zeng Xing, and Zhu Jiqing.\n\nGiven disciplinary powers and with say over financial affairs is the Central Supervisory Committee, made up of Kuomintang stalwarts Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, Xu Qian and Zhang Renjie. Both committees also have extensive and carefully negotiated alternative member rosters.\n\nA delicate balance of power has been erected, with Wang and his RCA carefully moving to consolidate his government without provoking excessive backlash from those increasingly antagonised by his efforts to assert his authority. Perhaps best encapsulating the emerging power games being played is Wang's decision to appoint Sun Fo as Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan (a new prestigious but rather powerless position), to help remove a rival from loyalist Chen Gongbo's bid to become Premier of the Legislative Yuan. Although the full cabinet is yet to be named, Song Qingling and her PAC allies are said to be already grumbling about a lack of representation, feeling deliberately locked out, however it is unlikely that they can do much to contest the President's appointments."
CHI.midgame.006.a: "Or can they?..."

CHI.midgame.007.t: "The China Revival Society"
CHI.midgame.007.d: "As Kuomintang representatives assembled and politicked in Nanjing, plenty left outside the negotiating table found time to gather on their own. Away from the public spotlight, a different set of ideas and ideals swirled.\n\nMany disaffected Whampoa alumni, stewing in exile far from home across the last decade, had gathered together within the academy's tightly woven networks. The more ideological and radical of this bunch turn to He Zhonghan and Deng Wenyi, mid-level staff officers who promote a nationalistic, totalist, and anti-establishment line. Having returned, they have proudly begun calling their secret fraternity the Revolutionary Army Comrades Association (RACA).\n\nA secret circle within a larger secret circle, they nervously presented their ideas before Hu Zongnan, the Director of Whampoa's Training Department, and other sympathetic commanders in a backroom-meeting. Although short by stature, Hu is one of the eldest of Whampoa's first graduating class (age 28 in 1924) and a favourite of the former Headmaster (who preferred Zhejiang natives), elements he has exploited to assert an air of authority over many of his peers and students.\n\nTo the delight of the attendees, Hu gave his approval for the RACA's agenda before his fellow \"young guard\" officers and formally accepted his role as their Lingxiu. In his speech, the General swore to ensure the Chinese revolution will never again be the victim of foreign imperialists or petty infighting. Wielding the RACA, the League of Ten, and other radical officers together into one fighting movement, the China Revival Society is born."
CHI.midgame.007.a: "A revolution from within?"

CHI.midgame.008.t: "The Death of Liao Zhongkai"
CHI.midgame.008.d: "Tragedy struck the Kuomintang last week, as one of its pivotal figures is laid to rest. Liao Zhongkai was a founding member of the Kuomintang and at least titularly the second highest ranking member of the party-state. Widely respected among the left, he has continued to nurse lasting wounds from a brutal assassination attempt in 1925. It seems that he has finally succumbed to those wounds, though thankfully lived long enough to see the party return from its exile.\n\nAs his funeral concludes near Nanjing, his personal effects are not the only things being divided. Following a tradition set by Dr. Sun himself, his wife He Xiangning (herself a prominent revolutionary) has taken his Central Executive Committee seat. The position of Vice Chairman of the CEC, a position specially created for him during the exile period, has gone to Song Qingling - helping preserve the balance of power within the party.\n\nRemaining in contention however, is the title of Premier of the Executive Yuan. The nominal head of the executive branch, it was freshly created during the League War as a replacement for the old Beiyang prime minister. Liao hardly had any time to utilise it however, leaving executive power effectively in the hands of the nominally weak Presidency. To Wang, the job was meant as a means of personally recognising Liao's contributions. To his rivals in the PAC, it represented a necessary counterweight to the Chairman as Liao was seen as more conciliatory.\n\nWang is determined to avoid having to split executive prerogatives, fearing the perils of a powerless President vulnerable to political machinations. As President of the Republic, it is in his right to appoint the Premier, and Chen Gongbo is the most logical candidate. A loyal protege, friend, and the leader of the RCA, his candidacy is troubled by his personal radicalism and the fact that Wang needs him elsewhere. The alternative is for Wang to abolish the Premiership and incorporate it into the Presidency, certain to cause alarm. Whatever he decides, his choice will cast a long shadow, setting a precedent for the future for Presidential-Premier relationships in the Republic."
CHI.midgame.008.a: "Appoint Chen Gongbo to replace him."
CHI.midgame.008.b: "Fold the Premiership back into the Presidency."

CHI.midgame.009.t: "The Wrath of the Party"
CHI.midgame.009.d: "Backlash against Wang Jingwei's \"tyranny\" has been swift and unexpectedly brutal. Factions from across the political spectrum have condemned Wang's move to absorb the Premiership of the Executive Yuan. His blunder is highlighted by the fact that it is not only the PAC and RF that have decried the move - many of the RCA's Moderates have been enraged and driven closer to the PAC's camp. Even among the RCA's radicals, there has been some stir, with Chen Gongbo rumoured to be fuming at Wang's decision to pass him over for the job.\n\nCaucuses within the Kuomintang are not well-defined, with the state being officially one party and factionalism de jure banned. But it certainly has not been good for Wang's camp - with blood now in the water and the Chairman appearing vulnerable for the first time, many have come out to knock him down a peg. Any attempt to force his resignation is unlikely to succeed at this juncture, but he has hurried to try and salvage the situation by tentatively offering to appoint Gu Mengyu, the most prominent RCA-Moderate leader, as his Premier in exchange for a political truce.\n\nThe onus now lies in the PAC to make their move. Word of this offer has quickly leaked and spread, though for Song Qingling and her allies it might not be good enough. Having an RCA member in the position would be a victory for the Chairman regardless and with his statesmanship he'll likely reconcile the Moderates soon enough. But openly holding out until a candidate from their quasi-illegal opposition camp may disgust the wavering RCA-Moderates, turning their anger towards PAC obstructionism and validating Wang's fears of partisanship. The party's future hangs in the balance."
CHI.midgame.009.a: "Confirming Gu as Premier will soothe tempers."
CHI.midgame.009.b: "Double down against the cornered Chairman."

CHI.midgame.010.t: "The Limits of Power"
CHI.midgame.010.d: "Ever since Dr. Sun declared himself Generalissimo and the Kuomintang lurched towards a vanguardist direction, questions of constitutionalism, checks and balances, and power sharing have always been a sore spot for the ostensibly democratic party. His often bickering successors have not helped their case, struggling to keep the party together even with such extra-constitutional powers.\n\nWang Jingwei is the latest to assert his unchecked authority for the duration of the political tutelage. And with the Premiership crisis having failed to be quietly resolved within the halls of power, it has since reached the ears of the public. As the scandal continues to dog the party, support has largely bottomed out as the people return to their usual apathy - the KMT are little better than the squabbling Beiyang politicians.\n\nBack in the CEC, the stand-off between RCA and PAC oriented factions continues. Sun Fo and the Reconstruction Faction, whether because of political shrewdness or fears of instability, have offered to break from the PAC-lead blockade. Sun Fo, already Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan (a position created for him), has \"generously\" offered to become Premier with Gu Mengyu as his deputy. This would hardly fix the underlying problems that the dispute has exposed, but with the PAC showing no indications of giving up, this will at least allow Wang to move on for now.\n\nDiscarding this chance to \"off-ramp\" is not an ideal option either. Throughout this crisis, Wang has been forced to acknowledge the Premiership as at least a distinct job albeit with ambiguous powers and given up from directly abolishing it. Chen Gongbo, slighted but still loyal, has concocted a plan with the reluctant assent of the RCA-Moderates - tired of the unabating crisis. Wang will appoint himself as Premier, holding the Presidency and Premiership simultaneously during the tutelage. The RCA will use every dirty trick in their arsenal to ram it through the provisional legislature and Wang use his powers as commander-in-chief to silence dissent. Their bluff called, the PAC will be forced to fold for the sake of the nation."
CHI.midgame.010.a: "At least we can try and mend things now..."

CHI.midgame.011.d: "While denounced as an autocratic clique, the Chairman of the Kuomintang Wang Jingwei's camp boasts one of the largest factions within the Party. Those that make up his support base within the government include both the Residence Faction and the Reorganised Comrades Association (RCA). As such his \"clique\" features its own internal power struggle, as the various factions vy for Wang's favour and approval.\n\nThe Residence Faction (derisively called the Palace Faction by Wang's critics), are those who reside with the Chairman in his mansion. The main voice of the Residence Faction is none other than Wang's wife, the ambitious and strong-willed Chen Bijun - who is nicknamed by those within the RCA as \"Wang Furen\" (Madame Wang) or \"Laotaipo\" (the old woman, due to her looking older than her husband). A loving couple, she often has her husband's ear and protects his interests even when he is unwilling to do so himself. Additional members of this faction include Chu Minyi (married to Chen Bijun's adopted sister), Zeng Zhongming (Wang's most trusted secretary), Zeng Xing (Zeng Zhongming's sister), Wang Wenxun (Wang Jingwei's third daughter), and Chen Yaozu (Chen Bijun's brother). They are also joined by Wang Qi and Wang Zongzun (Wang's nephews) and Chen Chunpu (Chen Bijun's nephew).\n\nBitterly opposing the Chairman's wife is none other than the Chairman's beloved friend - Chen Gongbo, who is the de-facto voice of the RCA - Wang's political followers in the KMT. Nonetheless, Chen and his followers form the Radical wing of the RCA, his pro-authoritarian materialist stances are joined in conjunction with his belief that class war is inevitable in China. He is joined by followers such as Shi Cuntong, Wang Faqin, Liu Kanyuan, Gu Zhengang, and Gu Zhengding.\n\nThose who refuse to adopt Chen's Marxist-oriented world-view and are generally more moderate in their discourse, are the RCA-Moderates led by Gu Mengyu. While a significantly smaller faction, Gu nonetheless holds influence as being one of Wang's most favourite writers and the Moderates themselves agree that a Reorganisation of the Kuomintang is needed to purify the revolution. Joining Gu in the Moderate camp are Pan Yuanchao, Wang Leping, Lin Bosheng, and Zhu Jiqing."

CHI.midgame.012.d: "\"We should follow Dr. Sun's Principles. What we need now is action and the people to take action,\" announced Song Qingling at the creation of the Provisional Action Committee (PAC). A development of the earlier populist MinGan Government, the PAC is devoted to the cause of establishing a socialist and free China - one devoid of imperialism, warlords, and greedy landlords.\n\nTo the PAC, the Chinese revolution is complex, with the revolutionary characteristics of a military rebellion, of civil rights, of democracy, and of socialism. Members of PAC adhere to the Marxist ideas of historical materialism, they are convinced that China is headed towards a socialist future and that the common people (pingmin) would assume leadership in this new order. The society of the future would be built on the active participation of the masses of common people. Due to the complex nature of PAC's beliefs, they maintain a shaky relationship with the Reconstruction Faction, the World Society, the Chinese Syndicalist Party, and even members of Wang Jingwei's Reorganised Comrades Association.\n\nWhile PAC members agree with the Reconstruction Faction (RF) on the nature of eventual democracy, to them the RF is nothing more than the representation of bourgeoisie interests which will tarnish the actual revolution that is to be led by the Chinese commoners. They see those in the RCA as mere lackeys to an authoritarian Chairman, and while they indeed hold similar grass-roots and socialist views as their syndicalist and anarchist counterparts, more conservative PAC members have reservations regarding the Third Internationale's role in the world revolution.\n\nLed by the dynamic Deng Yanda and the charismatic widow Madame Song Qingling, the PAC does not advocate orthodox Sunism but rather the improvement and development the Three Principles of the People to make them more concrete and practical to meet the needs of the people. Their intellectual flexibility is what allows them to court these various factions, from syndicalists to liberals, while also maintaining their own goal of a democratic and socialist China."

CHI.midgame.013.d: "As the largest faction and movement within the League of Chinese Syndicalists, the Chinese Syndicalist Party boasts the most union membership and followers in China. With inspiration from the glorious revolutions of Britain and France following the Great War, the Old Guard of the Chinese Syndicalists such as party members Chen Duxiu, Li Lisan, and Liu Shaoqi believe that in order for the proletarian socialist revolution to happen - the national revolution must be won first. When the Kuomintang was reorganised in 1924, the syndicalists and the Kuomintang worked together in a pledge of unity - the so called United Front.\n\nIdeally the Orthodox Syndicalists of the CSP envision a system akin to the Commune of France, with unions and councils working together in tandem. The ongoing civic and political turmoil of the French state however has led to doubts towards the leadership of the orthodox CSP. Within the LCS, criticism has come from groups ranging from the anarchists to the Radical Faction of the CSP, regarding cooperation with the Chinese Kuomintang. To Chen Duxiu, the \"all-class\" revolution is the only form of revolution possible for the proletariat at this stage in time.\n\nThe policy of the United Front had been successful in organising both the failed 1932 Shanghai Uprising and the NRA's success in the League War. Nonetheless, the Orthodox Faction find themselves pulled at the hems with the Kuomintang's own factional struggle splitting the LCS' tense coalition. There is little doubt that the elders of the World Society are certainly closer to the PAC in beliefs and that the Radicals of the CSP find common ground with the radicals of the RCA. As the LCS begins to unravel into infighting once more, the Orthodox Faction has a choice: to side with one of the major factions of the Kuomintang, or to continue their course of independence from Nationalist party politics."

CHI.midgame.014.t: "A Midnight Meeting"
CHI.midgame.014.d: "In the dead of night, near a discreet villa, a young and somewhat inebriated officer approaches. He is a faceless man, deliberately wearing a drab, monotonous outfit calculated to prevent the man from standing out as he conducts the \"labour of hound and horse\" as he so calls it. He carries with him a proposition from his master.\n\nInside is one of the fledging Republic's most eminent figures, perhaps the third most influential figure in the old MinGan insurgency. The circumstances are grim and he shoos out his hand-picked guards from the meeting room. He is not fooled by his guest's act, watching the man's wolfish eyes dart around for weakness as he speaks.\n\nIn the paranoid atmosphere that permeates the land, conspiracies and furtive meetings are all too common. But this perhaps eclipses all others in its scale - a plot against the leader of the very party they claim to serve. Dai Chunfeng, the guest, begins by reminding General Deng Yanda of their common struggle together in the insurgency, which soon devolves into a rant about how the Paris Committee has swooped in to steal all the glory despite hiding in safety for nearly a decade. He insists he and other officers are willing to fight to protect the revolution from Wang's folly and proposes an alliance with unspecified conditions against him. He is already armed with potential areas of coordination between their respective factions.\n\nDeng is quick to show his annoyance at Dai equating his efforts to those of the insurgency barely concealing his disdain for the former gangster. He is well aware who Dai serves - Hu Zongnan and his clique have long been undermining Deng's authority within the army. But as the Chairman's power grows, the threat of tyranny hangs over the nation and there is some temptation towards the use of \"special methods\" to keep the RCA at bay. As the veteran general stares down the \"officer\" who failed to graduate Whampoa with flaring contempt, he nonetheless contemplates his own labour of hound and horse for Song Qingling and the PAC."
CHI.midgame.014.a: "A deal in the dark is signed."
CHI.midgame.014.b: "Extremism is kept at bay."

CHI.midgame.015.t: "Moves and Countermoves"
CHI.midgame.015.d: "The hound has long slipped from its leash, a fact that many within the Kuomintang central leadership have come to regret. The National Revolutionary Army, a force designed specifically to protect the party from warlord and military control, has slowly developed a mind of its own, and rumours of military conspiracies swirl as each faction courts sympathetic officers.\n\nWang Jingwei is no stranger to this threat, and neither are those closest to him. Although Wang has substantial control over the bureaucracy, the support of at the least plurality of intellectuals and Chen Gongbo has whipped his RCA into a disciplined (albeit unofficial) caucus, his position at the top of the party has never felt quite secure.\n\nHis wife, Chen Bijun, has a plan. A determined woman, with painful memories of the power-struggle her husband had with Chiang Kai-shek, knows all too well the power of the military in dictating party priorities. She has independently begun the legwork for creating a pro-Chairman military faction, something that she has finally informed Wang in detail. With the help of Zhang Zhizhong, Zhou Enlai, and the advisors of the MMIC, she has drafted a list of members of the Political Department, the European-trained syndicalist officers, and other young guard loyalists to install into key positions in the NRA hierarchy.\n\nSuch blatant meddling in the army might be just enough to bring the military to heel, breaking their independent political spirit. On the other hand, Wang is hesitant despite Chen's rosy outlook, noting that many NRA officers are genuinely apolitical and such open demands of political loyalty may backfire by driving them into the opposition. Chen's open efforts to install her brother Chen Changzu as a general in the air force has caused plenty of blowback in the past. Presenting an image of being a respectable statesman above such petty bickering might be the better route to keep his power. Then again, revolution is often a dirty business and as President and Commander-in-Chief it is his right to grant military commissions. Perhaps it is better to be feared than overthrown."

CHI.midgame.016.t: "The Four Elders Denounce Wang"
CHI.midgame.016.d: "Long respected amongst Chinese leftists for organising Chinese workers and students in the Diligent Work-Study Programme, the Four Elders of the Kuomintang hold an eclectic view of anarchism and its role within the Kuomintang. Li Shizeng, one of the Elders of the World Society, has proposed that the Kuomintang adopt a federation based on Proudhon's principle - this federation would be a combination of local and central governments with the goal of decentralising power to regional bodies. However, given the political situation of China, a degree of central authority (military power, finances, and heavy industries) would still be in government hands until anarchism was achieved.\n\nThe anarchists of the Kuomintang aim to construct a Labour University akin to those in Europe, where a new kind of labour leader and intellectual would be created - legendary organisers who would transform not just the Party but rather the nation. With the help of their newspaper, \"Revolutionary Weekly\", they would propagate anarchist ideals and argue that Sun's Three Principles of the People was by default - a way to create anarchism.\n\nIn the latest article of Revolutionary Weekly, the fiery elder Wu Zhihui denounced Chairman Wang and the RCA for \"inciting class struggle\", arguing that Dr. Sun's revolution called for all of China to rise up - as evident by the declaration made in the First Congress of 1924. To Wu, the revolution was \"quanmin geming\" (revolution for all people). However, RCA members have denounced this terminology on the basis that it is used by the counter-revolutionary Chinese Youth Party in the North. To the RCA, by using counter-revolutionary language - Wu assented the repudiation of social transformation as part of the National Revolution, which was considered ironic for an anarchist.\n\nFurther criticism has come from Chen Gongbo, who has decided to draft an open letter to the Revolutionary Weekly. In his letter, he argued that the World Society seemed to enjoy their official positions as elders within the Party and spent most of their time courting the influential military leaders of the Provisional Action Committee. To Wu and Li Shizeng, whom he once may have idolised, he has growing doubts about their commitment to the revolution - especially with regard to their lack of belief in class struggle. The only solution, according to him, was for them to resign their positions immediately and for the rest of the KMT to dismiss their ideas as folly."
CHI.midgame.016.a: "The Elders make fair points!"
CHI.midgame.016.b: "They need to get with the times."

CHI.midgame.017.t: "Hot off the Presses"
CHI.midgame.017.d: "Within the Party, one of the most common means of inter-factional bickering comes in newspapers and pamphlets from respective cliques to demonstrate their supposedly better understanding of Chinese society and history. Of the most popular newspapers read by Party members are Chen Gongbo's \"The Revolutionary Critic,\" Gu Mengyu's \"Advance,\" and Sun Fo's \"Reconstruction Review.\"\n\nChen Gongbo's Revolutionary Critic features a collaboration of writers within the RCA's most radical wings, including Shi Cuntong, Guo Chuntao, and Xu Deheng. Their writings mainly deal with their desire to see the Party reorganised and restructured once more, a more complete \"Reorganisation\" than the 1924 party reshuffle. To them, the revolution must be led by cadre of revolutionary intellectuals, and the masses must be drawn  as they are the true vanguard of the national revolution. The Critic's writings deal with mostly scientific and Marxist terms, with writers like Chen frequently using words such as materialism to dictate their thought processes.\n\nGu Mengyu's \"Advance\" shows that Gu and his followers were well-read on Marxism, but they rejected the notion that Marxism was scientific or historical - instead they call  for a similar reorganisation expressed by Chen and his followers but with less radical means. To Gu, there is no need for a \"class base\" of the Party as Chinese society had not yet developed into a class society - instead, the KMT should represent \"all oppressed peoples.\"\n\nSun Fo's Reconstruction Review differed in the Reorganisationists in that the writers of the Review argue that the KMT should not be reorganised but rather reconstructed. To these writers, the KMT has been tainted since the United Front, and the RCA-Radicals merely echoed the tenets of Marxism rather than adhering to the orthodox theory of Sun Yat-sen. Furthermore, they also disagree with PAC, seeing PAC's populism and PAC's flexibility in working with syndicalists as a potential threat to the National Revolution's success."

CHI.midgame.018.t: "The Yiguandao Intrigue"
CHI.midgame.018.d: "Members of the Kuomintang have been on edge as of late as the years flow by and the revolution continues. Infighting among party cadres has long been accepted as a political reality, though at times it can reach the point of paranoia. Accusations of reactionary thought or subverting the Three Principles is unfortunately common practice, but now it seems like a new round of hysteria is starting.\n\nAlthough the Yiguandao movement may be associated with Shandong province, its adherents can be found throughout China. At the 1929 Party Congress, the Kuomintang resolved that none of its members could also belong to any charismatic spiritual movements, chief among them being the cult lead by Mad Mystic Zhang Tianran. Spurred on by a rumour, an extensive counter-intelligence sweep has ensnared one secret Millenarian of high party status: Zhou Fohai.\n\nZhou is a friend and close associate of Wang Jingwei, and it is sometimes said that his government runs on \"Chen Gongbo's mouth, Zhou Fohai's pen and Chu Minyi's legs\". Despite this, he is personally unpopular within Wang's camp, not a devout member of the RCA and estranged from the Residence Faction, and said to be disillusioned with socialism. As word spreads, the PAC has worked to spin it to their advantage, insinuating that Wang has allowed treason to flourish right under his nose.\n\nZhou for his part has thoroughly denied any wrongdoing and claims he has ended his association with the Yiguandao years ago. He has begged the Chairman to protect him and has let slip a few thinly-veiled threats to denounce his rival Chu Minyi as another Yiguandao member, worsening the scandal. He says that Dai Chunfeng's agents have already made several enticing offers to shield him and give him a job doing \"research\" for them. But he knows that Wang will do right by him and bury the investigation, publicly exonerating him before the party. In exchange, he is willing to duck away from the spotlight for the near future."

And after what happened to him, Wang and his allies have been plotting their revenge for some time - waiting just long enough for the scandal to fade from public view before counterattacking. And strike back they did.\n\nThe RCA held little back when they began following up on leads regarding financial propriety surrounding the Central Bank of China. Run by Song Ziwen and his clique, investigators claim to have found significant discrepancies in its accounting following a preliminary audit, and have already begun a series of arrests. As they continue to chase down the paper trail, Song has defended his compatriots' actions in a closed-door CEC hearing as being necessary to pay off various illicit debts accrued by the party during the insurgency - a revolutionary necessity. Moreover, he notes that continuing this investigation will undermine the fragile stability of the central bank.\n\nNo one has yet to accuse Song himself, a CEC member and Song Qingling's brother, of any wrong-doing. But as the hounds close in, it is increasingly obvious this witch-hunt is a reprisal for the Yiguandao crisis. Pointedly, Chu Minyi is said to have already been lined up to replace Song, a testament to the Residence Faction's growing power. Faced with the prospect of being publicly disgraced, Song has expressed the preference to quietly resign from his CEC seat (while retaining his responsibilities in the financial world) as his sister's allies scramble to respond."

CHI.midgame.020.d: "While many in the leftist-dominated Kuomintang are grateful for the Internationale's aid and support throughout the air, some have not forgotten that the KMT is indeed the Chinese Nationalist Party. Many in the Party witnessed the events of the 1900 Boxer Rebellion unfold and have grown up in a China long battered by the Western powers.\n\nThe French journalist and member of the Internationale's Military Mission in China, André Malraux, has recently returned from China on leave to report to the European socialist community on the whereabouts of the Chinese national revolution. While he writes warmly of members of the Reorganisation Comrades Association, he also writes warily off the intense politicisation of the National Revolutionary Army - a concept unfamiliar to the French system of militias and the national guard. Furthermore, he presents Deng Yanda in an unflattering and orientalist light - denouncing the latter as a Bonapartist.\n\nIn return, Deng has fired back against such accusations by arguing that the MMIC has intervened in the existing structure of the NRA by promoting individuals such as Zhou Enlai, amongst other conflicts. He rumbles that the MMIC behave recklessly, willing to expend Chinese soldiers like their own version of sepoys or askari.\n\nThe tirade has invited a difficult look into the NRA's politicisation as more nationalist members of the NRA have sided with Deng. In contrast, European-trained officers have sided with Malraux and the decisions made by the MMIC. Faced with this potential faux de pas, the leadership of the Kuomintang must act quickly in deciding whether or not to reprimand the haughty Napoleon-in-the-making or to reprimand the foreign sower of discord."

#Increasing Radicalism Events
CHI.midgame.021.t: "Out of the Shadows"
CHI.midgame.021.d: "When it comes to the business of revolution, it is only natural that a radical energy emerge - particularly among the youthful and the disaffected groups of the old order. That said, the Kuomintang - despite their revolutionary heritage - is often keen on preserving an orderly, authoritative atmosphere, fitting of a vanguardist party. They have also been known for their pragmatism, willing to accommodate aligned groups as needed to advance their goals.\n\nStretching this however, is the entry of newer groups into the national intellectual dialogue. The China Revival Society and the Chinese Syndicalist Party's \"Radical\" faction have both ridden the coattails of the successes of more mainstream socialist groups. However, as nationalistic, iconoclastic sentiment rises they have found a greater following, emboldening them to create newspapers and publications of their own.\n\nAffiliated with the CRS is the Qian Tu (lit. \"Future\", \"Prospects\") paper. Meanwhile many CSP Radicals have begun subscribing to Qu Qiubai's Hot Blood Daily (so-named for their belief that the hot blood of the oppressed will overcome the cold iron of the strong) and Dongfang zazhi (Eastern Miscellany) which frequently runs articles dealing with the tensions between Marxism and utopian socialism.\n\nThe party wields a fairly powerful security apparatus, capable of censoring unwanted opinions as needed - especially those bucking the Kuomintang orthodoxy. That said, driving these groups underground can only slow them down if the underlying source of radicalism is not addressed."

CHI.midgame.022.t: "The Polarisation of the NRA"
CHI.midgame.022.d: "The National Revolutionary Army was created to be the military army of the Kuomintang, directly loyal to the party and the revolution and thereby freeing the Kuomintang from being beholden to regional warlords. Under the leadership of Minister of War Li Jishen, the NRA's high command has worked towards relative political neutrality, refraining from interference in civilian affairs or taking the sides the party political debates the best they can.\n\nThis status quo, however, has come increasingly under strain. Li Jishen has privately reported to Chairman Wang that more and more officers are joining radical groups within the military. Worryingly, the main benefactor is not the \"usual suspects\" - in Deng Yanda and his Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association (WMARCA). Although Deng is too proud to admit it in public, he has privately confessed to his close allies his fears that the WMARCA is losing respect with younger officers and freshly graduated cadets.\n\nThe primary benefactor of this shift appears to be China Revival Society, a group of totalitarian nationalists led by General Hu Zongnan and other disaffected officers. Also distrusting the military Old Guard are many radicals in the CSP, who have begun to organise militias independently of the NRA - increasingly disobeying the directives of the CSP's Orthodox Faction and Internationale advisors. Their decision to organise wildcat strikes and CRS-led attempts to break them up have worsened the atmosphere in major Kuomintang strongholds."

While the media was taking pictures following a speech by Wang outside of the Presidential Palace, a gunman shouting \"down with traitors\" opened fire and just barely missed killing Wang.\n\nThe assassin was apprehended, and Wang (who ironically began his revolutionary career as a failed assassin) was hurried to a hospital to treat minor wounds to his cheek and arm. The greater damage however was the media fallout as images of the attempt circulated. Although most published statements condemning the attack and wishing the Chairman a speedy recovery, plenty noted that this is only the latest report of violence against politicians.\n\nFor insiders, the culprit is an open-secret, even as the police interrogate the perpetrator. Radical officers within the NRA affiliated with the CRS have often acted with reckless abandon, a testament to the Kuomintang's inability to handle the rising radicalism within their own movement, too busy fighting amongst themselves to give stable leadership. Worryingly, many individuals outside of and even opposed to the CRS have responded with indifference or even approval for the act.\n\nThis attack however, is one step too far.

Working through vows of silence, internal stonewalling, and even violence against investigators, an exhaustive conducted by numerous agencies identified the assailant as a member of a broader conspiracy. The small cell he was part of was well organised, and despite efforts to conceal it, part of larger cells nested within cells.\n\nThe trail went cold before any conclusive proof could be brought against anyone, though it was most definitely tied to security and intelligence circles. A disturbing \"hit-list\" was uncovered in a raid, with dozens of names of major civilian and military leaders listed as targets. The extent to which the list represents carefully chosen targets versus fantasy is moot, given its horrific nature.\n\nDue to the clandestine nature of the situation, it is unlikely that the highest ranking culprits will be caught, at least this time. However, making some major arrests will at least prevent the appearance of CRS impunity and send an immediate message to other military cliques who would try something similar. However, the scandal would be great and instead of rocking the boat some have proposed to instead to publicly blame the attempt on reactionaries and imperialists."

Overwhelmed by radical sentiment, fanatical CRS-aligned detachments and CSP-Radical aligned militias parade and brawl in the streets threatening people high and low deemed reactionary. The NRA high command struggles to reign them in, even as their actions grow more and more blatant.\n\nIt is far worse in the countryside, away from the capital. In rural villages and hamlets, once strongholds for the PAC and agrarian cooperative ideals, fear permeates the air. Many turn away from Song and the PAC, seeking protection from the utter mayhem plaguing the region.\n\nAcross the land, radicalised peasants turn to the RCA and CSP radicals, organising militias that often rove about to stamp out \"reactionaries\". Others live in fear of an unnamed \"Laoban\", whose reach appears to grow by the day while CRS paramilitaries leave their NRA garrisons to stamp out communes they deem too autonomous. In response, worrying reports have emerged that some landlords have been allowed to return as the people tire of political radicalism.\n\nIn light of these developments the PAC has doubled down on their strongholds, stripping away various aligned NRA detachments to guard aligned villages, adding to the disarray.

#LCS Mechanic Events
CHI.midgame.026.t: "The World Society Triumphant"
CHI.midgame.026.d: "In 1906, two years after the foundation of the Tongmenghui and long before there was a Syndicalist revolution, the (New) World Society (Shijie she) was founded by four friends Zhang Renjie, Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, and Cai Yuanpei in Paris. They believed that a new world was coming, one of liberation and freedom for every man - one not only political but also social. Young, intellectual, and anarchist at the time, they mentored many future socialists in the Kuomintang through their various revolutionary efforts including newspapers, the Diligent Work-Frugal Study Movement, and countless writings.\n\nUnfortunately, despite being validated by the European revolutions, the syndicalist movement had left them behind in forming the Chinese Syndicalist party. Forced into a secondary role in the League of Chinese Syndicalists, much to their chagrin, their vocal defence of the political tutelage made them unpopular among libertarian socialist circles - Li Shizeng for example has been quoted as saying \"China's fourth-order revolution is a revolution for the entire populace adapted to the complex demands of the situation.\"\n\nStill, their powerful connections within the dominant Kuomintang party (they effectively control the Central Supervisory board) has given them a critical advantage in syndicalist politics and vaunted them once more into the spotlight. Although the League of Chinese Syndicalists has since collapsed under the weight of infighting, the World Society (led by their protege Yi Peiji) commands the respect of most syndicalists in China.\n\nProponents of a certain utopian interpretation of Proudhonist class reconciliation and universal harmony, they condemn what they see as needless stoking of class conflict while creating a syndicalist nation. They have begun to stand harshly against Wang Jingwei and the RCA's authoritarian leadership, throwing their lot with the opposition."

This will no longer be the case, or at least so Chen Shaoyu and other radicals such as Qin Bangxian and Qu Qibai insist. Consisting of many younger syndicalist activists and intellectuals, they chafed under the compromising leadership of the CSP-Orthodox Faction. Far more cynical than the Orthodox Faction, to them, the chaos in China is not merely a product of imperialism or warlordism but capitalism itself. Imperialism, business, landlords, the gentry, and capitalism must be destroyed thoroughly and immediately - and there is little room for compromise, even within the now defunct League of Chinese Syndicalists.\n\nThis radicalism has resulted in many gravitating towards the RCA, particularly Chen Gongbo's wing, seeing them as natural allies in implementing syndicalism in both the cities and the countryside. In practice however, with the Kuomintang jealously guarding their control over aligned unions and the Internationale Military Mission supporting the Political Department over them (seeing them as a more fruitful investment), they struggle for relevance. That has not, however, sapped them of any zeal. Nor has it made them many friends among the moderates within the Kuomintang."

CHI.midgame.028.t: "The CSP-Orthodox Reassert Dominance"
CHI.midgame.028.d: "The first generation of the Chinese Syndicalist party's leadership has long coalesced into the so-called \"Orthodox Faction\", a group of older intellectuals educated abroad. Consisting of many former anarchists and labour organisers, similar to France a compromise was hammered out between the council-based Marxists (led by former anarchist turned councilist Chen Duxiu, who has since renounced the anarchist movement) and union-based syndicalists (led by Li Lisan). They were pragmatic - compromising with the Kuomintang to form the United Front and other non-KMT leftists to form the Chinese Syndicalist party.\n\nThese critical compromise kept the spirit of syndicalism alive and well, even with the disastrous Northern Expedition and many of their revolutionary niches absorbed by the Kuomintang. Primarily urban-based, they reason that the proletariat and peasant must work together to defeat imperialism and further believe that China must industrialise first to achieve true syndicalism. In the meanwhile, they hope to steer their sister party away from authoritarianism.\n\nThe restive nature of the syndicalist movement has unfortunately proved to be its downfall. The League of Chinese Syndicalists is effectively no more, with many having grown alienated by the power-struggles that emerged from within it. Even as the CSP-Orthodox Faction re-establishes its leadership, there is no piecing it back together. That said, Chen and Li are determined to carry on its legacy, ensuring the stable, but steady transition to China's syndicalist future."

#RF Mechanic Event
CHI.midgame.029.t: "A Hawaiian Fifth Column?"
CHI.midgame.029.d: "The Kuomintang's centrist, civilian faction has always had a complicated relationship with the left. When the Western Hills Conference was first held in opposition to the reorganisation and the late Dr. Sun's alliance with the Internationale, Sun Fo and his clique was initially open to joining with other right-wingers but ultimately was cowed by the growing influence of Wang Jingwei. Since then, they have mostly acted on the sidelines, serving as a more pliant internal opposition for the RCA that Wang can \"compromise\" with to demonstrate his statesmanship while containing the PAC.\n\nStill, this has not stopped Sun Fo from openly criticising the government or continuing to champion his relatively liberal views influenced by his education in the United States. The PAC have made repeated overtures to the Reconstruction Faction (RF), but with the RF's growing internal clout it appears the old \"iron-neck\" has begun flying a bit too close to the sun and fancying himself as genuinely the primary alternative to Wang's leadership.\n\nIf that was the case, a harsh reality check is soon to come - outside of government halls and party elders the RF finds very little popular support and a growing chorus of opponents who condemn them for \"selling out the revolution to the bourgeoisie\". The only question is whether or not this denouncement will drag down the rest of party leadership with them."
CHI.midgame.029.a: "Let things go for now."
CHI.midgame.029.b: "We're onto them."

CHI.midgame.030.t: "An India Clique Conspiracy?"
CHI.midgame.030.d: "Despite early warning signs that the Reconstruction Faction's growing influence was illusory, Sun Fo and other Kuomintang liberals have continued to dangerously entrench themselves within the state apparatus. Whether because of their own initiative, the RCA's desire for a controlled opposition, or the PAC's effort to build a broad opposition to Wang, the institutional strength of the RF has backfired.\n\nWhile not necessarily reactionary, the RF is clearly to the right and out of step with the broader Kuomintang. To an extent it appears their leadership recognises this, and the \"India Clique\" (nicknamed for their service [HND.GetNameDef]) have grown bolder in courting high ranking officers in the National Revolutionary Army.\n\nGenerals Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue have been identified as the ring-leaders of this effort and are long-time personal friends of the Sun family. The scandal further imperils the position of Minister of War Li Jishen, a fellow former Fourth Army compatriot. With the neutrality of the National Revolutionary Army now in question, Marshal Li's stature has diminished to the benefit of his enemies, allowing Young Guard officers dissatisfied with his leadership to push for changes."
CHI.midgame.030.a: "The Political Department exploits the gap."
CHI.midgame.030.b: "More officers fall into the arms of the CRS."

#General Political Events
CHI.midgame.031.t: "The Legislative Yuan"
CHI.midgame.031.intro: "Although the Kuomintang, in a vanguardist fashion, maintains that the party takes precedence over the state for the duration of the political tutelage, the conquest of Nanjing means that the party is forced to contend with the realities of governance. To set the groundwork for Dr. Sun's vision, a provisional Legislative Yuan has been established. Still subordinate in status to the Kuomintang National Congress and the Central Executive Committee, the exact relationship between this government parliamentary body and party organs is still in flux.\n\nDespite their junior status, this unicameral legislature is not totally powerless, meeting regularly (unlike the party congress) and appealing to the intellectuals. Naturally of course, RCA members hold a thin majority of seats (albeit divided between radical and moderates). Other KMT seats have been given to the PAC and RF, as well as a few old-guard members. Considerably fewer have been given to the United Front, the largest being the CSP joined by a few allied independents (the Dangwai)."
CHI.midgame.032.ending: "Outflanked by the savvy RCA, the PAC's caucus led by Zhang Bojun and Peng Zexiang have scrambled to rally an unofficial opposition bloc to prevent total RCA dominance. To do so would require aligning the CSP and chipping off some RCA-Moderates, but also securing a deal of their own with the RF and Old Guard. After a series of secretive midnight meetings..."
CHI.midgame.031.d.1: "$CHI.midgame.031.intro$\n\nThe Premier of the Legislative Yuan is Chen Gongbo, the de facto leader of the RCA.

CHI.midgame.031.a: "...an accord is struck."
CHI.midgame.031.b: "...an accord remains elusive."

CHI.midgame.032.t: "The Passage of the [GetYear] Organic Law"
CHI.midgame.032.d: "With a finalised constitution far in the distance (envisioned only after unification), a working group has been tasked by the National Congress to draft an organic law to supplement the largely defunct 1912 Provisional Constitution. It is modelled after Sun Yat-sen's writings, where he envisioned a government with five branches, with a weak President above them.\n\nThe first three are the more traditional Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Yuans. They are joined by the Examination Yuan, dedicated to identifying and keeping records of qualified candidates for civil service positions both nationally and provincially and in some ways a modernised Imperial Service Exam. The second is the Control Yuan, which is given the powers of audit, oversight and impeachment.\n\nGiven the circumstances, these two smaller Yuans are effectively sinecures, meant to respectfully shunt side-lined elders, incompetent recipients of patronage, and over-ambitious upstarts to a place they can do minimal damage. Accordingly there were concerns of corruption and \"bureaucratisation\", however Wang has elected to throw a bone to the Reconstruction Faction. Whether out of genuine idealism or simply to be contrarian, the RF is insistent that the new government be done \"correctly\" in their eyes and follow Sun's constitutional theory.\n\nWith the legislation now sure to be approved, the only remaining matter is how to distribute positions. With a list of applicants already in front of him, the President and his closest advisors decide their nominations..."
CHI.midgame.032.a: "...carefully balanced across factions."
CHI.midgame.032.b: "...based off loyalty to the Chairman."
CHI.midgame.032.c: "...on the merits of each applicant."

CHI.midgame.033.t: "The Judicial Yuan"
CHI.midgame.033.d: "The Judicial Yuan is the branch of government that oversees the Supreme Court, the Supreme Administrative Court, the Disciplinary Court, and also the Ministry of Justice and Administration. Given the numerous constitutional ambiguities during the political tutelage period, with a decades old Provisional Constitution that has yet to be formally replaced, there is some interest by the Kuomintang's competing factions to have a sympathetic figure at its helm. Although in practice the Central Executive Committee has the final say in constitutional affairs, the final candidate will likely set the tone for the yuan as a whole in its formative years.\n\nGiven the RCA's dominance of the government thus far, it is widely expected that Wang will appoint someone from outside of his clique. The leading two candidates are Guo Guanjie and Wu Chaoshu (CC Wu). Guo Guanjie is a French-educated professor of law who taught at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou. Well qualified, he is also a high ranking member of the PAC - a faction Wang would like to keep contained. Wu Chaoshu was the first Chinese lawyer in Hong Kong, educated in the United Kingdom, and the chairman of the Judicial Committee in the 1925 Guangzhou government. His outspoken affiliation with the RF has made him an object of mistrust however among socialist circles.\n\nOf course, there is always a third option. Both men are long-time Kuomintang members, but perhaps some fresh blood is needed. The young Gu Zhengding is a scion of the RCA educated in Sun Yat-sen University in Paris. It certainly would not be a good look for the Chairman, but he's survived worse."
CHI.midgame.033.a: "Guo Guanjie is an experienced legal expert."
CHI.midgame.033.b: "Wu Chaoshu as a compromise candidate."
CHI.midgame.033.c: "Gu Zhengding will shake things up a bit."

CHI.midgame.034.t: "The Clash for Canton"
CHI.midgame.034.d: "Guangzhou, and indeed Guangdong province as a whole, was in many ways the birthplace of the Kuomintang revolution. Many revolutionaries are Cantonese or have deep ties to the region, and as a result it was no surprise that its liberation caused great celebration within the party. President Wang Jingwei gave a triumphant address to great fanfare before a crowd at the old Whampoa site, echoing Dr. Sun's address at the academy's opening ceremony in 1924.\n\nBut as the jubilant mood recedes, the troubles begin. Officially, governors (a title now renamed Chairman of the Provincial Government) are supposed to be elected by local party Provincial Congresses. Practically however, with local cells still in disarray, governance has been administered on an ad hoc basis. With the sheer symbolic importance of Guangdong, the new Provincial Chairman will likely be decided by the Central Executive Committee.\n\nThe Residence Faction has put its weight behind Chen Yaozu, a Guangzhou/Guangdong civil servant in the 1920s and Chen Bijun's younger brother. They managed to strong-arm the reluctant RCA to back his candidacy, but Wang, embarrassed by their shameless nepotism, has expressed some openness in hearing other candidates. Sun Fo and the Reconstruction Faction are backing Liang Hancao, a legislator with experience as a Guangzhou party secretary. Both factions have the same idea in mind - have their associate take control of the region's fruitful patronage networks to build a fortress for their camp.\n\nSong Qingling and Deng Yanda for their part have an ace up their sleeve. General Chen Mingshu, the face of the \"Productive People's Party\" (a KMT splinter group in Guangzhou during Chen Jiongming's rule) continues to be a bastion in regional politics. Despite his checkered past siding with opponents of the party, he has attempted to return to the fold along with the PPP. The MinGan leadership testify that they played an integral part in supplying the insurgency with smuggled arms, and should be rewarded. Others protest that allowing military officer to hold the position would dilute the civilian leadership of our revolution."
CHI.midgame.034.a: "Liang Hancao, the Prince's right-hand man."
CHI.midgame.034.b: "Chen Yaozu, the Chairman's brother-in-law."
CHI.midgame.034.c: "Chen Mingshu, the Provincial General."

CHI.midgame.035.t: "The Fate of the League Officers"
CHI.midgame.035.d: "The national revolution is in full swing, and with it a revolutionary mood. Harnessing the power of the mass movement is ever vital if we are to win this time around, and figuring out how to do so remains fresh on the minds of leading voices in our government. Dong Biwu, perhaps the most famous dual KMT-CSP membership holder, regularly speaks on regulations for punishing local despots. Ling Ping, another radical, speaks of giving farmers their own guards and the power to suppress \"counter-revolutionaries\" on their own initiative. These radical CSP aligned voices are often supported by members of the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine (MMIC), notably M.N. Roy, who argue for radical agrarian uprisings to advance the revolutionary cause. In general, radicals in the CSP (and even some of the Orthodox Faction) see their duty to bring the idea of class struggle from the proletariat in the cities to the rural countryside.\n\nNot everyone agrees however. On the other end of the revolutionary spectrum, there are plenty of those who emphasise the nationalist element of the revolution at the expense of the socialist dimension. They often find their voice in the Reconstruction Faction, who argue that this is not a time to make enemies and that there are plenty of \"honourable\" league authorities who were simply misguided in their initial alignment. They wish to offer broad amnesty for \"reformed\" reactionaries and for the party to moderate its language to simply \"measured\" reforms."
CHI.midgame.035.a: "We sweep away the old order!"
CHI.midgame.035.b: "We unite under one national banner!"

CHI.midgame.036.t: "Reconciling the Gu Brothers"
CHI.midgame.036.d: "The Gu brothers are a political family of Kuomintang loyalists from Guizhou. The young two brothers, Gu Zhenglun and Gu Zhenggang studied abroad in their youth at Sun Yat-sen University in Paris before joining the RCA in its exile phase. They became prominent organisers within the Reorganised Comrades Association (RCA) - often doing the dirty work for Chen Gongbo and are in many ways rising stars for the Radical Faction.\n\nThe elder brother (born over a decade prior to Gu Zhenggang), went a different path. Gu Zhenglun entered military school about four years after the birth of his first younger brother, studying in Japan and participating in the Xinhai Revolution. He fought under Sun Yat-sen in the Constitutional Protection War, and a leading member of the right-wing faction of the Kuomintang. He has become locally famous for organising the Gendarmerie (Military Police) in Yunnan, with giving them the motto \"don't lie, don't cheat, keep your duty, and remember your duty\".\n\nWith the conquest of Guizhou, the younger Gus have lobbied extensively for not only amnesty but also the instatement of their brother to command. Privately, they have noted that the RCA is short on loyalist military personnel, and having a \"Praetorian Guard\" of sorts made up of Gu Zhenglun's fanatically courageous Gendarmerie might give them an edge in forestalling any coup. Naturally of course, there are many who feel allowing not only a reactionary but a party traitor into our ranks puts the entire revolution in jeopardy."
CHI.midgame.036.a: "The bonds of family cannot be erased."
CHI.midgame.036.b: "Loyalty to the nation comes first."

CHI.midgame.037.t: "Dominance of the Reorganised Comrades"
CHI.midgame.037.d: "Strong leadership can unite and strengthen a cause, but when too much power is concentrated around a single leader and his clique, there are often severe ramifications. Wang and his allies have been steadily accruing power across the government, taking advantage of his position as Chairman of the ever weakening CEC and President of the Republic.\n\nThis near absolute power over his rivals, however, has also stifled internal discourse and made it difficult to present even legitimate grievances against his policies. The RCA and the Residence Faction have grown bolder to the point of arrogance, and perhaps even worse than the complacency is that they've already begun fighting over the spoils across major institutions.\n\nWang's rivals are hardly extinguished however. Dissatisfied and no longer feeling that they can achieve change through legitimate channels, many feel enticed towards other means of ousting Wang. If the Chairman wishes to step up and be the wise statesman he claims to be, this would be the time - the stability of the republic is at stake."
CHI.midgame.037.a: "Let's ratchet down the tensions a bit."
CHI.midgame.037.b: "Let's press our advantage while we can!"

CHI.midgame.038.t: "Dominance of the Action Committee"
CHI.midgame.038.d: "Bringing Wang Jingwei and his sycophantic enablers down is a worth cause in preventing tyranny within the revolutionary government, but perhaps things have gone a bit too far as of late. Even as a battle of wills is waged between supporters of the Chairman and his growing list of opponents, the brave soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army and the millions others counting continue to suffer and die across the nation. The Provisional Action Committee does not seek to destroy the Kuomintang along with its conceited RCA leadership, instead they wish to redeem it from within and restore the legitimate values of the party.\n\nNonetheless the withering attacks against Chairman Wang have been ceaseless, destabilising the government as a whole and threatening the cause. It has also bred considerable resentment among those who defend the Chairman as well as those who extol the need for a strong leader to protect the nation. Many radicals are turning away from political pluralism, denouncing it as fostering subversion, and some have turned to violence to enforce what they see as \"order\". "

CHI.midgame.038.b: "Let's double down on our efforts!"

#LCS Mechanic Event
CHI.midgame.039.t: "When the Centre Cannot Hold..."
CHI.midgame.039.d: "As the ranks of syndicalists grows, the League of Chinese Syndicalists has become more and more divided. The original League was founded by the Chinese Syndicalist party as a means of consolidating non-Kuomintang socialists together within the confines of the United Front, as part of a deliberate strategy to maintain leverage in negotiations with their senior partner. This mean that a disparate coalition of Marxists, anarchists, syndicalists, and other leftists - who otherwise would never had any chance of power in the original United Front - were brought under a shaky banner. Now the League suffers from their own success - with all their hard work and sacrifices potentially undone if the League fails to find a direction soon.\n\nLike the Kuomintang, their libertarian promises of utopia have been largely confined to rhetoric for the duration of the tutelage. The Orthodox establishment of the Chinese Syndicalist party is effectively built on being compatible with the United Front, willing to work closely albeit independently with the Kuomintang. They envision a future compromise system of both union-based and council-based democracy, a platform that has come under increasing scrutiny as the flaws of the French system become more apparent. The younger generation of the CSP, often known as the radicals, are Marxist by orientation. Less concerned than their Orthodox peers about democracy in the near-term, they see unions as a means to an end - a way of empowering the proletariat and to be eventually discarded in favour of a council-based system of representation.\n\nOutside of the CSP is the World Society, the continuation of the older Chinese anarchist movement. Utopian by nature, their members are heavily integrated into the Kuomintang and see a future where the League is folded into their senior party. To them, the tutelage is only temporary, and afterwards the Kuomintang (under World Society influence) will march on to a harmonious, free future."
CHI.midgame.039.a: "Embrace the Radicals' independent spirit!"
CHI.midgame.039.b: "Maintain the Orthodox's steady compromise."
CHI.midgame.039.c: "Cultivate the idealism of the World Society."

CHI.midgame.040.t: "The Younger Sister Grows Up!"
CHI.midgame.040.d: "The growing influence of the League of Chinese Syndicalists has not been unnoticed by the Kuomintang. Although in theory joined together in a united front against imperialism and reactionaries, in practice they often compete for influence among similar power bases in students, unions, and intellectuals. Therefore the League's power expands, so does the ranks of its detractors who fear the Kuomintang's role being usurped.\n\nAs evidence of the senior party's displeasure, official newspapers have stopped reporting League successes - downplaying its role in United Front activities and in some cases even portraying them negatively. Discussions have notably chilled between the competing leaderships, especially as younger activists begin to take initiative of their own to break out of the Kuomintang's shadow.\n\nFaced with this situation, the leaders of the League have begun to diverge in approach. Independence has its benefits in establishing the syndicalist movement as being more than just window-dressing, but it has its cost - especially as power begins to shift. On the other hand, remaining too close to the Kuomintang has drawn criticism of being overly subordinate - discarding syndicalists promises for the benefit of entrenched party interests over the needs of the people."

###Section 2b (200-399): Military Content

CHI.midgame.200.t: "Factions within the Academy"
CHI.midgame.200.d: "When the National Revolutionary Army collapsed during the concluding stages of the Northern Expedition, it also had to bear the loss of the academy's beloved instructor - the now controversial Chiang Kai-shek. As the NRA remnants loyal to the left-wing of the Party fled for the MinGan Zone, they nominated the capable general Li Jishen to take on the role of Whampoa's headmaster.\n\nAs the titular headmaster and War Minister of the Kuomintang, Li transformed and prepared the NRA for its liberation of China's east. However his responsibilities has since grown tremendously and he has indicated his desire to delegate responsibility for the restored academy to someone else. Meanwhile with the NRA swelling in ranks, staff officers who served with distinction during the League War have been promoted to fill newly opened positions, most notably Huang Qixiang, Zhang Fakui, and Xiao Jinguang.\n\nDespite the plethora of new openings, competition has nonetheless been fierce, especially within the growing Academy in regard to Li's successor. Members of the NRA's Old Guard, including long-time guerrilla officers, have coalesced around the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association (WMARCA). Their leader is Deng Yanda, Whampoa's former head of the Political Department and co-leader of the PAC.\n\nThey are opposed by the \"Young Guard\" of the army, consisting primarily of those trained abroad in the Whampoa in exile. These European-trained officers favour a modern approach to the NRA, seeking to transform it into a truly party-subordinate armed force while relying on Western-style tactics and technologies. Led by the deputy (and often acting) Headmaster of Whampoa during the exile period, Zhang Zhizhong (an RCA sympathiser), their supporters have traded accusations with the Old Guard for their \"outdated\" views and tolerance of suspected reactionaries. In turn, WMARCA officers often suspect the young guard of harbouring ultra-radicals within their ranks, with potentially nefarious ideas for the future."
CHI.midgame.200.a: "A new headmaster is needed soon..."

#Military Tree Events
CHI.midgame.201.t: "The Old Guard Prevails!"
CHI.midgame.201.d: "After much debate within the upper echelons of the National Revolutionary Army, the NRA elected to follow the leadership of Whampoa's new headmaster Deng Yanda and his Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association. The NRA's official military doctrine, therefore, is to focus on rapid engagements designed to strike and surprise the enemy - focusing on grand encirclements against what could potentially be a much larger enemy foe. For many of the officers that had served in the guerrilla zone, such as Zhang Yunyi, Wang Yaowu, and Xu Xiangqian, promotions have been handed out due to their service.\n\nSince the return of the Kuomintang to the world of Chinese politics, Deng Yanda's WMARCA has grown substantially in size - owing itself primarily to alumni members of the Whampoa Academy and also to those who are personally loyal to Deng. Organised into smaller cells, the goal of the WMARCA is to inspire and recruit new and past members of Whampoa; so that they may foster loyalty to the Provisional Action Committee.\n\nWhen the NRA split, a faction loyal to the leftist Central Committee was sent to wait and observe the nationalist revolution held in [HND.GetNameDef]. The so-called India Clique is known throughout the Central Committee as being sympathetic to the Nationalist Revolution while not necessarily holding much commitment to the ideals of socialism. While Deng was overseas, he was able to establish connections with sympathetic Indian ears, and curiously enough, the NRA officers stationed in India offered their membership in the WMARCA. Citing Deng's connections to the former 4th Army of the NRA and their respect for the General, working with these officers may help give the PAC further support within the NRA."
CHI.midgame.201.a: "Invite the India Clique in."
CHI.midgame.201.b: "We can't trust them to lead the revolution."

CHI.midgame.202.t: "The Red Napoleon"
CHI.midgame.202.d: "Eloquent, charismatic, handsome, visionary - these are words that the pamphlets of the PAC and the WMARCA frequently use to describe the headmaster of Whampoa, Deng Yanda. To some observers, owing to his military genius and his studies in Europe- he has earned the nickname of \"the Tukhachevsky of the East\" or even \"Red Napoleon\" due to the considerable influence he had gained within the Kuomintang and the National Revolutionary Army. The General holds connections ranging from Guangdong militarists such as Chen Jiongming, Chen Mingshu, and Deng Keng to those within both the LCS and the conservative wings of the Kuomintang. Not only is he a soldier, but years of study and party politics have gifted Deng with a great sense of politics, and he is known to be well-versed in Marxism. A highly proud man, Deng views himself as a tool in the greater spinning wheel of destiny - with the PAC's revolution an inevitable part of world history.\n\nWhile few can deny that within China, there are few as exceptional as General Deng Yanda - there are also those who view his arrogance with heavy distaste. In speeches given to the WMARCA, he has likened the PAC to the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ - with himself being the Christ, willing to be sacrificed on the cross for national salvation. His frequent engagement in criticism of Wang Jingwei has earned the scathing hatred of RCA members such as Chen Gongbo and the Residence Faction. There are rumours among more radical NRA members that Deng is merely a romantic fool that may drive China into chaos.\n\nNonetheless, Deng is held in high regard by the WMARCA and many of the so-called \"Old Guard\" of the NRA. While having our own Red Napoleon certainly boosts morale, perhaps we should consider toning down the rhetoric of such praise - lest we further divide the Party's unity."
CHI.midgame.202.a: "There is no one else like our General!"
CHI.midgame.202.b: "Maybe we can tone it down a bit."

CHI.midgame.203.t: "Triumph of the Young Guard"
CHI.midgame.203.d: "After much debate within the upper echelons of the National Revolutionary Army, the NRA elected to follow the leadership of Zhang Zhizhong as the new headmaster of the Whampoa Military Academy. As such the NRA would pursue Zhang and the Young Guard's proposal for the NRA to be extensively modelled on the armies of the West - with an emphasis on speed, force contraction, and a highly centralised military command structure. Several leading officers from Europe have been promoted as well including Nie Rongzhen and Du Yuming (the latter of whom is actually a member of Deng Yanda's WMARCA but nonetheless has pledged to work with the new headmaster due to his own interest in armoured technology). Recent appointments have also curiously seen a number of \"China Revival Society\"(CRS) members promoted including He Zhonghan and Deng Wenyi. While appearing as army reformers and modernists, there are rumours that they hold much more radical plans on the direction of the NRA.\n\nIn addition, there has also been a curious interest to the growing relevance of the China Revival Society and the \"European returnees.\" For some in the MinGan Zone, the leadership for the past decade was decentralised to say the least, and some MinGan members preferred the nostalgia of a different era, when the Academy was led by an endearing headmaster whose absolute word was authority. As a result some of those who were in the NRA during the insurgency have nonetheless began to pivot ideologically towards the growing influence of the so-called \"Young Guard.\"\n\nCertainly the Young Guard brings a new energy to Whampoa, with the new headmaster proclaiming that this will be the start of a new modern Chinese revolutionary army. Nonetheless there has been notice that there are more radical ideas being published or spread routinely - ideas linking the revolution to Maximalism, Savinkov, and Sorel. Only time will tell whether or not this threat of radicalism is real."
CHI.midgame.203.a: "We need fresh ideas to win."
CHI.midgame.203.b: "Their ideas are awfully drastic."

CHI.midgame.204.t: "The United Front and Whampoa"
CHI.midgame.204.d: "Despite the Kuomintang's United Front policy with the League of Chinese Syndicalists  (LCS), the party's \"Dang Guo\" policy had in theory only allocated those with Kuomintang membership to participate in the training halls of Whampoa. Nonetheless, in the spirit of the Academy's first united front policies, those who are members of the Chinese Syndicalist Party are allowed to enrol in Whampoa despite holding membership for both the CSP and the KMT.\n\nThe Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine (MMIC) has nonetheless proposed that the Kuomintang relax its strict policy on cultivating party members to Whampoa. They argue that if the Kuomintang is to indeed become the vanguard for a free China - that it must be open to the idea of accepting other patriotic Chinese revolutionaries to the academy's ranks. Furthermore, they would like to be able to sponsor individuals from the LCS to participate in Whampoa under their proposed reformed policy.\n\nWhile the move has been met with warm reception by Guo Moruo (an LCS member in the Kuomintang's political department) along with more radical members of the LCS, who do not have joint membership but rather are mostly loyal to the Chinese Syndicalist Party - the proposal has also been met with frustration especially amongst more conservative members of the Party. To them, the introduction of recruits from non-KMT aligned socialist leagues or unions will merely dilute the ideals of both the Party and the Army. As such a compromise has been proposed - to only allow a certain number of syndicalists from the CSP to participate in the new ranks."
CHI.midgame.204.a: "Allow anyone from the National Revolution to join."
CHI.midgame.204.b: "Allow only token CSP representation."
CHI.midgame.204.c: "Maintain a strict one party stance."

CHI.midgame.205.t: "The Propaganda Department"
CHI.midgame.205.d: "In May of 1924, the first cadets at Whampoa received political training from Whampoa's newly established Political Department - inspired by revolutionary trends worldwide. At that time, Liao Zhongkai was appointed the official head of the department. At the same time, prominent party members such as Dai Jitao, Wang Jingwei, and Hu Hanmin were lecturers in political subjects. This first class was routinely given political talks as they were organised into the Model Regiment - the precursor to the NRA's First Army.\n\nWith the re-establishment of Whampoa, the Political Department has been re-established with General Zhou Enlai once more resuming his position as head of the political department. With the encouragement of some in the RCA and LCS, Zhou has the position to encourage Whampoa students to read about socialism, the history of the French and British revolutions, and Marxism. Nonetheless, other ideas are flourishing in lectures as well - General Deng Yanda is known to frequently encourage his soldiers to seek the peasants out in the countryside and to live amongst them. Other classes play up the notion of carrying the late Dr. Sun's will with the promise that perhaps the Kuomintang may be successful this time. There have also been lectures by more nationalistic and radical officers, who instead focus on revitalising the revolution against China's true domestic and foreign enemies."

CHI.midgame.206.t: "The Fujian Naval Community"
CHI.midgame.206.d: "Fujian is home to a thriving naval community, owing to its strategic location and lucrative coastal trade over the years. Fuzhou for example is home to major naval institutions such as Fuzhou Shipping Bureau, Fuzhou Shipping Academy, and Mawei Naval Academy. Even with the Legation Cities establishing further control over the area, Fujianese often dominate the military and civilian fleet. Further north, the Jiangnan region also competes as a naval and commercial shipping centre. Jiangnan Shipyard and Wusong Naval Academy in Shanghai and Jiangnan Naval Academy near Nanjing have provided ships and sailors for the modernising nation.\n\nWith the triumph of our previously Fujian-based revolutionaries and the provisional capital being established in Nanjing, it is only natural that both regions dominate our small fleet. That said however, like most things in the new government, things have quickly divided into factions. Li Zhilong, a graduate of Wusong and having studied abroad in the exile period, has rallied a clique of Internationale trained officers and those educated at Whampoa naval academy to demand a strictly socialist, revolutionary navy. They argue that with the limited number of officer spots available, they may as well be filled with dedicated revolutionaries and in any case foreign trained officers are of superior quality.\n\nChen Shaokuan and Chen Jiliang, both Fujianese and graduates of Jiangnan Naval Academy, have pushed for the broader admission of former League personnel like themselves. They dream of a much larger fleet and call for a lenient political rehabilitation programme, merely requiring vetting from known Kuomintang loyalists. Given the fluid nature of loyalties during the insurgent period and tight family ties of the region, this would give a substantial advantage to old MinGan leadership."
CHI.midgame.206.a: "Keep the revolution pure - favour the Whampoa naval clique."
CHI.midgame.206.b: "A grand navy is our shield - favour the Fujianese naval clique."

CHI.midgame.207.t: "The Central Naval Academy"
CHI.midgame.207.d: "The sea and rivers is the lifeblood for much of the Five Provinces, and for our revolution we depend on access to Internationale aid shipments and regular donations from OCC comprador bourgeoisie magnates. For much of the late Qing era, the navy was heavily decentralised and placed under regional leadership, with little coordination. This problem was worsened by the diverting of funding away from the fleet during the warlord era, a neglect that further hollowed out our naval capabilities.\n\nYet, slowly but surely this appears to be ready for change. Senior naval officers have proposed setting the groundwork for rebuilding the Chinese fleet to match imperialist powers, a process that may take years but the basic preparations can begin almost immediately. They have taken over the old Jiangnan Naval Academy site, turning it into the headquarters for the Republic of China navy.\n\nTheir zeal and grandiose visions, however, have soon met a match with the senior National Revolutionary Army leadership, who have demanded a total modernisation of the fleet under a central command structure. Rather than the Navy being given an equal seat at the table however, it is clear their vision involves the subordination of this new fleet to the army - a fact reinforced by the NRA's plan to create their own naval school under army jurisdiction. Naval officers have protested that the generals simply do not understand naval affairs and the navy should be a separate branch, widening the headache the Military Affairs Commission is now forced to address."

CHI.midgame.208.t: "Internal Security of the Party"
CHI.midgame.208.d: "While the revolution may have initially been successful with the recent victories of the NRA during the League War, to many within the Party - there are still plenty of imperialists, warlords, dissenters, counter-revolutionaries, and reactionaries that lurk even amongst the Party itself. As such the Central Committee has come together in a brief emergency meeting to determine the future of the Party's internal security apparatus.\n\nEncouraged by the Reorganised Comrades Association, the Political Department under the distinguished General Zhou Enlai has proposed the creation of the \"Special Service Section of the Central Committee\" (Zhongyang Teke). Along with his chief lieutenants Gu Shunzhang, Xiang Zhongfa, and Xiong Xianghui - the Teke professes to enforcing the party's socialist based orthodoxy while promising efficiency to root out local resistance. Nicknamed the \"Red Squad\", the organisation's members are mostly localised in the Legation Cities with connections ranging from syndicalist unions to gangsters.\n\nMeanwhile, members of the National Revolutionary Army have been eager to push utilising Dai Chunfeng's established networks across the Shanghai Underground to create the National Bureau of Investigation and Statistics \"Juntong.\" An outgrowth of underground clandestine activities with extensive connections to criminal activity and \"nationalistic\" gangs, the Juntong is known to have some fraternal and semi-esoteric behaviour - with their own shadowy \"League of Ten\", whom profess nothing but absolute loyalty to their Laoban, Dai Chunfeng.\n\nAs a compromise, party members have instead suggested merging both planned organisations to create a unified Ministry of State Security. Increasingly worried by the growing factionalism within the Kuomintang, this plan will place the leadership of state security under Dai Chunfeng, while granting considerable power to Zhou and the Political Department in handling internal affairs."

CHI.midgame.209.t: "Teke Heroism on Display!"
CHI.midgame.209.d: "Nicknamed the \"Zhongyang Teke\", the Special Operations Section of the Central Committee is the brainchild of the head of the political department - General Zhou Enlai. The organisation is made up of mostly younger volunteers, those with connections to syndicalist-aligned unions, and some Shanghai gangsters. It is split into four departments: The first section (General Service Section) is in charge of protecting members of the Central Committee, the second section (Intelligence Section) is in charge of gathering intelligence on foreign and domestic enemies, the third section (Operations Section also known as the Red Squad) are in charge of assassinations, and the fourth section is the Communications Section in charge of maintaining secret codes and communications.\n\nOne of their most recent exploits involve the freeing of a prominent Chinese syndicalist Ren Bishi. Ren had been betrayed by Bai Xin, a former Whampoa alumni who has grown disillusioned with the cause. At an underground syndicalist rally in Shanghai, Legation Cities stormed the meeting hall with the help of Bai Xin's information and arrested Ren on the spot. As Ren was being escorted in a police truck to the mansion of Fan Zhengbo (detective captain of the Shanghai Police Command), members of the Operations Section ambushed the truck with pistols and submachine guns. In the chaos of the fighting, Bai Xin attempted to flee the scene but was caught and subsequently eliminated in the operation.\n\nThe operation has been lauded as a complete success with minimal losses by the Party and also by the League of Chinese Syndicalists for supporting their fellow socialists. Since the operation happened on the soil of the Legation Cities, it is also seen as a victory against foreign imperialism. Members of the Central Committee have suggested using Teke's power further by arguing that they may be used to either strengthen the Party internally, crackdown on internal dissent, or raise support amongst like-minded socialist groups and organisations."

CHI.midgame.210.d: "With funding for their plans secured, the League of Ten have sprung into action in building their new \"Juntong\" (National Bureau of Investigation and Statistics). Originating from a mixture of Dai Chunfeng's shady connections with the Shanghai nationalist underground and the existing military intelligence apparatus, this new agency is gearing up for offensive action - infiltrating and destabilising rival factions in China. Dai has posed three priorities for his agents to guide them for the years to come.\n\n1.) Ensure the Leader's Safety. Although they are now officially independent of Hu Zongnan's personal staff, it is clear that Dai remains a major asset for the general and his clique of extremist officers.It is no secret that they view Wang as an unworthy leader, and want him replaced.\n\n2.) Punish Corruption. The League was known to have a spartan, fraternal work environment, mixing Confucianism and revolutionary nationalism to become what they say as modern knight-errants (ironically, Dai is self conscious about his lack of direct military experience compared to his Whampoa classmates). The Juntong are adamant about eliminating internal corruption, and xenophobically view both the RF and CSP as foreign lackeys.\n\n3.) Destroy all counter-revolutionary forces. The Juntong are utterly devoted to the nationalistic cause and have thrown themselves into the task at hand. Cells are being established across the nation, and agents embedding themselves across society. Clergymen, politicians, the press have been swayed, bribed, or coerced into service and Dai has already begun making ties with movie stars, playboys, and opera performers. Even plenty of Chinese overseas have been recruited to this growing intelligence agency."

CHI.midgame.211.intro: "Agents of [CHI.GetNameDef] are on the move! Ever since their victory over the League, the Kuomintang and their allies have swelled in numbers, with pockets of sympathisers scattered all over the nation. Some are true believers - educated in socialism's promises and disgruntled with the status quo. Some are veterans of China's various republican armies, who have thrown their lot with a new hope. Many are graduates of Whampoa, whose nationalistic or revolutionary spirit has been reawakened by the party's return. Still, plenty are simply men or women with their own private grudges, or perhaps bought off by the prospect of social mobility."
CHI.midgame.211.d.CHI.juntong: "$CHI.midgame.211.intro$\n\nDai Chunfeng has organised his detachments carefully, selecting leaders often from men he knew from his Whampoa days. Zheng Jiemin has been sent southwards to set up camp in Guangdong, while the Hunan branch has been assigned to Tang Zong. Further west cells have been established in the mountains under Qiu Kaiji in Kunming and Zeng Guangqing in Chengdu. Northwards defunct cells under Qiao Jiacai and Ma Hansan have been reactivated, and contact made with Manchuria-based freedom fighters led by Guan Xiangying. In the various Legation cities, different station chiefs have been appointed, most notably Shanghai station chief Shen Zui. Closest to the centre of power is Dai's childhood friend Mao Renfeng, assigned to the east. Helping coordinate them is Wei Daming, a prominent communications officer.\n\nThese men, and the hundreds beneath them have gone into the belly of the beast, putting their lives in jeopardy for the cause. We can only hope that their sacrifices will be worth it one day."
CHI.midgame.211.d.juntong: "$CHI.midgame.211.intro$\n\nWhatever the case, the source is fairly obvious. [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has authorised the creation of the humbly named National Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (also known as the Juntong) to coordinate existing clandestine networks. Led by the secretive Dai Chunfeng, detachments organised by Dai's must trusted men have been deployed nation-wide to establish sleeper cells in the various provinces. He has taken advantage of his various criminal contacts along the coast, an outgrowth of his old \"League of Ten\", but he is no ordinary gangster - his men are noted for their fanatic nationalism and commitment to the cause. Their practical ability to undermine our government is doubtful, and much of their activities have been dismissed as bluster, but we would be wise to keep an vigilant watch all the same."
CHI.midgame.211.d.CHI.teke: "$CHI.midgame.211.intro$\n\nZhou Enlai has worked diligently in building his agency, a collection of men and women from varying walks of life. Many senior officers are from the \"Red Squad\" and long-time party operatives, though Zhou has been careful to select plenty of agents who did not have a long history as socialists - letting them blend in both inside the party and outside. Four operational sections have been created: the General Affairs Section, the Information Section, the Radio Communication Section, and the Action Section. Given Zhou's responsibilities elsewhere, his chief lieutenants Chen Geng, Gu Shunzhang, and Xiang Zhongfa often handle the day to day running of the Teke."

Led by prominent revolutionary, propagandist, and and intelligence coordinator Zhou Enlai and built around a core of intelligence operatives known as the \"Red Squad\", these agents have been sent to even the farthest corners of the nation. Ruthless as they are zealous, nonetheless they are unlikely to be able to directly undermine our government. However, it is clear the Kuomintang's national ambitions are growing."

CHI.midgame.212.t: "Dysfunction in the MSS"
CHI.midgame.212.d: "Like oil and water, the Red Squad and the League of Ten have not mixed well at all. Ostensibly under the purview of the Ministry of State Security, the competing groups have found themselves nearly constantly at odds despite initial efforts to integrate the revolutionary agencies. Frustrated, an effort was made to try and separate the two into different departments - with the Red Squad being assigned to interior tasks and the League assigned to external assignments.\n\nThis has not panned out all that well either. Like squabbling children, there have been fights over control of many lucrative functions such as the collection of taxes and tariffs, maintaining of smuggling networks, secret policing, and foreign intelligence gathering. A superficial level audit has revealed multiple parallel organisations, and considerable resources have been spent spying on one another rather than doing their jobs. The last straw for many in the CEC however was the decision for Dai Chunfeng and Zhou Enlai's partisans to go to the press to air their grievances, accusing the other of stealing credit and undermining the MSS.\n\nHaving made an utter fool of themselves in public and with patience running out, Deng Yanda has finally made his move. He has proposed sacking Dai as acting head of the ministry and curtailing Zhou's influence, instead creating a new position of Minister of the Interior. He has pushed forward Zhang Yunchuan, a WMARCA military officer, who has promised to build the MSS from scratch - effectively sidelining both the Red Squad and League of Ten.\n\nSome wonder if this was what the PAC wanted all along - a chance to put a man on the cabinet. Faced with the threat, both MSS factions have sworn up and down that they will back off from infighting, and that any issues were mere growing pains. This is not a particularly credible assertion, but on the other hand, whatever we choose things can really only go up from here anyway."

CHI.midgame.213.d.deng: "If National Revolutionary Army had a face ever since General Chiang's untimely death, it would be Deng Yanda. His storied career has taken him to the halls of Whampoa, to the cities of Europe, the hills of Jiangxi, and now to battlefields across China. With every success, his prominence rises - creating a powerful nucleus for those seeking an alternative to Wang's rule. But as his prestige soars, sometimes even his closest allies fear he is flying too close to the sun, and derogatory comments of a \"Red Napoleon\" have quickly swirled. For now though, public opinion remains on his side and so does the army as he basks in military glory."
CHI.midgame.213.d.zhou: "If there is anyone who can save the National Revolutionary Army from corruption, it is Zhou Enlai. Diplomatic and humble, but well vested in socialist ideology, he is a long-time favourite of the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine as a paragon for a red officer. Although plenty questioned how effectively a political officer, Whampoa instructor, and minor guerilla commander would fare in the field, the trust has paid off with his determined leadership in combat. With his prestige at an all-time high, he is expected to exert it to bring the National Revolutionary Army closer to his camp, helping fend off the disloyal military cabals that threaten national stability."
CHI.midgame.213.d.hu: "Built to create a force totally loyal to the Kuomintang, Whampoa's graduates have fought courageously for the party. But sometimes the National Revolutionary Army can take a life of its own, demanding revolution even within the party. Hu Zongnan is a veteran some of the earliest KMT expeditions, but was deprived of his chance at glory in 1927. He nonetheless made up for lost time with his recent accomplishments in the battlefield. His successes are hard to dispute, but one questions if those victories are truly to the benefit of the party. The zeal and brutality of Hu's men have caused significant concern within the CEC, even as they have little choice but to laud him in public."
CHI.midgame.213.d.zhang: "Zhang Fakui was Dr. Sun's personal bodyguard and fought for the Kuomintang all across the Warlord Era. He rose to become commander of the legendary Fourth (\"Iron\") Army during the Northern Expedition, but during the exile period he was sidelined and sent to India to help advise [HND.GetAdjective] forces. Since the return however, he has eagerly retaken the initiative on the battlefield and claimed multiple success. With each triumph, he elevates the influence of his \"India Clique\" of centre-right officers closely affiliated with the Reconstruction Faction. How much this may calm troubled waters within the military as opposed to aggravating existing rivalries remains to be seen."
CHI.midgame.213.d.xiao: "In many ways, Xiao Jinguang is an unlikely military hero for the Chinese revolution. Born to a disadvantaged family in Hunan, his father and grandfather died suddenly. Yet he rose to prominence nonetheless, joining the newly founded Chinese Syndicalist party and going abroad to study military theory in France. An outsider within the military, neither educated nor teaching at Whampoa, his road to command was very narrow. But having been given the chance, he has scored multiple triumphs in the battlefield. The LCS's leadership has lauded him as an example for a younger generation of syndicalist officers struggling to break into higher ranks dominated by KMT members and Old Whampoa graduates."

But now that he has finally centralised power around himself, Li has started cracking down on leftists within the army and the government, which has led to many fleeing persecution into a more friendly government.\n\nToday, some of them have arrived in [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], swearing their allegiance to the Kuomintang, and offering their help in our revolutionary efforts. Among them are general Ye Jianying from Guangdong, who, despite being a committed member of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, took arms against Chen Jiongming after his betrayal, and helped Sun Yat-sen escape Guangzhou. Alongside him comes general Liu Fei. A former Guangxi officer and member of the Kuomintang, he has nonetheless become a target of rightist persecution, likely due to his suspected syndicalist sympathies. Last is Tan Pingshan. A former member of the Tongmenghui, and leading figure of the Guangdong branch of the CSP, there is no doubt of his desire of seeing revolution in China through. Tan has also expressed sympathy towards Deng Yanda's PAC, and would no doubt be a competent mediating personality working for our coalition, if given the chance.\n\nStill, some dissenting voices are suggesting we turn down their offer.

CHI.midgame.218.t: "The Military Affairs Commission"
CHI.midgame.218.d: "The Military Affairs Commission (MAC) was originally founded in Guangzhou as a means of overseeing, supervising and managing the National Revolutionary Army in its infancy. Originally with 64 members, Dr. Sun reduced it to 26, and by the time he died it was reduced to a board consisting of Wang Jingwei, Xu Chongzhi, Liao Zhongkai, Hu Hanmin, Tan Yankai, Chiang Kai-shek, Mikhail Borodin, and Wu Chaoshu. In the ensuing year or so, Cheng Qian, Li Jishen and Chen Gongbo would join the staff along with allied warlords Li Zongren, Huang Shaohong, Feng Yuxiang, Li Fulin, and Gu Yingfen.\n\nThe infighting among the MAC did it little favours during the Northern Expedition, as Chiang attempted to strong-arm Wang into yielding the Chairmanship to him, charging Wang with incompetence in military affairs. Most of its old membership have since gone one too - Tan and the warlords left, Hu and Xu were executed, Borodin recalled and replaced by Malraux, Chiang was killed in the expedition.\n\nHaving recently been restored to coordinate the new National Revolutionary Army's activities, many fear a repeat of previous battles over control of the MAC. The military brass blame interference from civilians and outsiders for its old failures, demanding only the President and senior commanders be appointed. This has been contested by those believe the NRA must be held accountable, denouncing the independent streak Chiang encouraged, and insist on further civilian oversight by the Central Executive Committee. The United Front with the backing of the MMIC has also insisted on a fair say, complicating matters even more - insisting on LCS and advisor presence on the commission.

As a Korean nationalist party, the KNRP is generally a socialist party that also professes to adapt and follow the Three Principles of the People. As the Korean people, like the Chinese people, are oppressed and live under the chains of Japanese imperialism, the bonds between these two nations are strong. As the conflict between the Empire of Japan and a nationalist-led China seems inevitable, many Korean expatriates believe that by working with the Chinese, they may one day achieve independence with Chinese help.\n\nThat being said, per formal orders to the NRA - Kim Wonbong's rank and status have been reinstated as an official soldier within the NRA. He commands the Korean Liberation Army, a battalion of equally patriotic Korean volunteers, including a young Chang Cheol-bu, with the grand goal that one day they may return home to Korea as liberators."

CHI.midgame.221.t.china: "Mission to [HND.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
CHI.midgame.221.d.india: "Across the continent, anti-colonial sentiment has swept the Chinese nation. Of such groups is the Chinese Kuomintang, a nationalist, vanguardist party built around Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles. Dominated by leftists, they have driven out various warlords that have occupied the east coast and recently have begun outreach towards like-minded governments.\n\nAs one of the largest revolutionary governments working to free their nation from colonial shackles, the Kuomintang claim us to be kindred spirits. In some ways, this outreach began as early as 1907 when exiled Chinese revolutionaries worked with Indians and Japanese revolutionaries to form the \"Asiatic Humanitarian Brotherhood\".\n\nTimes however have changed considerably. The Northern Expedition's failure in 1927 torpedoed their initial chances at uniting their nation, and they have continued to drift leftwards. A small detachment of Chinese advisors were sent to aid us in 1934, though have since returned home, but the Chinese have been quick to point this out as proof that a fruitful partnership is possible.\n\nEven as they have returned, there is no guarantee of their success. And even if they were successful, Japan's power continues to rise, and they are likely to clash with the Chinese one way or another. Moreover, there remains disputes about the Sino-Indian borders and the status of Tibet as the Kuomintang embrace revanchism.\n\nAs the Chinese offer to mutually recognise one another, the dream of Pan-Asian cooperation seems dim. But might we still dream?"
CHI.midgame.221.d.china: "Across the continent, a liberation fever swept across India and the people have risen up against their British oppressors! The result was the foundation of [HND.GetNameDef] by the Indian National Congress and their various allies, a government that stands as a continued testament to freedom's enduring call.\n\nOften working parallel to our own efforts across the 1920s, the [HND.GetAdjectiveCap]s are often seen as kindred spirits to our own. In some ways, this exchange of ideas began as early as 1907 when exiled Chinese revolutionaries worked with Indians and Japanese revolutionaries to form the \"Asiatic Humanitarian Brotherhood\".\n\nAs we work to free our homeland, it is imperative that we remember all the others in Asia that need liberation. A direct example of such pan-Asian partnership, independent of Japan's misguided sphere, was the Chinese military mission sent to India in 1934 under Zhang Fakui. There remain of course plenty of hurdles in future ties, such as the question of borders and dealing with the Japanese threat.

After all, the German intervention in 1927 showed more than anything that our struggles are connected.\n\nThe Viet Minh are a coalition of disparate socialist groups united under one banner, and there have been different points of contact throughout the years. Several attended Whampoa for example, and a few dozen even fought with us in the MinGan insurgency. Others were trained by our officers in India during the exile period. On a civilian level, their chapters are scattered throughout Southeast Asia, similar to our own diaspora networks and there is frequent contact between them.\n\nThe practical element of supporting them is more of a challenge. The [INC.GetAdjective] revolutionaries do have sympathetic contacts among civilian shipping, which has allowed them to partially evade the [GEA.GetAdjective] naval blockade, usually by first sending equipment to Bangkok and then smuggling it overland to rebel held territories. If we pooled our resources with our own OCC contacts in Southeast Asia, we might be able to get a few shipments through, though it will be dangerous and not all will make it.\n\nOwning ports closer to the region would be a great advantage, most notably Guangzhou. Given the extensive trade that flows to and from there, it would be much easier and cheaper to smuggle in equipment and we could send far more of it. Access to [SIA.GetAdjective] territory through the border with Yunnan would also be advantageous - its porous nature combined with [SIA.GetAdjective] disdain for their neighbours has allowed for overland smuggling trails to Indochina from the north as well.\n\nAll in all it is our duty to support our revolutionary comrades, though perhaps this simply isn't the right time."

Replicating the apparent accomplishments in MinGan has been difficult and divisive despite a shared goal of peasant run cooperatives.\n\nChen Gongbo, the leading RCA ideologue, has argued that China is a semi-feudal state that requires political organisation before a social revolution could occur. While class conflict is inevitable, he believes the mass movement requires a different handling than in Europe. Chen Duxiu and the CSP-Orthodox have switched to adopt this stance, however many CSP-Radicals continue to argue that China's problem is not feudal institutions but the domination of urban capitalists, and must adopt a proletarian socialist revolution.\n\nGu Mengyu and many RCA-Moderates contend that class struggle is not inevitable, and that China is an incipient capitalistic nation dominated by feudal lords. They, World Society, and others call for a non-violent land reform focused on rent caps and moderate redistributions. Not included in the discussion are the commoners themselves, who often know little of Marxism, syndicalism or nationalism and cling onto traditions and superstitions - a dissonance not uncommon in vanguardist politics.\n\nAs pilot programmes for land reform begin in Jiangsu, these clashing philosophies take centre stage. Until now, redistribution has been implemented on an ad-hoc basis by various commanders and commissars, creating a patchwork and inefficient system. The PAC have pushed for allowing peasants to organise from the get-go, with the party coordinating them later. The RCA have encouraged having magistrates to organise land first before giving it to the peasants, and condemn what they see as subversive PAC activity. Some extremists have privately urged the need for total nationalisation until the end of tutelage, saying it is a wartime measure."
CHI.midgame.400.a: "Leave the patchwork system as is for now."
CHI.midgame.400.b: "Deploy magistrates to streamline matters."

CHI.midgame.401.t: "Rocking the Boat"
CHI.midgame.401.d: "Across the board, the Chinese left can agree on one thing: that the sheer destitution and crushing poverty of the peasants have left them in a state of de facto feudalism, worsened by the utter instability of the warlord era. Freeing them from the (often absentee) landlords, foreign interests, tyrannical warlords and their local thugs is a major revolutionary goal, and the Kuomintang can chalk plenty of their successes to their ability to rally rural enthusiasm and nearly spontaneous uprisings of peasant militias as they march.\n\nSo why not be truly revolutionary? Not simply defeating old tyrants and replacing them, but building an entirely new system. Sadly however, progress requires breaking a few omelets, and it's not always as easy as chasing out old reactionaries.\n\nWhen magistrates (often affiliated with the RCA) were deployed in areas just outside of Nanjing to to help reorganise freshly created cooperatives and sort out disputes, many reported being intimidated or even fired upon by local militias. Worryingly, many were previously armed by the NRA and report fears that central government magistrates have come to take their land.\n\nIt wasn't long before accusations of treason began to fly. Angry hearings have charged PAC affiliated officers of deliberately stoking peasant fears to sabotage the RCA's efforts at land reform, exploiting their dominance of recently installed local rural leadership councils to undermine the party. The PAC have countered with sordid peasant testimonies of brutality and corruption by party commissars, though it appears too late: once the wheels of party machinery have started there is little stopping it.\n\nMany militias have been ordered to disarm or at least stand down, and Deng Yanda's reputation cut down to size. As the scandal slowly subsides thanks to government censorship and a PAC tactical retreat, the only thing left to deal with is approach. As a second wave of commissars are deployed they have been instructed to..."
CHI.midgame.401.a: "...take a measured, fair approach."
CHI.midgame.401.b: "...harshly crack down on traitors."

CHI.midgame.402.t: "The National Labour Union"
CHI.midgame.402.d: "China's industrialisation has been uneven and heavily concentrated along the coastal cities, but it has been a long-running process facilitated in part due to external investment. The wealth generated however, has been extremely unequal - with much of it flowing out of the country and the rest lining the pockets of comprador bourgeoisie, corrupt magistrates, and warlord armies. Little trickled down to the urban poor, and plenty flocked to the socialist cause when they liberated the land.\n\nThe Kuomintang has sponsored many unions under the banner of their party-controlled \"National Labour Union\" federation in hopes of inspiring the urban proletariat to their cause and under an \"amenable\" leadership. This pliant relationship has been challenged however by the zeal in which many workers and organisers have conducted themselves with. Like a tempest in a bottle, the Kuomintang conquest has been met with the release of considerable pent up frustration from the working class.\n\nSyndicalist groups have jumped on a chance to advance their founding cause, with some reluctance at first but soon with considerable vigour. The worker is a key pillar in the Kuomintang power base, and its Central Executive Committee must certainly act quickly to mold the movement before the moment passes. Either they bind the workers closer to the party or work to redefine their relationship with their sister party."
CHI.midgame.402.a: "Keep a tight grip on Chinese unionism."
CHI.midgame.402.b: "Appoint CSP Intellectuals to NLU Leadership."
CHI.midgame.402.c: "Encourage radical worker action."

CHI.midgame.403.t: "The Syndicalists Flex Their Muscles"
CHI.midgame.403.d: "Escalating Kuomintang rhetoric to fire up the proletariat has not gone unnoticed. Talk of class war and liberation has brought out a revolutionary energy from the workers that exceeds the eager expectations of even the Marxist-inspired leaders of the party. Although many members of the young guard are delighted by this display, seeing it as proof of the Kuomintang's success in bringing a voice to the oppressed, not everyone is as convinced.\n\nParticularly odious to a growing chorus of voices within the party is the independent actions of the CSP-Radicals, who have taken upon themselves to organise the workers with a conviction that sometimes outstrips even Chen Gongbo's faction. There have been growing discussions about striking against even government-operated industry (which the Kuomintang and even some CSP-Orthodox leaders maintain works for the betterment of all of China). Worse, the CSP-Radicals have begun organising militias of their own.\n\nIn their defence, Chen Shaoyu and other leaders insist that corrupt magistrates are the cause of these tensions, and that if the Kuomintang wish to truly win the people's hearts they need to do better. Many agrarian, liberal, and nationalist elements have demanded that they be reigned in for the sake of preserving unity, looking to Deng Yanda to step in their defence. Should he and the PAC fail, there is concern that amidst the rising tensions, they will turn to others for a solution - further dividing the party and pushing it to extremes.\n\nAs Deng presents his solution to the Chairman before the Central Executive Committee, he weighs his next words carefully."
CHI.midgame.403.a: "Work out a reasonable compromise."
CHI.midgame.403.b: "Forcibly disarm the militias."

CHI.midgame.404.t: "The Draft Law on Disposition of Rebel Property"
CHI.midgame.404.d: "To the victors go the spoils, and with the Kuomintang's victory in the Five Provinces they have seized a copious amount of treasure from defeated warlords and fleeing bourgeoisie, even if sizeable quantities have been stolen, evacuated or stashed abroad in advance. In addition to liquid assets such as gold, jewels, and cash, the Kuomintang has nationalised capital infrastructure such as railways, factories, and ports - especially targeting the hated foreign-owned investments of the AOG.\n\nBut, as always in the aftermath of victory, now comes the question of dividing shares. The National Revolutionary Army's commanders and various party commissars have been remarkably disciplined in protecting and cataloguing seized assets to the best of their ability, even as the count goes on and cases of fraud have emerged. But higher up in the chain there has been considerable discussion about how to best allocate the revolutionary's newly acquired bounty. Further discussion is expected, but to begin with, a general direction must be charted."
CHI.midgame.404.a: "Return it to the people."
CHI.midgame.404.b: "Use it to stabilise the government."

CHI.midgame.405.t: "The Needs of the People"
CHI.midgame.405.d: "The Kuomintang's decision to redistribute seized property has proven broadly popular, and the discussion within the halls of power has turned towards how to best enact such a plan. Despite the socialist revolutionaries' egalitarian principles, unfortunately there has already been plenty of backdoor lobbying on where to best spend the influx of League riches. Cases of outright misallocation have been punished, but a focused direction becomes more and more necessary.\n\nAs a general trend, the RCA and their allies in the CSP have pushed for an injection of cash towards urban renewal. In their eyes, winning the urban proletariat is critical for jump-starting industry and giving the production base to win the Kuomintang's future wars. They point out that focusing spending in densely populated areas is more efficient for the limited resources available on hand. The PAC and affiliated factions have called for a distribution of aid for the farmers, who they argue are the backbone of the revolution thus far. With many facing famine conditions thanks to the disruption of war, greater spending there is the only way to bring peace to the countryside and consolidate Kuomintang bastions in the area.\n\nPlenty of moderates would like to do both, and have pushed for relatively even spending - even if it curtails the efficacy of either. They have been joined by a divergent voice coming from the Four Elders, who have stressed also the need for funding museums, conservatories, and other cultural institutions. In their eyes, the poor need not only material assistance but also to be able to appreciate the culture and beauty of their nation if they are to look forward to a new future."
CHI.midgame.405.a: "Focus on empowering the urban worker."
CHI.midgame.405.b: "Focus on alleviating rural poverty."
CHI.midgame.405.c: "Keep things balanced."

CHI.midgame.406.t: "The Needs of the State"
CHI.midgame.406.d: "A broad consensus is that the teetering Kuomintang government requires all the assets it can to prop it up. Since the government represents and is for the people, giving money to the state is the as giving it to the people. And sure enough, an infusion of wealth is the oil needed to grease the cogs of bureaucracy and the fuel to get the machine running.\n\nMetaphors aside, leading financial experts in the government have called for the payment of outstanding debts and to raise funding for the new government bureaucracy. Even in a socialist nation, the former is essential for maintaining faith in the government's ability to honour obligations, both externally and internally with salaries. The latter is vital for keeping the revolution running.\n\nOthers have called for the reopening of factories and the promotion of industrialisation in the country. They argue the return on investment will be high and a powerful industry is important not merely for giving an advantage over our rivals but also for the ultimate success of Chinese socialism.\n\nMembers of the military high command have lobbied for further resources to be applied to their own advanced projects, hoping to facilitate the adoption of modern technologies from abroad to win their wars. In their eyes, all other organs of state can wait until after unification to receive their full due."
CHI.midgame.406.a: "Focus on banks and bureaucracy."
CHI.midgame.406.b: "Focus on industrialising the nation."

#Advisor Triggered Events
CHI.midgame.600.t: "Report from the MMIC"
CHI.midgame.600.d: "In 1927, the Chinese revolution came to an abrupt halt when German intervention helped tilt the scales in favour of reactionary forces in the nation, dashing the hopes of idealists and socialists throughout the land. The Kuomintang and the League of Chinese Syndicalists were scatter to the winds, and the National Revolutionary Army broken.\n\nThis however, was not the end. The NRA proved its valour on the battlefield, a disciplined army trained by experienced socialist officers and educated in socialist doctrine. Initially led by Red Russian émigrés, the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine expanded to include officers from around the Internationale.\n\nBetween 1927-1936, the MMIC continued to train exiled NRA forces, creating a small but elite standing force of Chinese revolutionaries. Chinese operatives were periodically smuggled in and out of China, joining underground resistance movements.\n\nThanks to the inevitable instability caused by capitalist exploitation, the Chinese people finally gained another chance to break their shackles. In a daring, lighting revolt they overran much of China's eastern coastline, creating [CHI.GetNameDef] for which to challenge reactionary rule. The MMIC has been sent to assist them along their revolutionary path. They have eagerly written back home with giddy anticipation, with high hopes for China's future (and their own)."
CHI.midgame.600.FRA: "$CHI.midgame.600.d$\n\nAs the long-time leader of the Internationale, French officers make up a large part of the military mission. André Malraux stands at the helm of the MMIC, an adventurer and writer whose revolutionary activities in the east made him an early candidate for the position. A man of action, thinker, and clever writer - his writings on the situation in China has been well received by the public. Jean Fontenoy, one of his lead deputies in charge of combat training, is sometimes said to be his shadowy reflection - another leftist writer-revolutionary adventurer, undoubtably brave but also addled by opium and with a growing sympathy for totalitarianism."
CHI.midgame.600.ENG: "$CHI.midgame.600.d$\n\nThe deputy head of the mission is David Ramsay, a propagandist and labour organiser. He has thrown himself into his work - hoping to avoid a repeat of what happened in 1927 and in Russia. He and other British officers in the mission often take up major leadership roles, and among them is the young George Hardy Jr, following in his father's footsteps as an advisor for the NRA."
CHI.midgame.600.NOR: "$CHI.midgame.600.d$\n\nAmong our contribution to the mission is one Ingvald Berentin Aase, who has written at length against Norwegian extraterritoriality in China, has been integral in warming ties between ourselves and the Chinese. In his reports home he expresses hope for the end of concessionism across the five provinces."
CHI.midgame.600.HND: "$CHI.midgame.600.d$\n\nThe MMIC is joined by a contingent of Indian advisors, part of our effort to help our fellow Asian anti-imperialists. Led by Manabendra Nath (M.N.) Roy, he has expressed particular interests in the agricultural revolution - pushing for revolutionary action to break the semi-feudal system."
CHI.midgame.600.a: "A Victory for Socialism in the East!"

CHI.midgame.601.t: "The White Sun Rises in the East"
CHI.midgame.601.d: "If there was any doubt about the inescapable tide of history, the almost unstoppable successes of socialist forces in China surely proves it. Inspiring in their tenacity, the National Revolutionary Army has swept across northern China and successfully captured Beijing. This has allowed for [CHI.GetLeader] to deliver a speech before Tiananmen Square, a testament to the growing power of [CHI.GetNameDef].\n\nThese successes however, has not blinded their advisors in the MMIC from the realities the party still faces. With every passing day, [CHI.GetNameDef] is increasingly recognised as the legitimate government of China, a heavy burden to bear. Reactionary warlord forces within the country are likely to strike before the Kuomintang can consolidate their grip, and imperialist nations are weighing their options. Meanwhile, the Kuomintang are forced to contend with the perils of national leadership - including growing expectations from the people.\n\nWithin the party, divisions are growing. Wang Jingwei is beset with foes within the party, who are searching for an opportunity to depose him. Other advisors within the MMIC report a growing feud between mission head André Malraux and Deng Yanda, a prominent NRA general accused of leading a subversive clique of officers. Deng, they warn, is hardly the only one however willing to defy Wang's authority, or consolidating power around him."
CHI.midgame.601.a: "Heavy is the head that wears the crown."

CHI.midgame.602.t: "The Reclus Plan"
CHI.midgame.602.d: "The growing influence of the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine within the ranks of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army has opened up new opportunities, but also plenty of risk. Aid to [CHI.GetNameDef] has been limited by the long distance and our own equipment needs, but with modern equipment scarce in the Chinese theatre even a small amount can go a long way in elevating the fighting quality of Chinese units.\n\nOur advisors in the MMIC frequently harp on the possibility of a coup in the near future, even as they disagree about the likely source. André Malraux's personal animosity with Deng Yanda has drawn suspicion towards the WMARCA faction of the army, which unfortunately dominates the Old Guard along with the so-called \"India Clique\". He and many MMIC officers have supported the development of the \"Political Department\", affiliated with the civilian establishment and part of the NRA's \"Young Guard\". Others however believe we should back a horse other than the increasingly authoritarian Wang Jingwei, believing that empowering independent Syndicalist officers will help secure the long-term longevity and democracy of the Chinese revolution.\n\nJacques Reclus, a French anarchist that has joined the mission initially as an interpreter, has proposed a plan to divert weapons shipments towards sympathetic units in the NRA. The syndicalist movement in China is divided into factions of its own, and Reclus is connected to the (New) World Society faction, but most have traditionally found themselves sidelined by the NRA establishment regardless of affiliation. Helping support syndicalist led units would increase its influence but draw Old Guard ire.\n\nHearing of this plan, others have proposed modifying it to support their favourites in the Political Department. They see them the safer bet, given their status as a known quality within the army and the plan will likely receive the blessing of Chairman Wang."
CHI.midgame.602.a: "Aid the Political Department."
CHI.midgame.602.b: "Aid the Chinese Syndicalists."

CHI.midgame.603.t: "Ascendancy of the Political Department"
CHI.midgame.603.d: "Officers connected to the \"Political Department\" clique has had it's share of recent successes as of late, almost definitely thanks to the patronage of the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine. Most are \"Young Guard\" officers, trained in the Whampoa-in-exile, and taught the latest in military theory. Units associated with them have been chosen for important tasks and armed with the army's limited support of Western arms.\n\nThis has given Wang Jingwei the excuse he has needed to elevate them to positions of greater authority, promoting them to important staff and command posts at the expense of \"Old Guard\" affiliated officers. This has shored up the RCA's position within the military, a blow to the hopes of those hoping to capitalise on the RCA's military weakness for their own nefarious ends.\n\nZhou Enlai and his protege Nie Rongzhen have benefited from these developments as the ring-leaders of the clique. Nie in particular has been seen much more in public, shaking hands and rubbing shoulders with important civilian and military figures. Their rivals may be fuming, but there is little they can do about it - for now."
CHI.midgame.603.a: "A new generation of Chinese officers."

CHI.midgame.604.t: "The Reclus Affair"
CHI.midgame.604.d: "The National Revolutionary Army and their Internationale advisors have had a long history, but not always a positive one. In the Guangzhou period, they frequently sided with the left against Chiang Kai-shek's faction and even with the purge of right-wing elements it seems that the tensions continue into another decade.\n\nJacques Reclus is a French anarchist and a late-comer to the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine. More of a teacher and an intellectual, it appears he has tried his hand at scheming... unsuccessfully. A whistle-blower within the supply corps has accused him of redirecting valuable Western supply-shipments to Syndicalist aligned units, hoping to forestall a coup by the \"Old Guard\".\n\nInstead however, he has found himself at the centre of the latest source of tension between the military brass and their advisors. Deng Yanda has thrown his weight around, seeing an opportunity to undermine his rival André Malraux (whose direct involvement is questionable) and lambaste the lack of formal training of many MMIC leaders. In an unauthorised public appearance, he has even publicly raised the question of the necessity of the MMIC, arguing at this point their political (rather than military) training has done more harm than good. He has excoriated the politicisation of military affairs, demanding national unity in these troubling times.\n\nThe irony of the statement appears to have been lost on Deng, but that is the least of Wang Jingwei's worries. He and his inner circle were slighted by the MMIC's decision to side-step them in their plan, undermining his authority. The more obvious course of action would be to simply declare Reclus a persona non grata, despite the pleas of some of his anarchist friends in the World Society, sending him home to Paris. On the other hand, it does seem like Deng has gone too far this time, his premature celebration an interference in an active investigation. Perhaps this is the time to cut him down to size."
CHI.midgame.604.a: "Expel Reclus."
CHI.midgame.604.b: "Humble Deng."

CHI.midgame.605.t: "Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association"
CHI.midgame.605.d: "Whampoa was more than a mere school. Built in a small island in Guangzhou, it was the site where aspiring young revolutionaries trained not only in military tactics but also in ideology. The spirit, dedication, and camaraderie built in those halls has few equals, even if the physical site was only used for less than a decade. It is no surprise then that Whampoa has spawned multiple fraternities, close networks of alumni and former instructors bonded effectively for life through triumphs and tragedies.\n\nAlumni affiliations tend to be fluctuating, with far less clear divisions between \"left\" and \"right\" as it may superficially appear. Headmaster Chiang Kai-shek, for example, had many admirers among leftist cadets for his commitment to action and focus on battlefield spirit. But he has since passed on - resigned the mixed memory of history - the new man of the hour is no other than General Deng Yanda, himself a prominent instructor.\n\nHe commands a large following, perhaps the alumni network - the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association (WMARCA). Despite their affiliation with the \"Old Guard\" of the army, WMARCA also includes many promising young commanders such as Huang Qixiang, Wang Yaowu, and Du Yuming. They often dominated the upper ranks of the MinGan insurgency, a fact that they have been accused of leveraging to ensure favourable promotions for insiders. The WMARCA however, see themselves as the true bearers of the Whampoa spirit - courageous defenders of the revolution, the people, and the Three Principles."
CHI.midgame.605.a: "Fraternity, Devotion, Sincerity."

CHI.midgame.606.t: "What does the Kuomintang Represent"
CHI.midgame.606.d: "With his recent premiership solidified, Chen Gongbo has officially announced the publication of his new treatise \"What does the Kuomintang Represent.\" Chen begins with an attack on Deng Yanda, Sun Fo, the Four Elders, and others for having encouraged party factionalism and thus losing the Party's capacity to lead the national revolution. In common Reorganisationist rhetoric, he advocates for an intensive house cleaning of the party while rejecting calls for a new Party or separate party.\n\nIn his recent work, Chen has assigned the Kuomintang, three missions: a national revolution, a world revolution, and a cultural revolution. China after all is not a colony nor is it a nation, rather it is an international colony - with losses in its financial, territorial, and judicial sphere. As an economist by background, he considers the loss of financial sovereignty the most painful of China's weaknesses. Chen believes that during the Great War, Britain's imperialistic domination of the world had been shaken dramatically but Germany's ultimate victory meant a revival of capitalism and reaction. This, he argues, explains why postwar Germany is governed for the most part by conservatives (the Zentrum government) and why Germany was leading Europe in a bulwark of reaction. Germany's intervention in the Northern Expedition therefore represents the reactionary imperialists attempting to stifle the natural progression of history.\n\nBut China's enemies do not lie purely with the German Eagle. Chen warns of the ever-hungry ambitions of the Empire of Japan, with Japan's presence in Manchuria a presence that must be dealt with during the National Revolution. As long as these two nations exist in China, there can be no freedom from economic imperialism - no end to a century of humiliation. By upholding a firm stance of anti-imperialism against two of China's greatest enemies, this is what the KMT should represent argues Chen."
CHI.midgame.606.a: "Chen is the right hand man for a reason!"

CHI.midgame.607.t: "The All China Democratic Women's Federation"
CHI.midgame.607.d: "An early feminist and revolutionary, He Xiangning has ascended to the Central Committee as one of the elders of the Party due to her connections with the late Dr. Sun and her own personal friendship with Song Qingling. Despite the recent passing of her beloved husband, she has nonetheless conveyed the opinion that she is not yet done with her revolutionary work and is an active member within the Party.\n\nAlong with other feminists and female comrades  such as Zeng Xing, Song Qingling, Deng Yingchao, and Cai Chang - He has recently ascended to the position of Chairwoman of the recently established All-China Democratic Women's Federation (ACDWF). The federation's goal (in the spirit of local democracy) is to unite various regional women's groups with the dual goals of building a socialist China and also to promote the status of women. Along with socialist youth groups for young girls, the ACDWF has also been instrumental in establishing various hospitals and schools for women within [CHI.GetNameDef]. With the help of He Xiangning, the ACDWF has also been at work in organising Red Cross units composed of working class women to work with the National Revolutionary Army so that both men and women can fight for a free China together."
CHI.midgame.607.a: "The women of China yearn for liberation!"

CHI.midgame.608.t: "The Revolutionary Three Principles of the People"
CHI.midgame.608.d: "While he may have flirted with anarchism in his youth, aside from Chen Gongbo within the RCA, no one is more infatuated with Marxism and materialism than Shi Cuntong, also known as Shi Fuliang. An early pioneer in the Chinese syndicalist movement, Shi is also known to hold connections and ties to Japanese leftists; However, he grew dissatisfied with the Chinese Syndicalist Party's leadership under Chen Duxiu and instead joined the Kuomintang.\n\nAs a member of the RCA's Radical wing and one of its most prolific writers, Shi's radicalism is considered to even surpass that of Chen Gongbo's. Shi writes that the Party should be democratised and linked with the masses with elections instituted at every level of party hierarchy. After all, it is the Party's blind faith in Bonapartists such as Deng Yanda or idealistic fools such as Sun Fo that has led to a degeneration in the national revolution. If the KMT is to emerge victorious, it must adopt a new revolutionary platform with a new revolutionary Three Principles of the People - Shi argues that the late Dr. Sun's doctrine could indeed be interpreted by materialism.\n\nShi profusely believes that class conflict is inevitable. In his view, Chinese society is dominated by imperialism - a feudal and patriarchal society. Within the feudal class there are warlord bureaucrats like Wu Peifu and Zhang Zuolin and the landlords; these classes collaborated with imperialism and sold out the nation for self-interest. The bourgeoisie would not participate in the revolution even if they once had; the bourgeoisie and compradors were already economically subservient to imperialism. Basing his observations on the 1932 uprising, Shi believes that the workers are at the forefront of the revolutionary movement, the future vanguard to lead China into national salvation."
CHI.midgame.608.a: "Hear Hear!"

CHI.midgame.609.t: "Wheeling and Dealing in Shanghai"
CHI.midgame.609.d: "Shanghai is in many ways the beating heart of the Chinese economy, and home to various groups both esteemed and unsavoury. The centre of Chinese trade, commerce, and finance it attracts individuals and groups from all walks of life. As a result, it has become a nexus point - a place where nationalists, republicans, and even socialists can gather in secluded spaces to talk business. The Kuomintang have long operated out of Shanghai, even with the creation of the International Mandate. Although Legation authorities periodically try to crack down on our activities, in such a big city it is easy to find a friend.\n\nChen Youren, who also goes by his birth name of Eugene depending on the circumstances, has plenty of experience navigating through this world, an estuary of revolution, crime, and privilege. As the foreign minister for a government seldom recognised by reactionary powers, he has nonetheless been careful to steer clear of KMT and LCS cells or the various gangs the revolution has periodically partnered with. Instead he has worked to solicit support from various upper-class contacts, ones the MinGan insurgency have previously worked with to keep them funded.\n\nAlthough divergent in their ultimate end goals, many of China's elites are nationalistic and republican. Although their views on the party have dimmed since the enthusiasm of 1911, plenty remain at least open to outreach either out of habit or idealism. With some careful choice of words and a rosy outlook, it is not difficult to secure their support. What's more intriguing is the growing number of aspiring contacts - people who wish to \"run with the wolves\" so to speak and be on the winning side. Various members of the Overseas Chinese Commission and members of the Vermillion Society have eagerly sought Chen's audience ever since our various victories across the nation."
CHI.midgame.609.a: "With a firm grip and a bright smile!"
CHI.midgame.609.b: "With a polite tone and calculated restraint."

CHI.midgame.610.t: "The Crown Prince's Clique"
CHI.midgame.610.d: "It would be a mistake to dismiss Sun Fo as another dilettante, a mere product of nepotism coasting on his father's legacy. While there is little doubt that the younger Sun lives in his father's shadow, he is also himself an accomplished politician, scholar, and legislator. Often bucking with the socialist orthodoxy, he has marched to his own step and gathered an alliance of those who claim to be loyal to the original ideals of the party and the \"true\" teachings of Dr. Sun.\n\nSun Fo (who prefers the Cantonese spelling of his name over the Mandarin Sun Ke) got his start in independent leadership as the Mayor of Guangzhou, then the revolutionary headquarters of the party. Serving multiple terms, he was expected to squeeze out resources from the city to furnish his father's army with supplies, but also proved to be an energetic administrator as well. He oversaw multiple grand infrastructure projects, the modernisation of legal codes, overhauled the bureaucracy, implemented some local democracy (albeit still under tutelage), and hoped to do so much more.\n\nAlthough ultimately he fell short of his ambitions, his driven but idealistic nature attracted like-minded souls to his side. This faction, then dubbed the \"Crown Prince Clique\" included close friends and fellow foreign-educated young intellectuals like Liang Hancao, Huang Hanliang, Wang Kunlun, and Wu Chaoshu (C.C. Wu). Time has aged all of them, and even now having morphed into the \"Reconstruction Faction\" they still feel like outsiders looking in to their own party. But in their quest to save their nation and the party of the Eternal Premier, they will push forward against all odds."
CHI.midgame.610.a: "They're not in Honolulu any more."

CHI.midgame.611.t: "The National Labour University"
CHI.midgame.611.d: "A long-held aspiration of the World Society was the creation of an institute modelled around one established in 1902 in Charleroi, Belgium. This University would be one for the workers, helping to mend class divisions by combining labour and education to allow for the creation of the \"labouring intellectual\". Fittingly, their slogan is to \"turn schools into factories and fields, and fields and factories into schools\", a high-minded aspiration meant to lay the groundwork for a peaceful future transition to anarchist state.\n\nCai Yuanpei, a leading Chinese educator and one of the \"Four Elders\" that make up the World Society, heads the preparatory committee for this university. With the help of their protege Yi Peiji, an educator now appointed as President of the University, they aspire to turn the National Labour University into a continuation of the old Frugal Work-Study Programme in France that generated so many idealists now in the party.\n\nThe institution is beset by problems, though none unsurmountable. Funding has been generously provided recently by the government, and there does seem to be a genuine eagerness even by rivals within the party for more universities accessible to the poor farmers and labourers who otherwise would not be able to afford an education. Still, their ambition to teach an anarchist interpretation of the Three Principles have raised eyebrows. In response, they cite examples of Dr. Sun's lectures that praise Proudhon and Bakunin over the Marxists.

CHI.midgame.612.t: "The Labour of Hound and Horse"
CHI.midgame.612.d: "Dai Chunfeng was raised by a single mother, a woman who instilled in him a ceaseless drive for power but also a certain sense of Confucian filial piety - a loyalty that seems to carry over to the masters he latches on to. His latest one might very well be his ticket to the very heights of power in China. Dai sees his relationship to Hu Zongnan as akin the ones found in the ancient classics, conducting the \"labour of hound and horse\" (a reference to Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang) with utter loyalty for General Hu. Like the noble heroes of old, Dai's fealty to Hu begets his own expectations of nigh-feudal obligation from his own subordinates, and also his own expectation of requited honour from his master.\n\nOn a personal level, Dai lives alone with his guards and his servant Jia Jinnan, moving frequently between various safe-houses and residences so no one quite knows where he is. His leadership is personal, stressing (almost exaggeratedly) military discipline and relying on his nearly boundless energy, high attention to detail, and calculating mind. He prefers to use his own prodigious memory over modern filing systems, and works sometimes days on end.\n\nOn the other hand, he is also said to be erratic and paranoid at times, and a heavy drinker - unwilling to delegate out tasks to his warring lieutenants and clashing with Hu's other deputies. For his talk of humility and submission, he is not afraid to spread the word of his brutality - creating a very public image of a monster ruthlessly carrying out his master's tasks. There are very few willing to cross the \"Laoban\", and Hu Zongnan has found a very useful companion in him."

CHI.midgame.613.d: "During the exile period, Song Ziwen made himself busy in Shanghai. While his sister continued to fight her revolution on the battlefields of MinGan, Song spent his time gathering money for her cause - but also thinking far ahead into the future. He has travelled around the world as an exile, making correspondences with fellow financial experts and economic planners. Few could have predicted the Kuomintang would ever return to this scale, so Song's work is either evidence of his foresight or arrogance.\n\nAll the same, one high profile exile he happened to have met was the Frenchman Jean Monnet, through a mutual contact in Ludwik Rajchman. They conceived of an idea for a channel for foreign financing into China, allowing them to promote major investments from abroad to stabilise the economy. However, given the anti-concessionist sentiment present after the 1936 Wuhu Incident, it has been decided that such funding must come from within China only.\n\nWith the help of the Song family's extensive connections, Song Ziwen's personal status as Minister of Finance, and party leadership like Li Shizeng, the Chinese Development Finance Corporation has been established. With the help of major allied banks in China, they have sought to finance major infrastructure, business, and resource extraction projects across the nation - a first step in the national reconstruction.\n\nUsing a public-private model, their efforts have been hampered by the realities of war but have helped support the Kuomintang's efforts at diminishing their reliance on Imperialist powers for capital. If things go the way Song hopes, this may be the foundation on which the party's state-capitalist programme is built upon."

#Cultural Event Chain
CHI.midgame.800.t: "Interpreting the New Culture Movement"
CHI.midgame.800.d: "\"A society of art for art's sake,\" say the leftist writers who argue that the National Revolution of the Chinese Revolution is not merely a revolution against imperialism or society but rather a revolution of culture. In the early days, these so-called \"new writers\" found themselves drawn to romanticism as opposed to naturalism - advocating art for art's sake and emphasising the individual, Following the tragedy of the Shanghai Massacre on May 30th, leftist journalists, artists, writers began to gravitate towards the proletarian movement - art was to be a tool in the natural dialectic Marxist progression of the social revolution.\n\nLed by artistic intellectuals such as Guo Moruo, Chang Fangwu, and Yu Dafu have organised themselves in an artistic circle known as the Creation Society with other prominent socialists to write on and critique Chinese society as well as to address the future proletarian revolution. They are also joined by groups such as the League of Left-Wing Writers in the Legation Cities, with the Legation Cities being a prominent hotbed of left-wing literary and cinematic activity due to the perceived capitalistic oppression of foreign imperialism.\n\nWithin the Kuomintang, more radical Marxists in the Party, such as those amongst the RCA, have clamoured for the observance of Karl Marx's birthday, May Day, and the anniversary of the Paris Commune. For the Provisional Action Committee, however, while the clique openly supports leftist art and culture - they have nonetheless shown opposition and fear of ideologues like Chen Gongbo, who advocate for the necessity of a cultural revolution. Citing that the social revolution and revolution against imperialism are more important in the here and now, they have denounced Chen's suggestions for a revolution against existing cultural institutions."

CHI.midgame.801.t: "A Vibrant Leftist Culture"
CHI.midgame.801.d: "As the poor peasant has come to symbolise within the revolutionary left the nature of the oppressed Chinese countryman, leftist artists have turned to create works of revolutionary art to portray their struggles, poverty, and potential for greatness.\n\nPrevalent within the artistic community is a group of woodcarvers encouraged by the esteemed leftist writer Lu Xun. Lu Xun publicly endorsed woodcarving as he felt that the brush swabs of traditional Chinese painting and the eloquence of Western oil painting did not care too much about social reality; meanwhile, woodcarving is close to life and readily accepted by the masses. Moreover, this is also simply for the reason that \"woodcarving is easy to do.\" In 1931, an art exhibition was held in Shanghai which displayed some woodcarving works by young left-wing artists,\n\nSince the Kuomintang's explosive victory in the League War, woodcarvers have turned to portray the struggle of the peasants as their main foci. This is seen at the titles of their works which mainly deal with floods and famines; for example, the artist Duan Ganqing has produced two works: \"Life After a Great Disaster,\" \"Where is Our Home,\" and \"Famine.\" Meanwhile, writing on the poor Sichuan harvest, works have been created in response to the depravity of famine conditions: \"The Symphony of Hunger\" (Zhang Ying), \"Collapse on the Road because of Hunger\" (Zhang Hui), \"The Hungry Throng\" (Luo Qingzhen)."
CHI.midgame.801.a: "Fascinating!"

CHI.midgame.802.t: "The Liberal Outpost"
CHI.midgame.802.d: "Despite being largely sidelined from major policymaking decisions by the Kuomintang's leftist leadership due to his right-leaning beliefs, that has not stopped Sun Fo from being busy in his lifelong goal of promoting his father's teachings (through the lens of his own interpretation of his father's will). In some ways, carrying on the burden of preserving and disseminating his father's work is a means for which the younger Sun connects with his distant parent beyond the grave.\n\nAside from his activities in the government, legislature, and party politics, Sun Fo has also been a noted sponsor for culture. His lieutenants Chong Tianxin and Huang Shenji have formed the Chinese Cultural Association which publishes the magazine \"Creation\". Their most recent endeavour, however, far outstrips a petty magazine in ambition. The Sun Yat-sen Institute for the Advancement of Culture and Education aims to study Dr. Sun's ideas in relationship to general Chinese culture.\n\nAlthough it has received praise (albeit muted) from party leaders, its actual agenda of rallying liberal scholars and thinkers together has cast suspicion about Sun's ambitions. Sun has expressed in private his desire to attract the youth away from what he sees as Marxist influence back towards the Three Principles. The institute has announced plans to release an English-language journal called Tianxia Monthly, no doubt to sway foreign opinion, and a domestic oriented \"Compilation of Current Events\".\n\nContaining its influence however, in the end might simply just be a matter of ignoring it. Although Sun insists that the institute be funded through private donations as a means of maintaining a reputation for impartiality and independence from the government, in practice he has leveraged his sway over the Executive Yuan and municipal governments for donations. This money has allowed the Institute to secure the contribution of famous scholars, and quietly turning the faucet off would choke their activities."

CHI.midgame.803.t: "Censorship and the Arts"
CHI.midgame.803.d: "As the Revolution continues, the grinding gears of state machinery often takes an oppressive form. Long accustomed to evading reactionary censorship, with the shoe now on the other foot the Kuomintang has not hesitated to suppress media unfavourable to their cause. A myriad of restrictions have slowly been put into place, either officially or unofficially, and censors deployed into relevant telegraph stations. With many rural citizens illiterate, Kuomintang control of information can be concentrated in the cities.\n\nThe Central Executive Committee has passed the Revised Standards for News Censorship, giving considerable authority to the Central News Agency in setting guidelines for all newspapers. Censors often have wide latitude in interpreting restrictions, causing a race for publishers to find ways around them. What's perhaps interesting too is that such aggressive government actions against \"counter-revolutionary\" works seems to have rubbed off on the students, who also regularly target critical press on their own initiative.\n\nIn the world of culture, there have been plenty of artists of all types sympathetic to the revolution. Many however have chafed under these restrictions, and complain the Kuomintang are little better than their predecessors. Indeed, many publishing companies have begun to self-censor out of fear of offending government sensibilities. Although at this point most have given up on halting the government from suppressing public criticism, prominent intellectuals have made the case that the arts require at least some creative freedom - particularly those aligned with revolutionary values."

#Revolutionary Literature Event Chain
CHI.midgame.805.t: "Revolution and Thought"
CHI.midgame.805.d: "Within the Reorganised Comrades Association, few can hardly dispute that the clique's primary ideological stance is guided by none other than Chen Gongbo, the dynamic revolutionary socialist who studied Economics at Columbia University from 1922-1924.  Associated with syndicalists early on in his political career and a founding member of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, Chen developed a passionate interest in Marxism while overseas. Intellectually, he describes himself as believing in \"historicism,\" a common euphemism for Marx's materialism - like all orthodox Marxists, Chen holds that politics and institutions are merely the reflections of economic structures.\n\nA frequent publisher in the Revolutionary Critic, Chen has recently published his magnum opus - \"Revolution and Thought.\" In this work, he coined the expression \"dynamic materialism\" to describe his weltanschauung (world-view), holding that matter and motion are the basic constituents of the world.\n\nIn the concluding passages of his work, Chen notes that he had originally found fault with Marx's writings that capitalism would lead to its destruction. After all, he pointed out that although the Great War - Germany had survived and sustained itself, exploiting their colonies strengthened capitalism, an idea never anticipated by Marx. However, with the recent collapse of the German economy following Black Monday, Chen writes that for China to be free, she must pursue her own independent revolutionary direction, and the KMT party organ must be reorganised to perfection to execute such anti-imperialism. With the demise of capitalism world wide, Chen muses - there is finally a chance for the National Revolution to succeed."
CHI.midgame.805.a: "A brilliant writer, that Chen Gongbo!"
CHI.midgame.805.b: "That's interesting but we've got a war to fight."

CHI.midgame.806.t: "On Historical Materialism"
CHI.midgame.806.d: "Described as the second most prominent intellectual within the Reorganised Comrades Association and the de facto leader of the RCA \"Moderates\", Gu Mengyu was never a Marxist-oriented intellectual like his radical peers in the RCA. Prior to joining the Kuomintang in early 1925, Gu was a registrar and head of the economics department of Peking University. While he holds a good understanding of Marxism, he does not subscribe to materialism, nor did he think that economic structures were the primary factor in understanding history.\n\nIn his new work \"On Historical Materialism\", he disputes the validity of dialectical and historical materialism earning harsh criticism and woeful boos from the Radical Faction of the RCA. Gu writes the evidence presented by Marx and Engels were merely metaphysics and that dialectical materialism unlocking the logic of nature was just a form of metaphysics since it is not based on empirical grounds. As to historical materialism, Gu did not think that economic structures were the ultimate determinant for superstructure. He argues that human knowledge, science, education, and ethics play just as an important role on economic development.\n\nDenouncing orthodox Marxism as \"a religious doctrine\", Gu's writings have earned acclaim from non-Marxists within the Kuomintang and those in the RCA who do not subscribe to the ideas of materialism. Despite praise from his camp, sales for \"On Historical Materialism\" have nonetheless fallen short compared to the popularity of Chen Gongbo's latest work."
CHI.midgame.806.a: "Gu makes an excellent point!"

CHI.midgame.807.t: "Thoughts on March 8"
CHI.midgame.807.d: "Despite her \"bourgeoisie\" background as the daughter of a gentry family, Ding Ling, born Jiang Bingzhi, studied at the progressive Hunan Provincial No.1 Normal School for Girls, where she became classmates with her future revolutionary comrade Xiang Jingyu. Inspired by her mother, from an early start - Ding Ling found her calling in the politics of the national and social revolution.\n\nInvolved in left-wing circles and acquainted with figures such as Qu Qiubai and her future husband Hu Yepin; Ding nevertheless maintained her own feminist stance by even initially turning down Hu's marriage proposals as a way to demonstrate her own free will. Associated with the so-called \"New Women's Movement\" in literature, her book \"Miss Sophia's Diary\" caused a sensation within the Chinese literary world for its provocative nature of sexuality and emotional desires. Despite her presence in Shanghai, Ding Ling herself travelled to the MinGan insurgent zone to observe the status and role of women in the national revolution; following her journey, she has recently published her magnum opus \"Thoughts on March 8th\" regarding women in the MinGan Zone.\n\nPrefacing her essay by emphasising that women in the MinGan zone hold better lives than women of other provinces of China - women in the MinGan zone have yet to achieve total liberation from their presupposed beliefs that they must bear children and be in marriage. As a self-declared \"Syndicalist\", she covers controversial topics such as the right to remain unmarried, the right to divorce, and the right to abortion. She then describes how women can improve their mental and physical well-being as a means of feminist empowerment before describing that women must not wait to be saved but must take it upon themselves to achieve revolution, even if that means going against the Kuomintang and other revolutionary parties. While acclaimed by feminists, Ding Ling's work has undoubtedly aroused irritation and criticism from more conservative elements of the revolution."
CHI.midgame.807.a: "The women's revolution is coming!"

CHI.midgame.808.t: "The Datong in Socialist Thought"
CHI.midgame.808.d: "The term and notion of the datong can be traced back to the Liji (Book of Rites), where it denotes a world of harmony and universal welfare based on the unselfish behavior of all members of society. Throughout the centuries of Chinese civilisation, this idea of datong was revived and by the late 19th century, it was being incorporated into the concepts of Chinese revolutionaries and reformers.\n\nA common term in anarchist, socialist, and even Marxist texts - datong has been used to describe a future socialist society. The Marxist writer and syndicalist Guo Moruo's essay \"Marx Enters the Confucian Temple\", imagines an encounter between Confucius and Marx where the philosophers agree that their ideas are compatible. A term popular amongst the Provisional Action Committee who cite Dr. Sun's own usage of datong in the Party's anthem, the term is also popular amongst the Party's anarchist elders in the World Society. According to Li Shizeng, history moves in revolutions with the first revolution being monarchical revolution, the revolution for people's sovereignty, the revolution for class, and the final revolution for the datong. Of these revolutions: the establishment of the archaic Shang and Zhou dynasties fit the first revolution; the American, French, and Xinhai revolutions were of the second type; the Syndicalist Revolutions of France and Britain were the third types, and the final revolution is to come - the revolution advocated by Proudhon which carries out the ideals of Minsheng according to Dr. Sun.\n\nTo the Chinese Syndicalist Party, while the datong represents an ideal society without current ills, it also is inspired by the Commune of France, the first state to put socialism into practice. Generally speaking these writers converge on a vision of an industrialised China based on the \"masses\", guided by worker's unions, and with social/cultural facilities available to all. In this world, there shall be economic planning, industrialisation, agricultural collectivisation, the socialisation of property, social infrastructures, the rights and duties for all to work, and equal political statuses. The French method will inspire cities across China, luscious and green neighbourhood \"garden cities\" - the ideal utopia for a true syndicalist China."

CHI.midgame.809.t: "Creation of the CCBS"
CHI.midgame.809.d: "Following the successful First Repatriated Congress and the conclusion of the League War, the Nationalist government has immediately made efforts to establish its hold over Chinese minds and hearts. Delegates affiliated with both the Provisional Action Committee and Reorganised Comrades Association readily agreed that extensive radio broadcasting must be utilised in order to promote the danghua - the \"party-fication\" of Chinese society.\n\nOne of the Ministry's first accomplishments thus far was the revitalisation of the \"Minguo Ribao\" or the \"People's Daily.\" Established as early as 1923 when the Nationalist Party was based in Shanghai, the newspaper was forced to flee overseas upon the failure of the Northern Expedition. Written in the Chinese vernacular, the Minguo Ribao is to be one pillar in the Nationalist propaganda system, placed under the guidance of the Central Daily News and the Central News Agency.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Communications opened a new bureaucratic office named the Telecommunications Office to handle radio communication and broadcasting. Initial plans drawn up with the help of Western engineers have ambitiously envisioned a 500-watt transmitter covering the area between Nanjing and Shanghai. Designed to facilitate the organisation of local level party work as well as commence the danghua, the effort to improve communications throughout the country has so far exceeded expectations.\n\nWith growing excitement, those fluent and literate in the Nanjing Dialect of Mandarin have been encouraged to serve as technicians in the growing number of radio stations throughout the country, emphasising its expanding reach. Recognising the successes of these efforts, President [CHI.GetLeader] will officiate a special ceremony tonight renaming the Nationalist radio station to the China Central Broadcasting System."

CHI.midgame.810.d: "Today saw the premiere of one of the first feature films created under Kuomintang rule. Directed by Bu Wancang and with young Chen Yunchang playing the lead, Mulan Cong Jun (Mulan Joins the Army) is a historical period drama based on the legend of Hua Mulan. In a show of filial piety, she joins the army in her father's place (disguising herself as a man) and courageously helps fight off invading barbarian nomads. Throughout she demonstrates her heroism, courage, and humility.\n\nHailing traditional virtues of honour and valour, the film was an immediate success and raised patriotic feelings throughout the nation. It has broken records for how long it was in theatres, and caused an inevitable flood of comparisons to the current Chinese situation, with the nation still reeling from years of foreign violations of its sovereignty. Other themes of feminism and duty have also proven popular, and spawned continuing discussion about the role women should play in a changing Chinese society."

CHI.midgame.811.d: "A new slapstick comedy has emerged from the theatres from director Shen Xiling and starring Bai Yang and Zhao Dan. While comedic in nature, critics have pointed out that the film seems to take on political undertones in regard to the instability of Chinese politics and the rising threat of Japan.\n\nIt begins in a dock in Shanghai, where college graduate Xu is contemplating suicide when his friend Zhao (played by the notable Zhao Dan) leads him back to their apartment. We learn that these friends are unemployed in Shanghai as a result of the financial fiasco of Black Monday that severely depleted the city's economic strength. Meanwhile, a female graduate Yang (played by Bai Yang) moves next to Zhao as Zhao finds a job in the Minguo Ribao of the Kuomintang. A light-hearted feud breaks out between the two neighbours.\n\nHowever, what has become a light romance between Zhao and Yang, suddenly ends when Yang announces to Zhao one day that she is leaving Shanghai as the factory that she had been working in, had closed down. Zhao tries to convince Yang to stay but she decides to leave anyway. Yang's friend, who recognises their romance, convinces Yang to stay in Shanghai.\n\nZhao finds that he himself is out of work. He meets Yang and the two read in the newspaper, that Zhao's friend Xu had indeed committed suicide.

CHI.midgame.812.d: "A tragedy has emerged in the Chinese literary world today, as the great leftist writer Lu Xun has suddenly died, perhaps as a result of his long-standing habit of being a heavy smoker. Just last year, he developed chronic tuberculosis and for the past few weeks, he has been in declining health. The Nationalist government officially offered their condolences.\n\nLu Xun began his literary career as did any other Chinese intellectual of the pre-Republican era, by studying the Confucian classics in preparation for the civil examinations. Lu Xun's father and grandfather were caught in a bribery scandal that saw his grandfather imprisoned and his father falling victim to a cruel addiction to opium. After attending school where he became exposed to Western ideals, Lu Xun travelled to Japan in 1902 on a government scholarship and began translating famous Western works into vernacular Chinese.\n\nUpon witnessing a photograph of a Chinese civilian being beheaded by a Japanese soldier during the Russo-Japanese War and seeing the utter apathy in the eyes of the Chinese bystanders, Lu Xun was convinced that China was in need of salvation. By the time the Xinhai Revolution arrived in 1911, he had ascended to a position of scholarship in Beijing. In 1917, he began writing for Chen Duxiu's \"New Youth\" where he published his successful short story \"Diary of a Madman.\" He followed this success in 1927 with his grand work, \"The True Story of Ah Q.\"\n\nA sympathetic individual towards the Kuomintang, Lu Xun served as a guest lecturer at Whampoa and the Zhongshan University on the eve of the Northern Expedition. After the expedition's failure, he fled for Shanghai although he remained sympathetic to Song Qingling's guerrilla war in Fujian. Upon the return of the Kuomintang in Nanjing after the League War, he sent Song a telegram, congratulating the National Revolutionary Army for its success."

CHI.midgame.813.d: "A new film has emerged within Chinese cinemas! This new cinematic masterpiece, which has been declared China's first horror film, is directed by the leftist-leaning director Ma-Xu Weibang. It draws influence from the 1923 American film \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" and the 1910 French novel, \"Le Fantôme de l'Opera.\"\n\nCritics of the film have pointed out that the anxious tones of the horror genre seem to emulate the very anxiety the Chinese people hold in regard to the ever-changing political landscape of the land. Furthermore, the film's leftist and nationalist characters have led to the Kuomintang officially endorsing the film.\n\nStarring the handsome actor Jin Shan as Song Danping and the beautiful actress Hu Ping as Li Xiaoxia (Song Danping's lover), the film is set on a dark and stormy night in 1926. A group of actors arrive at a demolished theatre and begin practising for their show. One night, the play's lead, Sun Xiao'ou requests to practise his parts by himself, but he struggles with the lines. As he continues to rehearse, a mysterious voice suddenly lends its voice to the actor, helping him learn the lines. The actor decides to seek out this benevolent angel and finds that the voice belongs to none other than the famed actor Song Danping, who was thought to have been deceased.\n\nIn flashbacks, Danping reveals that prior to acting he had been a revolutionary in the Second Revolution against Yuan Shikai. After the revolution's failure, he fled into hiding and fell in love with Li Xiaoxia. Danping's rival Tang Jun, however, has Danping tortured and attacked with acid. Embarrassed and ashamed of his visceral scars, Danping flees into hiding once more - which drives Xiaoxia to insanity. He spends his nights in the theatre, alone and hidden, comforting a mentally unstable Xiaoxia.\n\nIn the present day, the actor troupe makes it to their show and presents it to none other than the theatre's owner, Tang Jun. Tang takes a liking to Sun's girlfriend and tries to seize her when Sun fights back. In the struggle, Sun's lover dies but Danping emerges out of hiding to fight Tang Jun. The theatre viewers see Danping as a monster due to his disfigured face and attempt to chase him with torches.

CHI.midgame.814.d: "Directed by the leftist director Cai Chusheng, a new film has emerged from Shanghai that is quickly becoming a topic of sensation - \"New Woman\" which deals with the so-called \"new women\" in Chinese society. Based on the story of the leftist actress Ai Xi, the film is described by many as a problem film, while it is lauded by many members within the Kuomintang for its progressive ideals.\n\nThe film centres itself around an educated and modern young woman, Wei Ming (played by the beautiful Ruan Lingyu), who is living in Shanghai during the 1920s. She is a music teacher for a girls' school, although she holds deep aspirations to become a writer. Her neighbour Aying is a factory worker, and Wei Ming teaches the factory workers patriotic songs - raising their spirits to a dream of liberation. Dr. Wang (played by Wang Naidong) is the principal of Wei Ming's school who is infatuated with the young woman, and wants her to be his concubine. Nonetheless, she turns away from him - instead, she chases the disinterested Yu Haichou, an editor. Angered, Dr. Wang fires Wei Ming just as Wei Ming's illegitimate daughter and sister arrive in Shanghai begging for money.\n\nWei Ming's daughter is sick with pneumonia but the sisters cannot pay the hospital fee. Without income as a teacher, Wei Ming attempts to request advance payment for her novel \"Tomb of Love\" but the publisher refuses. Distraught and without options, she prostitutes herself and unexpectedly her first client is Dr. Wang. After being mocked by the principal, she hits him and then runs away just to watch her daughter to die. Having given up hope, Wei Ming overdoses on pills - as she dies in her friends' arms, she cries out \"I want to live, I want revenge!\" The film ends solemnly with Aying and the factory workers walking out of the factory."

This tendency has drawn varying degrees of concern, scorn and imitation from party members as the so-called \"Residence Faction\" takes shape. But not all of his kinsmen will be joining him in the Presidential Palace.\n\nWang Zhaoyong has recently passed away in Macau at age 78. The older half-brother of Wang Jingwei, he was an accomplished poet, scholar and Daoist, taking inspiration from his various travels around the country before Xinhai Revolution. When the revolution broke out, he visited Luofu Mountain and lived for a period in Sumao temple before going into seclusion in Macau.\n\nDespite attempts by both Wang and other Kuomintang members to recruit him, he has repeatedly refused their invitations - claiming his loyalty lies with the Qing monarchy. He claimed to harbour a continuing respect for Emperor Puyi, even as his children sought work in their uncle's government. Throughout the early warlord era, he and other scholars claimed to be the legacy of the old empire, writing nostalgic and traditionalist works. He was rewarded with recognition by the restored Emperor, something he cherished by renaming his home \"Blessing Hall\".\n\nThe elder Wang had elected to remain in Macau even as the Kuomintang sweep across the nation, tending to his own works and refraining on making any major comments on politics. His funeral is expected to attract considerable visitors given his status as an accomplished elder-scholar on his own right, though it is not clear whether or not his relatives will be in attendance."

His allies in the Reorganised Comrades Association have used this to shore up his position against his enemies, propelling a narrative that he is the new Sun Yat-sen - one of the few men able to keep a united front of republicans together in face of the harsh winds of reactionarism.\n\nThe reality on the ground is more mundane. [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] and his government in [FROM.FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] are hardly rushing to implement Kuomintang party-state rule or bend their own held beliefs to the party's socialist interpretation of the Three Principles. Odds are, they are playing a wait-and-see game, calculating [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s apparent strength makes them the most advantageous ally of the moment."
CHI.midgame.851.d.other: "The capitulation of [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] to the Kuomintang revolutionary fold was a pleasant, if not necessarily unexpected surprise to [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. The reactionary warlords that make up the [FROM.FROM.GetRulingParty] tended to be a pragmatic sort, and this latest change in uniform is probably only natural - switching from one master to a newer, redder one. This wise decision to accept the Kuomintang ultimatum has probably saved thousands of lives, at least for now, though that fact (widely publicised by the party's propaganda machine) could hardly wash the taste of disgust from the mouthes of party hardliners.\n\nIndeed, underneath the pomp and ceremony of the recent \"changing of the flags\" in [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef], the political reality will likely remain largely unchanged in [FROM.FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Life will go on, probably under a hiearchy of local reactionary autocrats, who may at best adopt Kuomintang regalia as a fashion statement and play lipservice to the ideals they represent, but otherwise will disgrace our party's message.\n\nWang Jingwei and other authorities that brokered this agreement promise that they will provide adequate oversight into [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] affairs and ultimately [FROM.FROM.GetName]'s \"unorthodoxy\" will be rendered moot upon national unification. But even if they race to integrate their new-found conquest, it remains to be seen whether or not the sacrifices of the people living there will be worth it."

CHI.midgame.852.t: "The Hardliner Fury"
CHI.midgame.852.d: "With the Kuomintang ultimatum having come and gone, the looming war with [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef] has led to a surge in nationalist wrath against [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] and his [FROM.FROM.GetRulingParty]. Rage echoes across the halls of power in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], as radicals have seized the moment to clamour for revenge against the reactionaries - not only for their historic crimes against the Kuomintang but for their on-going oppression of the people.\n\nThis has had the side effect of weakening the position of the establishment, however. Muted, but still present questions about why [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] does not sufficiently fear the party-state and why harsher measures have not already been taken against them have entered the common political discourse. Odds are, as battlefield successes trickle in, these voices will fade into the background, but that is not to say they will ever go away."

CHI.midgame.853.d: "It seems we are not the only Kuomintang faction to have returned to China. In [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], rightist \"Kuomintang\" delegates have gathered under the auspicies of [FROM.GetLeader] to form a rival central committee. They have explicitly denounced us as socialist traitors, claiming we serve the interests of Paris before the Chinese people.\n\nThe Kuomintang once again is divided into left and right, in an embarrassing repeat of the old pre-Northern Expedition divisions. Already, they have begun to peel off many of the centre-right members of our government, with a steady trickle of defections to their camp. Sun Fo thankfully has remained with us for now, though he claims to be working to forment a compromise between our governments."

#Outsider Negotiation Events
CHI.midgame.901.t: "A Republican Pact?"
CHI.midgame.901.d: "The Kuomintang and the Federalists have common roots in Guangzhou, with many early members having participated in the Constitutional Protection War against the tyranny of the would-be Emperor Yuan Shikai. This alliance between Sun Yat-sen and Chen Jiongming soon came to blows over Sun's increasing authoritarianism and Chen's willingness to negotiate with the Beiyang government after Yuan's death. The ensuing coup has left a lasting enmity between the two factions which persists to this day.\n\nWith the return of the Kuomintang in China's eastern five provinces, it seems that they are once more a contender in Chinese national politics and a rival to our own ambitions. Their eyes however are fixated northwards, hoping to resume their northern expedition and topple the Beiyang warlords located there. Using some back-channels and his various contacts within the Federalist movement, Chairman Wang Jingwei has sent emissaries hoping to broker a non-aggression treaty between our respective governments to combat the greater threat posed by our northern rivals.\n\nGiven the wide ideological distance between our respective camps and the bitter history between us, it is unlikely that such a pact can hold for long. There are certainly plenty within the Kuomintang who are bound to be opposed to any agreement with us. But stranger things have happened before in Chinese history, and the warlord era is no ordinary time."
CHI.midgame.901.a: "The corrupt Beiyang warlords must fall! We accept."
CHI.midgame.901.b: "The Kuomintang are little better than red tyrants."

CHI.midgame.902.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Our Pact!"
CHI.midgame.902.d: "After some secret negotiations between representatives of [FROM.GetLeader] and Wang Jingwei, the Chairman has finally received the telegram he has so anxiously been waiting for: the Federalists have accepted our proposal for a non-aggression pact. This frees up our hand when it comes to China's southern region and will allow us to better focus on our ambitions to restart the Northern Expedition.\n\nWang Jingwei has summoned the Central Executive Committee with the proposal, presenting it suddenly and ambushing the Provisional Action Committee. Wang knows well enough what their responses will be - their vision coloured by their scalding hatred of Chen Jiongming and his followers. After all, everyone knows how the treacherous Chen betrayed Dr. Sun in vain hopes of an accord with the Beiyang warlords and later happily worked as a Zhili stooge after the first Northern Expedition collapsed. Song Qingling in particular is said to blame Federalist shelling during Chen's coup for causing her to miscarriage.\n\nWhatever the case, forcing through the agreement before the Central Executive Committee was a must if Wang was to ensure its passage - plenty of RCA members were also sceptical of the agreement. The only others who seemed willing to look past the bad blood for a temporary arrangement are the Reconstruction Faction, who were integral for gaining the slim majority needed for passage. Wang seems to have lost a considerable amount of support thanks to this affair, but if it ensures the Second Northern Expedition is far more successful than the first, perhaps it is a necessary evil."
CHI.midgame.902.a: "A distasteful arrangement, but a necessary one."

CHI.midgame.903.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Our Pact!"
CHI.midgame.903.d: "After days of secret negotiations between representatives of [FROM.GetLeader] and Wang Jingwei, the Chairman has finally received the telegram he had been dreading: the Federalists will not agree to our proposal for a non-aggression pact. Whether out of lingering bad blood from the end of the old Constitutional Protection Movement, continuing ideological rivalry, competing ambitions or simply a lack of trust between both sides, there will be no deal between China's two major southern republican movements.\n\nWang has done his best to keep the talks a secret, and tried to bury the fact that any negotiations took place, but to no avail. It seems that there were enough spies within the Presidential palace that a broad outline of transpired found their ways into the hands of various radical newsources, who have naturally spun an unfavourable narrative for the Chairman.\n\nWang's public relations team have been working overtime to try and dispel the rumours, though the fact that he was willing to negotiate with Sun's old enemies has made him seem weak and unscrupulous. The fact that they failed were of little saving consequence either: his reputation as a negotiator is in tatters. Revolutionary sentiment it seems has hardened in southern China only one vision for the future of the nation will emerge in the end."
CHI.midgame.903.a: "What more can one expect from warlords and traitors?"

CHI.midgame.911.t: "A Kuomintang Pact?"
CHI.midgame.911.d: "The original Kuomintang was founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen as a successor to the broad-tent Tongmenghui, the success of which was marred by its corruption by Yuan Shikai and his clique of Beiyang warlords. The ambiguity of the late founder of the party's Three Principles and his shift leftwards from his initial liberal, nationalistic base was one of the primary (albeit politely ignored) root of the Kuomintang's later schism following his deeath.\n\nHaving consolidated tremendous power around himself and his cult of personality, Sun's influence within the burgeoning Guangzhou revolutionary government was only exceeded by the disparateness of the coalition he had rallied around himself. In the power-struggle that broke out in wake of his death, the left, right, centre, and military factions competed for power - much to the detriment of the revolution as a whole. The final blow to any chance at party unity came with the failure of the Northern Expedition. The Kuomintang splinters scattered to the winds, and most figured they were better off alone.\n\nIt seems fate has brought us back together again, with now competing rival Kuomintang governments in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. The ideological divide between the two Kuomintang central committees are too great to bridge, however many former Whampoa classmates and military comrades between our camps have sought to broker at least a temporary non-aggression pact as we prepare to fight the far greater threat of Beiyang warlords to the north. After all, given that the National Revolutionary Army failed to bring down Beiyang in 1927 as a united force, it is doubtful we can do it alone now."
CHI.midgame.911.a: "We must unite for the sake of party and the nation!"
CHI.midgame.911.b: "[FROM.GetLeader] is nothing more than an French bootlicker."

CHI.midgame.912.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Our Pact!"
CHI.midgame.912.d: "After days of hushed negotiations between various intermediaries of the [FROM.GetRulingParty] and the NRA high command, a general truce has been agreed upon between our rival Kuomintang governments for an indefinite period. This agreement, signed by [FROM.GetLeader] and Deng Yanda will allow both sides to free up forces for a future continuation of the Northern Expedition, allowing the Kuomintang to put Beiyang in its grave once and for all.\n\nThis agreement with the rightists in our party, which have devolved into warlordism and ideological heresy, has deeply unsettled many. Hardliners and even more moderate socialists have denounced this agreement as perverse, and condemned the mechanism in which it was brought about. Although Wang Jingwei and the Central Executive Committee have given their tacit approval for this deal, the RCA have made it known their displeasure at the military's overreach - accusing them of putting their Whampoa days camaraderie in front of the needs of the the people.\n\nIn any case, there has been a palatable shift in favour of the Chairman and the party orthodoxy as the backlash rises. The PAC and RF have been notably silent on the matter, trying to distance themselves from the actions of their aligned commanders. But if this is what it takes to liberate China, then what must be done must be done."
CHI.midgame.912.a: "We must secure our flank, no matter the cost."

CHI.midgame.913.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Our Pact!"
CHI.midgame.913.d: "After days of hushed negotiations between various intermediaries of the [FROM.GetRulingParty] and the NRA high command, a hoped-for truce between the rival Kuomintang governments has not been forthcoming. For all the talk of camaraderie and shared fond memories of Whampoa/the old National Revolutionary Army, the distrust between the two camps was too great to overcome. It seems that there will be no peace between the warring central committees, and both have embraced the reality that there will be no reconcilation.\n\nThe breakdown of these talks was to be expected but nonetheless the backlash has been fierce. The dishonesty of the [FROM.GetAdjective] leadership and the willingness of so many in the National Revolutionary Army and Kuomintang establishment to tolerate talks with them has disillusioned many avowed socialists. The Kuomintang is willing to talk tough, railing against warlords and reactionaries, but are willing to accommodate them as they see fit.\n\nMany now see the Kuomintang as too insular to detach themselves from their personal interests and connections to traitors. They turn to alternatives, particularly the radicals in the Chinese Syndicalist Party, hoping for a future generally free from the corruption of the warlord era."
CHI.midgame.913.a: "What more can one expect from warlords and heretics?"

### Section 3a (000-199): Political Content

CHI.lategame.000.t: "The Completion of the Northern Expedition"
CHI.lategame.000.d: "About a decade ago, Chiang Kai-shek addressed his officers on the eve of the Northern Expedition:\n\n\"The importance of this fight is not only in that it will decide the fate of the warlords. But, whether or not the Chinese nation and race can restore their freedom and independence hangs in the balance. In other words, it is a struggle between the nation and the warlords, between the revolution and the counter-revolutionaries, between the Three People's Principles and imperialism.\"\n\nThe Kuomintang was knocked down then, but the fight never ended. Today, the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth finally was raised over a changed Beijing as party members (both those that witnessed the first expedition and those that joined in the interim) cheered on. As [CHI.GetLeader] and other party members delivered their speeches, soldiers paraded, and experts speculated about the future there was little doubt of the significance of the moment: victory.\n\nYes, victory. Victory over the warlords. Victory over the counter-revolutionaries. Victory over imperialism. Chiang and many others did not live to see the moment but their legacy is secured. The Kuomintang has proven themselves capable of more than just words, casting down the institutions they so hated.\n\nEven if resistance continues and enemy pockets are mopped up, the nation is changing. Socialism appears more and more as a credible future for China and the Kuomintang no longer merely a fringe party. But threats remain. Heavy is the head that wears the crown, and the party's newfound legitimacy has drawn the attention of a host of foes both at home and abroad. Meanwhile it fights to avoid being undone by the influx of opportunists, divisions, and new responsibilities. The people now expect them to lead, and that's often far more difficult than to overthrow."
CHI.lategame.000.a: "We have a lot of work ahead of us."

#Second Congress Event Chain
CHI.lategame.001.t: "The Second Repatriated Congress of the Kuomintang is Convened"
CHI.lategame.001.d: "As the flag of the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholly Red Earth now flies above the Tiananmen Gate above a recently installed portrait of the late eternal premier Dr. Sun Yat-sen, calls have gone out throughout the country to convene a special emergency session of the National Congress. While traditionally orthodox party doctrine has called for these meetings every four years, the developments of the national Revolution have instead suspended this procedure in favour of calling sessions when needed.\n\nChairman [CHI.GetLeader] once again has been given the honour of opening the Congress to commemorate the success of the Northern Expedition, but observers of the Congress remark that the mood within the delegates is considerably more tense than the first Congress. There are certainly rumours in the dark of knives being sharpened, especially amongst those who oppose Chairman Wang's gravitation towards authoritarianism. While the [CHI.GetNameDef] now controls the former imperial capital of Beijing, strengthening its legitimacy as a national unifier; there is still much work to do to win the people's hearts and minds and drive the Japanese imperialists out of China once and forever.\n\nThe Congress has also seen greater participation of revolutionary women within the ranks of the Kuomintang. Most notable are those such as Deng Yingchao, Zeng Xing, Cai Chang, and Xiang Jingyu (who all hold long ties with the Chinese socialist movement) but also newcomers such as the wife of the Uygur politician Burhan Shadidi and the deputy director of Xinjiang Women's Federation - Rashida. Furthermore, in attendance are members of the Internationale Military Mission in China, yet another reminder of the Internationale's staunch support for the success of the socialist Chinese Revolution. And without further ado, Wang's concluding remarks on the importance of unity drew only polite applause as the Congress delegates began to take the floor."
CHI.lategame.001.a: "Well get on with it!"

CHI.lategame.002.t: "Grand Ambitions for a New Republic"
CHI.lategame.002.d: "First on the Congress' agenda was to implement the Party state's mass bureaucracy into a greater national form. The Kuomintang is to be not only a political organ for the next pivotal years of political tutelage but also a guiding force to train and teach the masses revolutionary consciousness so that the Chinese people themselves could finally stand up to imperialism. As such, a near unanimous vote has approved proposals to establish a formal Ministry of Education and a National Health Administration.\n\nThe Ministry of Education is to be led by one of the Four Elders of the Kuomintang and a member of the World Society, Cai Yuanpei. Cai, who commands a great amount of prestige due to his work in the reform of Beijing University nearly a decade earlier, is himself a philosophical anarchist and advocates combining labour and learning in education. Basic to the conception of a new revolutionary education is the recruitment of students and labourers into the education system - thus ending the monopolisation of education by the wealthy. Along with the planned construction of the Academia Sinica, there will also be an Industrial Labour College, an Agricultural Labour College, and a Social Sciences College (the third choice reflecting the anarchist ideals that the social sciences and social revolution were inseparable).\n\nRural health conditions in the Chinese countryside are utterly deplorable by modern medicine standards, in some cases, midwives resort to using cow dung or mud to stop the bleeding during delivery. The promotion of public health is seen not only as an extension of Minsheng (the people's welfare) but also reflects Dr. Sun's belief that a physically strong people could not be so easily conquered. As a result, a National Health Administration has been founded by the Ministry of the Interior; its goals are to create mobile clinics, and public health stations, enforce vaccinations, and train local midwives/nurses in modern medicine techniques. With pressure from the PAC, the Administration's first experimental health clinics will be established in the former MinGan Zone."
CHI.lategame.002.a: "We turn dreams into reality."

CHI.lategame.003.t: "The Language Issue"
CHI.lategame.003.d: "As the Congress drags on, one of the main questions to answer is that of language. Nearly 300 million native speakers of its northern dialect of Mandarin in China. In the South, there are 37 million who speak Wu (the dialect of Zhejiang), 22 million speak Cantonese, 20 million speak Hakka, and several million speak the Fujian dialect. During the wars of unification, there were undoubtedly incidents in which language unfamiliarity led to chaos within the armed forces and across the country.\n\nWhile the Northern Chinese dialect of Mandarin continues to dominate use in the official language of the government, there is an emerging argument between those who insist that mandarin be standardised and used for cultural, official, and educational purposes. There are those who support the cultural protection of China's many languages. Proponents of radical language reform, especially among radical socialists, argue that the character system must be simplified to promote mass literacy across the country. However, they are opposed by more traditionalists within the Kuomintang. They argue that this extensive language simplification will strip characters and words of their original meaning and cultural sophistication.\n\nA compromise is reached, however, with the Ministry of Education first publishing a list of "Guoyin Common Vocabulary". which includes popular simplified characters and determines the standard phonetic system. Furthermore, it has also proposed the creation of a committee on the Unification of National Languages to organise simplified characters already in circulation as standard characters. However, this is far from radical character reform and does not seek to change many existing characters in the Chinese hanzi."
CHI.lategame.003.a: "China must be united, one way or another."

CHI.lategame.004.t: "National Reconstruction"
CHI.lategame.004.d: "Years of economic stagnation and government failure has made the Chinese economy an utter laughingstock in the eyes of the modernised and industrialised West. If China is to reassert her historical position as the leading power in Asia, then like Japan before her - she must take it upon herself to rapidly industrialise and modernise.\n\nLeading the discourse on National Reconstruction are none other than Central Committee members Chen Gongbo and Song Ziwen. Both Song and Chen see China as an economically colonised country, forced to let the foreign powers extract her raw materials and invade its market -  thus hindering China's own industrial development. Chen and Song are influenced by international developments in the Commune of France, the Union of Britain, and interestingly enough even the Russian NRPR movement, to conceptualise a concept of autarkic industrialisation, or the reorientation of the economy along lines of dirigisme and corporatism.\n\nThey plan for the development of a National Economic Council which shall seek to utilise central economic planning, development through centrally managed production teams, the mobilisation of agriculture in support of urban industrialisation, and a corporatist relationship between governments and private businesses (allocated by the state of course). By nationalising and monopolising foreign trade, Chen Gongbo has argued that the state would gain additional means to build capital. The ultimate goal of this state-capitalist model is to develop the Chinese economy while also preventing the new Chinese republic from sliding into bourgeois capitalism. Certainly, there may be some capitalists who would grow rich in the process of harnessing private capital but according to Chen Gongbo, they would not develop sufficient strength to subvert the economic system of the Party-State."
CHI.lategame.004.a: "A new direction is needed to combat capitalism."

CHI.lategame.005.t: "The National Anthem"
CHI.lategame.005.d: "With the unification of China proper under the sword and flag of the Kuomintang, efforts have been made to consolidate Nationalist rule with a proper Chinese anthem. The previous anthem of the Beiyang Republic \"Song to the Auspicious Cloud\" and other anthems have been denounced as being backwards and or irrelevant to the modern Chinese revolutionary struggle. Furthermore, the National Anthem Commission has been assigned to create a patriotic song to rally the millions of people that make up the Chinese nation - in order to bolster nationalism as part of the party's pursuit of \"Minzu\".\n\nWhile some radical socialists within the KMT and the League of Chinese Syndicalists have proposed the Internationale (translated in vernacular Chinese by the syndicalist Qu Qiubai), this move has attracted backlash from members of the Central Committee who believe that the lyrics of the National Anthem must reflect the principles held dear by our late premier Dr. Sun Yat-sen. As such, many are in favour of adopting Professor Cheng Maoyun's "Three Principles of the People" - which traces its lyrics to a speech Sun Yat-sen gave in 1924. Alternatively, a suggestion has arisen from the Chinese musician Huang Tzu - with lyrics taken from a poem written by the prominent right-wing Kuomintang ideologue Dai Jitao. While not as popular as the other two options, the song has also been suggested to be played at the raising and lowering of the national flag."

Nonetheless, warlords still remain either in vague loose alliances with [CHI.GetNameDef] or are outright opposed to the Kuomintang's claims to national leadership."
CHI.lategame.006.concessions: "The Legation Cities and other concessions in China must also be dealt with severely as to the Chinese Nationalist Party, these regions are integral Chinese lands - unlawfully stolen in humiliation by shameful treaties and brutal invasions.

CHI.lategame.007.t: "The Closing of the Congress"
CHI.lategame.007.d: "Chairman [CHI.GetLeader] stepped forward one last time for the conclusion of the Party's second Congress, giving an eloquent speech lauding the martyrs and sacrifices made during the Second Northern Expedition. From the League War to the capture of Beijing, many revolutionary comrades had fallen along the way - and the fight is far from over. As long as imperialism remains in China, China cannot call herself free - the time has come for the KMT to take up its natural destiny as the true revolutionary vanguard to lead the Chinese people into a new era of respect and prestige.\n\nThe conclusion of the Second Congress have nonetheless raised some growing intensifying debates between members of the Provisional Action Committee and the Reorganised Comrades Association. The shaky united front between the Party's major factions as well as the other minor outlying factions of the national revolution is starting to unravel as there is no longer such a dominant call for unity. Growing criticism has been levelled towards Wang, who many in the PAC worry will simply seek to promulgate tutelage or merely hand over power nepotistically to his friends and family. Chen Gongbo has not been unrelenting at all in his insults at Deng Yanda, with Chen likening Deng and his military circles to a Bonapartist, and arguing that the PAC will not bring about democracy but rather years of military rule. All the while, what was once mere hushes has grown significantly in some extremist circles of the NRA - talks of radicalism brewing if the Party's leadership cannot resolve itself.\n\nStill, there is much to be done before the Kuomintang can truly settle down. The National Revolution must continue on and the phase of tutelage cannot end until imperialism is firmly driven out of the country."

#Phase 3 Political Narrative Events (040-059) - fire every 6 months

CHI.lategame.040.t: "Xu Qian Passes Away"
CHI.lategame.040.d: "After the Qing dynasty fell in 1911, there have been many would-be law-bringers who sought to create justice in a reformed China. Few have been as honest or influential as Xu Qian, a founding father of our Republic's judicial system. Born in Nanchang, he successfully passed the imperial examination and went to work for the Ministry of Justice in 1907. He was a member of the Tongmenghui when he became Deputy of Minister of Justice under Tang Shaoyi's cabinet, but resigned in protest in face of Yuan Shikai's power grab. Since then, he held a variety of posts in the Kuomintang, including a seat on the Central Executive Committee.\n\nThe loss of such a prominent Old Guard member is a great tragedy for the party, even if he was lucky to have passed from old age, and have lived long enough to see our liberation of Beijing. And yet, already, the power jockeying has begun. As compensation for his loss of his CEC seat, Wang Jingwei gave him the post of Minister of Justice in the revolutionary government. Xu leaned towards the PAC, and the usual complaints about balance of power have streamed in from the same suspects. Wang has little patience for another round of theatrics, recalling the rumbling after Liao Zhongkai's death.\n\nCai Yuanpei, a former mentor of Wang and one of the esteemed \"Elders\" of the party has stepped up to the plate, offering to take on the position. An educator by training, there is a certain irony of an ex-anarchist becoming Minister of Justice, but perhaps that's part his appeal as a compromise between the RCA, PAC, and LCS.\n\nIn Wang's camp, Luo Junqiang has emerged as a leading candidate, upon the recommendation of Zhou Fohai. Luo is a former radical from the CSP, a former lieutenant colonel under Zhang Zhizhong, and has experience as a newspaper editor.\n\nAlthough in theory the Minister of Justice is nominated by the Premier of the Judicial Yuan, the CEC has met privately to decide on which candidate to \"suggest\" to the Premier."

CHI.lategame.041.t: "The Chen Bijun Incident"
CHI.lategame.041.d: "Chen Bijun or, as many derisively call her, Wang Furen (Madame Wang) is a power unto herself. While Wang dominates the political scene in Nanjing, she has established plenty of bases of her own to shore up her husband's position. As a testament to her power, at one point she is said to have informed a recently appointed mayor that \"The city is mine. You go there but do not control anyone. You just represent me to do things.\" This active lifestyle however has forced her to travel frequently, leaving her vulnerable to opponents.\n\nOr so they thought. With the help of some local (apparently ex-warlord) commanders, her entourage was ambushed at a parade she was supposed to attend. Under heavy guard, the kidnapping attempt was quickly foiled.\n\nThe government has begun its investigation and the finger-pointing has soon followed. Chen has publicly accused the army of orchestrating it, though her opponents have accused her of staging the whole event to gain sympathy and a pretext to arrest her enemies. Despite the clear evidence of wrongdoing, her allies have done damage to her case with their heavy-handed tactics in the immediate aftermath.\n\nWhat is undisputable however is how unsafe China is becoming, even in long \"liberated\" regions under Kuomintang rule. Violence against political figures has been normalised, and not everyone is as fortunate enough to have an armed caravan with them everywhere they go. Zhou Enlai has suggested pulling back, arguing revenge is best served cold. Wang, who has been enraged by the incident against his beloved wife, has turned to Li Shiqun for more proactive advice.\n\nLi, a former Red Squad member and now head of the Wang household security team, has instead suggested a harsher approach to root out subversives. Going house-to-house, he hopes to shake out suspects. Li influence within the Residence Faction is sure to increase after his successful protection of the First Lady."

CHI.lategame.042.t: "Anarchism and the party-state"
CHI.lategame.042.d: "In their ever continuing fight for control over the syndicalist movement in China, the Four Elders have sought to rope in anarchist thinkers and intellectuals into their movement. Former anarchists themselves and the primary patrons of the \"World Society\", they joined the Kuomintang in the 1920s - to the scorn of many \"true believers.\".\n\nWu Zhihui has vocally defended their decision the most. He has argued that the Kuomintang, World Society, and anarchists have a common enemy in warlordism and that like Kropotkin's support for the Great War, it is sometimes necessary for anarchists to support aligned causes. Moreover, with the Kuomintang's return to China, he has argued that the party has meaningfully changed since 1927, now truly committed to revolution and even should it fail - can always be brought back to the right path if enough anarchists join.\n\nNot everyone is convinced. Mao Yibo for example has accused the Kuomintang of being corrupt and serving the interests of militarists and job-seekers. Shen Zhongji, an anarcho-syndicalist from Zhejiang who had worked for the party briefly but has since grown estranged, has reiterated many of the concerns he expressed in 1924 in the \"Free People\" journal.\n\nTo him, the common-enemy argument could be used to justify any alliance and he denounced the idea that anarchists are like \"knight-errants\" of the classics, required to help everyone who asks. Instead, the modern anarchist must abide by their principles and keep in mind what happens next. He has further castigated the Four Elder's support of tutelage, democracy, and dictatorship of the proletariat - all of which retain government and private property. Hoping to follow such a path to anarchism, which has neither, would be \"no different than going south in order to go north\".\n\nStill, Shen and others have had some history of cooperating with the Kuomintang. But as the party has grown increasingly authoritarian, it will require far more than flowery discourse to truly sway hearts."

CHI.lategame.043.t: "Wang Leping Murdered!"
CHI.lategame.043.d: "A grisly murder has been reported in Nanjing today. While many have grown apathetic to the death and violence around them, even among prominent politicians, this one has stirred up considerable emotions. Wang Leping was a long-time socialist revolutionary from Wulian County in Shandong. A prolific writer, progressive, and activist, he often served as a contact point between Wang Jingwei's camp and other socialist factions.\n\nBy 1926, he was the first alternative Central Executive Committee member and also spent time working under Deng Yanda and Feng Yuxiang. Generally well-liked (or at least respected), he turned away from Chen Duxiu and Marxism. Instead he found his home in the Moderate wing of the Reorganised Comrades Association, co-writing the Advance newspaper with Gu Mengyu. Suspects continue to abound as people wonder the motivations of the crime.\n\nThe nature and brutality of crime generally points to Dai Chunfeng and his men, who have a considerable network of contacts in the Jiangnan region since his League of Ten days. The RCA have extended their accusations to the entire army, believing this to be the cumulation of a longer campaign of coercion against RCA-aligned politicians. PAC politicians have fired back, noting that Wang Leping was often on the verge of siding with them, and Zhou Enlai's Red Squad often can match the League in ruthless when it comes to silencing traitors.\n\nIt is unlikely the true culprits will ever be caught, and at best the police will catch a few low-life scapegoats. But as suspicions rise, it seems that one narrative will generally prevail, even if not everyone believes it."

CHI.lategame.044.d: "\"Religion teaches men obedience, which is the moral code of slaves! Religion propagates superstitions which hinder the search for truth.\"\n\nThese are proclamations often found in Beijing, placed by a resurgent Great Federation of Anti-Religionists. The federation is a movement by many Chinese intellectuals, both directly part of the Kuomintang and outside of it. Anticlericalism in China often has multiple roots, the Christian church in particular is opposed by the intelligentsia for its perceived backwardness as well as its association with foreign imperialism. This mutual disdain has attracted socialist, anarchist, and nationalists together in this campaign, protesting for example the World's Student Christian Federation Conference scheduled to be held at Tsinghua University. At the movement's helm once included many luminaries such as Li Shizeng, Chen Duxiu, Cai Yuanpei, Li Dazhao and Wang Jingwei.\n\nNot everyone in the party has an antagonistic relationship with religion or even Christianity for that matter. The Song family patriarch Song Jiashu was a Methodist minister and raised all of his children in the faith. Dr. Sun Yat-sen and Sun Fo converted to the faith as well. Many others find themselves in more complicated situations, living between their Confucian-inspired upbringing and exposure to Christian preaching. Zhang Fakui and his wife for example have loosely affiliated with Roman Catholicism though have not converted.\n\nCautious in being embroiled in these touchy matters, both Wang Jingwei and Song Qingling have largely refrained from making any statement in public despite their respective pasts - offering only generic statements asking for peace and mutual respect. But often-times as the revolution's claims of social change hit a delicate nerve as China continues to change."

CHI.lategame.045.t: "A Declaration..."
CHI.lategame.045.d: "As the revolution drags on, the party faces a conundrum. The movement which, for all its divisions, was once concentrated while down on its last legs, has now grown to a critical point. As the [CHI.GetName] swallowed up much of China, more and more non-socialists have been absorbed to the ostensibly democratic party. Meanwhile, sensing victory and not wishing to water down the promises they have sacrificed so much for, plenty on the left have grown radicalised. Soon, many fear, the party will once again be back at one another's throats like in 1924.\n\nThis problem has taken shape in the clashing working papers being passed around the Legislative Yuan. The first has proposed that the central problem of China lies in the poverty of the peasantry, and that they are poor because of their lack of land. Therefore, it calls upon the newly established Ministry of Agriculture and Labour to implement the long-awaited land reform. Furthermore, the Kuomintang's ranks must also be drawn by the growing number of proletariat in the nation's industrialising cities. The party must therefore support unionisation and breaking both foreign and domestic chains. Fittingly, the draft has dedicated itself to the union of \"Peasants and Workers\".\n\nAnother, less popular draft, seeks to address the growing fears of division in the party-state. If the party represents the nation, then it cannot afford to fall back into a state of quasi-civil war like in at Canton. The paper calls for reconciliation, both with former Kuomintang rightists and with other democratic revolutionaries to build a new, representative China. While it also includes mentions of fulfilling social and economic promises, it also has called for moderation and the forgiveness of past transgressions.\n\nAt the end of the day, the drafts being showcased are just words from a relatively powerless legislature. But, with free expression often suppressed (whether de jure or de facto), often these halls are among the few places where free discussion is permitted. The Declaration that ultimately passes will demonstrate the strength of various caucuses."

CHI.lategame.046.t: "Formation of the League of Civil Rights"
CHI.lategame.046.d: "The Kuomintang revolution has sparked discourse on a freer China, but not always favourably; many intellectuals have noticed the dissonance between Kuomintang promises and the party-state's reality. Like flashes in the pan, most efforts to speak out have come to little Except perhaps one.\n\nInitially proposed by left-leaning foreign journalists living in Shanghai, the China League of Civil Rights was formed in 1932 as a means of gathering liberal support for the Shanghai uprising. This \"new line of action\" included creating a striking contrast between Zhili oppression and Kuomintang liberation.\n\nTheir manifesto included three tenants: to liberate political prisoners, to give legal assistance to political prisoners, and to assist in the struggle for civil rights including free organisation, speech, press and assembly. They have sought the attention of both liberals internationally and from the Beiyang establishment, though were not successful at freeing any prisoners.\n\nWang was unamused when Song Qingling, Cai Yuanpei, and Yang Xingfo submitted a very public telegram last month on behalf of the League to the CEC. The letter demanded the end of arbitrary arrests and was signed by dozens of prominent figures in the party, academia, and the press. Peril abounds and there is doubts on its longevity. Already Song and Cai have been sternly warned for stepping outside the party orthodoxy, and anonymous death threats have come in (though their high rank protects them from any real harm). Others however, not so much. Yang was gunned down in front of the Academia Sinica building yesterday afternoon, sending a chill through the League.\n\nThe League has also staggered due to infighting. New Culture figures like Hu Shih and Liu Yutang had been reluctant to sign on unless the League commits to only using legal channels. Prior rivalries within the LCS has made the CSP hesitant to join the World Society in endorsing the league. Many of the original members have gone to extremes, undermining Song and Cai's authority. Ultimately rather elitist organisation, it has also struggled to gain much popular support."

CHI.lategame.047.t: "Charity and Cunning in China"
CHI.lategame.047.d: "If there's any silver lining to the mayhem and tragedy of war, it is when communities and nations grow closer together in solidarity. With so many lives uprooted thanks to war and revolution, often-times government initiatives are simply not enough to help the suffering. With the magistrates overwhelmed, there is often room for humble heroes to lend a helping hand.\n\nSong Qingling, the widow of Sun Yat-sen, has entered the national spotlight with her numerous charitable efforts. As President of the China Welfare Foundation (founded initially as the China Defence League), they have raised money from foreign aid and private donations to support a wide range of causes including refugee relief, medical supplies, and care for orphans. Led primary by the Song and Liao families, they owe their prominence in part due to their connections with the Central Executive Committee and also favourable press coverage by figures such as Edgar Snow.\n\nUnfortunately, although few would like to publicly admit it, charity is often also another weapon of war. The party has exploited in the past its concern for the poor as a propaganda tool against warlord governments. Even organisations ostensibly neutral often have party members strategically placed on their boards, including the Red Cross Society of China.\n\nPartisans affiliated with the Provisional Action Committee have taken the opportunity to cast Song (and to a lesser extent He Xiangning) as a marked contrast with First Lady Chen Bijun, as perhaps the two most prominent women in the nation. While both came from wealthy merchant families and are long-time revolutionaries, Chen has been depicted by PAC-aligned papers as a scheming and machiavellian shrew - obsessed more with power than helping the people. Wang has angerily demanded censors quickly remove such publications and Song has disavowed any such disunity, but the smear campaign is likely to create a lasting enmity between the factions."
CHI.lategame.047.a: "Song's efforts are lauded nation-wide."

CHI.lategame.048.t: "The Shifting Underground"
CHI.lategame.048.d: "\"Laws are useless when men are pure, unenforceable when men are corrupt.\"\n\nThe Kuomintang's involvement with the underground is a complex affair - but certainly not a static one. While nationalist gangs were a major help across the decades, providing republican causes both shelter and funding during their most dire times, they have also been a parasitic influence as the party rises again. Now that the party has successfully united the nation, their former allies have come forward to \"collect.\"\n\nIt is not always a simple thing to differentiate criminal gangs from revolutionary cells. They often share tactics such as extortion, secret-gathering, and violence during revolutionary times. Many mobsters are sincere in their republican outlook and have already been rewarded with local positions of power, posts that give them an air of legitimacy in their dealings. They burrow themselves into pillars of society, adapting to the post-revolutionary atmosphere. But the corruption, wheeling-and-dealing, and nepotism has undoubtedly have had a corrosive effect - sullying our image as a force for a more egalitarian future.\n\nOf course, there are some that are straight-up criminals or opportunists. Those have been the primary target of recent anti-crime initiatives. But there is a call now to curb misconduct, expelling these unsavoury elements with a broad brush. As our government expands and revolutionary enthusiasm has waned in favour of finding stability, many fear that the party-state's resistance to outside criticism leaves it vulnerable to institutionalised corruption and abuse. Defining the difference between a well-connected local power-holder and a nefarious mobster in a clean suit may very well make the difference in our nation's future."

CHI.lategame.049.t: "The Cult of the Chairman"
CHI.lategame.049.d: "Throughout history, particularly in times of great strife, people have often clung to the mythos of a strong-man: a powerful, visionary leader capable of protecting the common person and saving the nation. And in the new China being born, that leader might just be Wang Jingwei. Handsome, charismatic, and well-educated - Wang is a natural leader. He has been a revolutionary since before even Xinhai, risking his life in a daring assassination attempt against the Qing regent. A popular myth is that he was saved from execution because he caught the eye of a Manchu noblewoman.\n\nWang, as the party-machine cries, was the man who has led the party through thick and thin. Through the ignominious exile and then sweeping into national leadership. Wang is the heroic democrat who will fulfil the democratic promises of the Xinhai Revolution. Wang is the statesman capable of uniting the party's warring factions, healing rifts within the Kuomintang and also building bridges with the outside world. Wang is the revolutionary with the vision, the man who can truly build an egalitarian, free, and prosperous China. Wang is the man, the leader who will unite China, cast out imperialists and warlords, and end the humiliations.\n\nWang himself has sought to maintain a humble image in public. A portrait of Sun Yat-sen was hung over Tiananmen gate, looking over the square. Wang was sure to be there for the dedication speech, delivering an emotional address honouring the party's Eternal Premier. Sun Fo however has lashed back in whatever publications he could find willing to defy the Chairman's authority. Hoping to stop or at least stall Wang's efforts to incorporate himself into the broader Sun Yat-sen personality cult and mythos, he has written a series of publications leveraging his claimed status as the expert on his father's work. He argues that the late party founder's legacy was not Marxist and has been sure to include multiple snide remarks about Wang. His damning words were calculated to just barely skirt the line of the censors, and has already started a political firestorm."

CHI.lategame.050.t: "Liu Shaoqi in Fujian"
CHI.lategame.050.d: "Born to a prosperous Hunan family with ties to Jiangxi, Liu Shaoqi was fortunate enough to go abroad for his studies. Recruited by some predecesssors to the Chinese Syndicalist Party in 1920, his eyes were opened by his experiences in post-revolutionary France. He formally joined the newly formed CSP in 1921 and returned home in 1922 to help organise various labour strikes in the Jiangxi-Hunan area. He also met Li Lisan, becoming an increasing prominent member of the CSP and by extension the League of Chinese Syndicalists.\n\nThe Northern Expedition was a difficult time for both the Kuomintang and the League. Forced underground, he served as a minor political officer in the MinGan insurgency. Although considered an Orthodox member of the CSP, generally supporting the Chen Duxiu-Li Lisan Line, the connections he made in MinGan might prove pivotal in the LCS's attempts at expanding their movement beyond their urban proletariat base.\n\nLiu has been appointed the CSP Party Secretary of Fujian, hoping to win friends in the heart of the National Revolutionary Government's agrarian movement. A strong writer, he has published a series of articles, including one that extols the mass movement, arguing the revolution should strive for freedom of the masses, winning their great faith, and adopting completely democratic working methods and organisational methods. He has called for both party cadres and leaders to be disciplined and democratic, public in their organising as to ensure a democratic form of leadership. Moreover, he has also called for the implementation of land reform.\n\nMany are unimpressed, believing that these are just words. But the sincerity of his outreach has moved at least some, particularly those who feel the current PAC-dominated leadership in the region has grown too stagnant. The successes of the CSP in building greater rural ties perhaps is just as much a factor of how complacent the PAC has grown, and already cadres have expressed concern of brewing tensions."

#Phase 3 Assorted Political Events (060-079)

CHI.lategame.061.t: "Expanding the United Front?"
CHI.lategame.061.d: "It wasn't always like this. Years ago, when the Tongmenghui first took power at the end of the Xinhai Revolution, there was hope for a multi-plural democratic republic. But even as they entered Beijing for negotiations, sinister machinations were already in play and the dream of a peaceful handover of power was dashed.\n\nIn its wake, the Kuomintang was formed by an aggrieved Dr. Sun. The party has made its share of alliances with warlords and republicans, notably the Constitutional Protection Movement, but ultimately it came to nought and Dr. Sun realised we were better off alone. The Chinese United Front with the League of Chinese Socialists was the sole exception to this, and the decision to reach out to Syndicalist powers splintered the party into factions - yet another painful memory for the weary movement. Yet in the end, it was this alliance that now stands triumphant in Beijing.\n\nThe question today is what to do with the others: the dozens of other factions who collaborated with the corrupt Beiyang system. Many centrist factions have reached out in hopes of having a place in our new government. These politicians have a variety of motivations, some due to patriotism, some due to aligned goals, and others due to naked opportunism.\n\nAlthough the Kuomintang professes the need for a one-party state during the tutelage, this does not need to be so literally interpreted as the LCS can attest. Alternatives include allowing individual politicians to run as Dangwai (literally \"Outside of Party\" or \"Party Outsider\"). For this scheme to work, a reasonable number of seats must be set aside for these independents, though obviously not enough to challenge Kuomintang rule. Another option is to simply absorb certain elements into the party directly, after all there are plenty of people who once swore allegiance to the broad-tent Tongmenghui.\n\nBe warned however, not everyone will be happy if we debase our party, even if it advances our ultimate goal of democracy. But it will send a message across the land that we not a gaggle of socialist radicals, but a reasonable movement worthy of Dr. Sun's legacy."
CHI.lategame.061.a: "Allow them to run as Dangwai in elections."

CHI.lategame.061.c: "We have no use for them during tutelage."

CHI.lategame.062.t: "Federalist Principles in the movement?"
CHI.lategame.062.d: "Federalism, in its current state, has been largely discredited within Kuomintang circles. This was because of its affiliation with Chen Jiongming, a Guangdong general who broke with Dr. Sun in 1922 after a bitter series of mutual escalations. Many members of the party felt personally attacked (in many cases, quite literally) by this betrayal, and the ensuing bad blood has poisoned ties between southern republican groups.\n\nBut federalism as a concept has its predecessors in the party. Li Shizeng for example argued that federalism a continuation of Proudhonist \"Principle of Federation\", a necessary step in the eventual implementation of anarchism in China. To him and others in the World Society, a proper form of federalism would require sharing between central and local units. This cooperation would exist between villages, districts, provinces, regional councils and up to the central government, something he referred to as \"fengzhi hezuo\" and identified with French concepts of regionalisme and federalisme. Eventually, the hope is that a world-wide federation would be established and power devolved slowly downwards until the state is abolished.\n\nThis line of thinking has been criticised not only by the Marxist-inspired factions in the party, but also many of the nationalist factions. In a notable turnabout in the early 1920s, the term \"self-government\" was phased out of Kuomintang propaganda in favour of \"local administration\". To the Kuomintang, self-government became less associated with democracy and more associated with a continuation of warlordism - a fact not helped by Chen Jiongming's decision to accept Wu Peifu's rule.\n\nNonetheless, throwing a bone out there for the Federalist remnants in the country would help smoothen unification. But these short term compromises can only hold together for so long. But could they possibly be long enough?"

CHI.lategame.063.d: "One of the touchiest subjects of the day in [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], yet perhaps the most ubiquitous compromise within the party-state is the rehabilitation of many \"rightists\" in the party. Or at least claiming to be members of the party. The practical distinction between the old Kuomintang's left, right, centre, and military factions were always much more blurred than at the top. While figures such as Wang Jingwei, Liao Zhongkai, Hu Hanmin, Sun Fo, Dai Jitao, and Chiang Kai-shek quarrelled over the Sun Yat-sen's legacy, for most rank-and-file members the party represented one unified revolutionary movement.\n\n\"Leftists\" and \"rightists\" often went to class together at Whampoa, fought side by side in the trenches, and often were killed together by reactionaries. It is no surprise that even after all these years and the acrimony growing quite bitter, including mutual slander, assassinations, and even outright warfare, plenty of lower ranking officers have helped their old friends find a place in our new government.\n\nFor the better informed members of the party that sit in the CEC, the reality is drastically different. Most \"right\" Kuomintang factions are warlords by this point, a facsimile of revolutionary spirit at best and a mockery of our efforts at worst. The CEC looks down on reconciliation, viewing them as too far gone. Allowing these party-apostates into our ranks is a recipe for treason, deception, or worse corruption - and this sort of subversion is dangerous in these times.\n\nIt is very difficult to actually legislate any official ban or even regulate it. And going against the grain is always hard. But even a few words by leading CEC members can markedly change the mood of the party as a whole."

Like an addict who fell from grace, China was brought low by the mass addiction pressed onto it by unscrupulous foreign capitalists and their imperialist backers. Now, if the Kuomintang is to save their nation's soul, they must heal the corruption at its source.\n\nWith many warlords, officials, and unfortunately even socialists like us profiting off the trade, cracking down on it has been a tall order. It is a ready source of profit, despite the human costs involved, and plenty of other narcotics have flown into the nation in the meanwhile. Bureaus, agencies and non-governmental reformers have all tried with no avail, though with our recent consolidation of control there is hope for genuine change this time.\n\nTo stop it, a series of wide-reaching proposals have been presented by various legal, medical, and social experts. These include various rehabilitation policies, harsh arrests and punishments of dealers, and aggressive targetting of opium-producing regions for destruction/replanting. On the flip-side however, it is possible that a government run monopoly on these \"special goods\" might be what is actually needed at the moment for the revolutionary government to survive.

CHI.lategame.065.d: "When he was deposed as a child in 1912 and put into de facto house arrest in the Forbidden City, few thought Puyi would ever be a threat. After all, the monarchy was deeply unpopular and the fledging Republic had far more pressing problems to deal with than a hapless toddler. But alas, strongmen came and went starting with Yuan Shikai, and many ignorantly attempted to hoist a monarchy onto the people. The Germans, in all their arrogance, insisted on restoring Puyi to his so-called \"birthright\", as if the snuffing out of the Xinhai dream could be any more complete.\n\nBut the republican dream of freedom did not die with the end of the Northern Expedition. And now, with our Republic at last restored across China there leaves one final matter to attend to as we turn the page in China's story. Puyi has grown into a vile, wicked man - taught little practical skills and a sadistic, childish personality. Or so our propaganda says. The reality is the man has been a puppet his entire life, and [CHI.GetLeader] has already ruled out a public execution of the deposed Emperor as excessive. There is little for our government to gain besides unneeded comparisons to Lenin. So there remain a few options.\n\nThe first would be to simply exile him to whichever state is willing to take him in. While this would effectively wash our government's hands of this matter, some question if this would pose a major security risk. Another possibility is to order him confined in the Forbidden City under house arrest, keeping him out of sight until he dies forgotten. Many however feel this is too similar to the unpopular articles written after Puyi's first abdication, and also allows for the effective embodiment of reactionary evil to go unpunished for his treasonous deeds. The final, and perhaps most radical proposal, would be to attempt to rehabilitate Puyi. This would entail a substantive effort to retrain the man to live like his fellow citizens as another comrade in a larger revolution."

CHI.lategame.066.d: "A popular tourist attraction in [GetVictoryPointName_9843] is the city's once closed-off Forbidden Palace, the home of the Ming and Manchu emperors and now a public museum dedicated to showcasing the brilliance of Chinese civilisation. If one arrives at the palace museum garden early in the afternoon, they might run into a rather scrawny and plain-clothed-dressed gardener tending to the flowers, who is more than eager to point out and lecture on the Palace's treasures as well as things he had used in his youth. Spectators and tourists are beyond astonished when they realise that the old gardener is none other than the former Xuantong emperor - Puyi, himself.\n\nFollowing his capture by NRA forces during the completing stages of the Second Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang decided to remodel him into a model citizen in tune with the ideals of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The former emperor and captured Fengtian and Japanese soldiers were sent to a prisoner-of-war camp during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Here, the former emperor was observed as unable to perform even basic tasks such as brushing his teeth and tying his shoes, much to the amusement of his captors. During his \"re-education,\" Puyi met with those who had suffered due to famine and economic failure in both the former League of Eight Provinces and Zhili Province - as a testament to the consequences of his collaborations with the Germans.\n\nAfter several long years in re-education, the Party's Central Committee officially voted to suspend Puyi's sentence and release him as a productive member of the New China. He has recently gotten remarried to a hospital nurse named Li Shuxian and, with the encouragement of the Party, hopes to complete his autobiography. These days, he denounces imperialism, claims he was a coward, and betrayed his country by working with the Germans. A very clumsy man who has had his needs taken care of his whole life, he reportedly now finds much more happiness than when he was the Emperor of China and is known by some locals as a rather kind and humble man.

CHI.lategame.067.d: "After the National Revolutionary Army swept into Urga and drove out all before them, the joys of victory were soon replaced by the difficult reality of governing such a wide, sparsely populated land. Mongolia has few permanent settlements and remains deeply poor and agrarian. Despite claims of national unification and equality among the five races, many Mongolians have grown accustomed to independence and are deeply suspicious of Chinese nationalism.\n\nSerengdongrub (Bai Yunti in Chinese), a longtime Kuomintang member and RCA affiliate, has been installed Chairman of Mongolia. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has ostensibly been preparing ethnic minorities in the party for tutelage in their home regions, however their ranks remain very thin. Serengdongrub's Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party only had limited traction in inner Mongolia to the south.\n\nWith preexisting Kuomintang membership so limited, staffing for the new government has been supplemented by members of existing socialist and leftist groups in Mongolia, most notably the Mongol Ardin Nam (Mongolian People's Party) based primarily in western Mongolia. Their leaders have insisted on considerable concessions from the Han-dominated central government, though they often bicker and jockey among themselves for power.\n\nThe alternatives are not particularly savoury either. While most Russian-backed warlords have fled, the former Mongolian nobility and other conservative interests led by Unenbayan and Prince Demchugdongrub remain active. The more moderate elements in Urga such as Unenbayan have expressed openness to joining the Kuomintang, likely in hopes of continuing their entrenched influence over the area.\n\nThere is some doubt about whether or not these discussions ultimately matter for the common folk, especially as resistance is expected to continue. General Ulanhu, one of the highest ranking ethnic Mongolian military officers in the NRA, has been charged with maintaining order. Supposedly desk-mates with Chiang Ching-kuo while studying in the Internationale and having ties to military intelligence, some wonder about his loyalties. His family is said to have been already amassing considerable power among the locals."

CHI.lategame.068.t: "The Situation in Tibet"
CHI.lategame.068.d: "The conquest of Lhasa by the National Revolutionary army has placed the world's largest and most elevated plateau under the control of the Republic of China, though already trouble abounds in the new Tibetan administration. Having enjoyed de facto independence from China for decades now and having fought multiple wars to maintain it, many Tibetans are suspicious of the ambitions of the Chinese nationalism.\n\nWith the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission having been largely unsuccessful in creating a large cadre of Kuomintang members of ethnic Tibetan heritage, the party has turned to the allied Tibet Improvement Party formed in India with some help by exiled Kuomintang officers. The pro-Chinese 9th Panchen Lama (born Thubten Choekyi Nyima) has been installed as Chairman, though with plenty of Chinese \"advisors\" looking over his shoulder.\n\nThis has attracted complaints that the bureaucrats the Kuomintang have deployed have proven actively detrimental to creating a lasting, harmonious rule in the highlands. Many side-step the Chairman, reporting directly back to [CHI.capital.getcapitalvictorypointname] for oders. Tibetan Improvement Party leaders such as Pandatsang Rapga and Gendun Chophel have pleaded [CHI.GetLeader] and the Central Executive Committee for a freer hand, arguing that the TIP have long been loyal supporters of Dr. Sun's Three Principles and modernisation.\n\nWhether or not that is true is debateable, however in their efforts to overthrow reactionary rule it seems they have allied with \"democratic\" groups of various stripes under the promise of elections. These groups demand provisional elections during tutelage, adding to the instability gripping the region.\n\nIn wake of the growing power vacuum, more and more decisions have fallen upon General Huang Musong, the General-Advisor of Tibet sent west by Kuomintang many years ago as the provisional head of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. He has advised the creation of the Tibet Improvement Militia and has been given control of NRA forces in the region, the climax of decades of service."

CHI.lategame.069.t: "Intrigues in Xinjiang"
CHI.lategame.069.d: "The National Revolutionary Army's march into Dihua has seen the Republic of China become the latest Han government to attempt to extend their authority into the west. Covering a massive area, including much of the Taklamakan Desert, Xinjiang has seen considerable instability as Han authority crumbled. Resistance continues by local reactionaries and disgrunted nationalists, and Kuomintang control is strained by the long travel distance; some say it takes longer for a man in Singapore to return to Berlin than for one in Beijing to go to Dihua.\n\nForced to give some degree of autonomy to the local government, [CHI.GetLeader] has turned to Burhan Shahidi as their regional Chairman. An Uygur political figure fluent in multiple languages, he is also a graduate of Baoding military academy. Having translated Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles into Uyghur, he and his Tatar wife Rashida are said to be sympathetic to the Kuomintang.\n\nShort on reliable allies, the Kuomintang have been forced to cobble together an administration. Aksu has been home to many disaffected members of Yang Zengxin's old Xinjiang clique, including Sheng Shicai. The Han general has sought to enter our good graces, touting his \"Marxist\" credentials and past in the NRA and Guominjun. Pardoned of any prior crimes by the desperate Republic, he has been charged with reorganising the local security forces of the old regime, a decision we have had little time to regret.\n\nA showdown is looming between General Sheng and Chairman Shahidi, with [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] too distant and ignorant of the situation on the ground to stop them. Tao Zhiyue, one of General Zhang Zhizhong's close friends, has been appointed the provincial military governor though he complains that his authority is limited to only a few divisions in Dihua. He has begged for reinforcements, claiming otherwise he will be helpless to stop the situation from further deteriorating.\n\nWith the quagmire only growing, some wonder if we should \"wash our hands of the situation\", negotiating with local guerilla bands and leaving the region largely autonomous. This will likely doom Xinjiang's socialist future to the mercy of power-hungry men, but will at least allow Xinjiang to remain in Chinese hands at a minimal cost."

CHI.lategame.069.e: "Let's take a \"hands-off\" approach here."

CHI.lategame.070.t: "The Taiwan Dilemma"
CHI.lategame.070.d: "After decades of foreign rule, the National Revolutionary Army triumphantly arrived in Taipei, returning the island to Chinese control. Taiwan, sometimes referred to as Formosa, was seized by Japan during the first Sino-Japanese war and subject to colonisation - something that will take time to reverse. Still, the arrival of Chinese forces was greeted with significant fanfare by the locals and the party has thrown considerable weight into integrating the region.\n\nLocated just a few hundred kilometers from Fujian, interactions between anti-Japanese resistance fighters in Taiwan and the MinGan insurgency were relatively common. Dr. Jiang Weishui, a physician and a founder of the broad-tent Taiwanese Cultural Association (TCA), formed the Taiwanese People's Party (TPP) with inspiration from the Kuomintang. Dubbed by some as the island's Sun Yat-sen, he organised various leftist protests against Japanese rule and has since been rewarded with the Chairmanship by [CHI.GetLeader]. He and the TPP have generally received support from former MinGan officials, though their authoritarian style of management has made enemies.\n\nWith the TPP folding into the Kuomintang, Jiang's new administration has been dogged by lingering tensions within the Taiwanese resistance movement. Xie Xuehong, Jian Ji, and the radical left-wing of the TCA formed the Taiwanese Syndicalist Party after an acrimonious split. Bucking from Jiang's rule, they have appealed to [CHI.capital.getcapitalvictorypointname] and the League of Chinese Syndicalists, asking them to force Jiang to honour the terms of the original United Front.\n\nSuch an intervention would undermine the Chairman's rule, though some in the Central Executive Committee have proposed we go further and encourage Jiang to form a wider coalition with centre-right elements on the island. Healing the rifts between the TPP and their former allies in the TCA will not be easy, but may help with the integration process and protect the international legitimacy of China's claim to the region.\n\nThe ongoing difficulties of administering the island has made some wonder if Jiang is up for the task. Some have suggested local decision-making be curtailed for the time being and critical decisions be forwarded to [CHI.capital.getcapitalvictorypointname] for review."

### Section 3b  (200-399): 3rd Congress Event Chain

##Introduction (200-250)

CHI.lategame.200.t: "The White Sun Rises"
CHI.lategame.200.d: "China has been unified, but at a heavy cost. Thousands if not millions have died since the start of the warlord era, families have been divided and countless displaced from their homes. Yet in the end the Kuomintang has emerged the sole victor, destroying or outlasting the half dozen or so other factions that once dared vie for national leadership. The party of Sun Yat-sen is all that remains now, proof they claim of their revolution's moral superiority.\n\nThe truth, as always it seems, is murkier. The party had banded fiercely together against foreign invaders and domestic foes, united by nationalism and revolutionary promises. But even at the height of their accomplishments, there were cracks in this United Front, and with external threats receding the party is as divided as ever.\n\nThe people too have grown tied of the arbitrariness of de facto military rule, with an inconsistent application of civilian political tutelage and military governance across the nation. Surely, the masses are grateful of unification and celebrate the imperialists slinking back to their homelands, but they have also made clear their unwillingness to bear further sacrifice without a clear vision for the future.\n\nMatters are coming to a head, and observers are on the lookout for further instability in future political developments. As the party-state works to clean up scattered resistance, a growing chorus of voices have demanded another special national congress held by the Kuomintang, this time with full representation from across the realm."
CHI.lategame.200.a: "Another Congress awaits..."

CHI.lategame.201.t: "The Calling of the Third Repatriated Congress"
CHI.lategame.201.d: "Responding to public pressures, Wang Jingwei has announced on behalf of the Central Executive Committee plans for a special national congress to be held in Nanjing about three weeks from now. Formally known as the \"Third Repatriated National Congress of the Kuomintang\", despite its name it is expected that members of the League of Chinese Syndicalists and other aligned republicans will attend.\n\nAn itinerary has already been prepared with a list of topics to be discussed, though the elephant in the room is the fate of Wang Jingwei himself. The long-time Party Chairman and President of the Republic has cast a controversial shadow, despite his efforts to portray himself as a compromising figure. Many see him as a dictator in the making, increasingly untethered from the collective leadership of the CEC.\n\nHis list of enemies has grown as he and his allies have worked to consolidate power. Chief among these enemies is the Provisional Action Committee, an intra-party faction led by Song Qingling. She has worked to assemble Wang's rivals into a workable coalition. While much of the military is known to prefer to see Wang gone, few are willing to endorse an outright coup.\n\nInstead it appears both factions are entering the Third Congress with their knives sharpened. Only a select few know the full extent of either side's plan, but it is certain they will seek to assert dominance in the proceedings. The Third Congress will be the largest party congress yet, with over a thousand representatives hastily drawn from every province and county. Yet it still seems like the fate of millions will be decided by so few..."
CHI.lategame.201.a: "Destiny beckons!"

CHI.lategame.202.t: "The Occupation of Hankou"
CHI.lategame.202.d: "The torches shone bright as the procession marched, just after dusk. In the town of Hankou, one of the three that make up Wuhan, sat the German concession, established in 1895 in exchange for German support against Japan. The inland concessions in China are a remnant of the terrible international mandate system that has plagued China, and a 600 mu reminder of the century of humiliation.\n\nFacing the advance of the Kuomintang, most foreigners fled, leaving the concession effectively abandoned. Yet, due to fears of international condemnation, the cities were untouched during the second Northern Expedition. The Nationalist Government decided to respect their sovereignty for the time being, electing to wait for a better time for negotiations.\n\nFor many soldiers and students however, even this was too much. With the Japanese driven out of China in a deadly war, the nation has seen an upswing in nationalism. Tapping into this energy is the China Revival Society, an ultranationalistic band of officers who have denounced the concession of Hankou as void in the context of the Kuomintang's anti-imperialist policies.\n\nSpurred on by He Zhonghan, a large detachment of CRS officers marched into the concession areas in the city, targetting the German concession in particular as revenge for their role in the first Northern Expedition. Initially a disciplined formation, they were soon joined in by mobs of locals who proceeded to break windows and burn down foreign buildings in a riot. But perhaps even more startling to the press was the image of European flags being torn down and burned, and replaced with the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholly Red Earth."
CHI.lategame.202.a: "A long-awaited revenge."

CHI.lategame.203.t: "Avenging the Humiliations"
CHI.lategame.203.d: "The aftermath of the Hankou riot has reverberated across China as heated discussions about its implications fill the air. Many are horrified by the mob violence, while plenty other groups are jealous of the attention the CRS received - believing them to be taking undue credit for the entire party's anti-imperial efforts. Whatever the case, Wang has remained strategically silent as the country braces for imitators.\n\nOver the last few days, China has fallen to another wave of instability as riots have broken out throughout major Chinese cities, especially near the ports. Disturbing reports of anti-concessionist violence have filled the airwaves and overwhelmed the police, worsened by the wide-spread participation of security forces. Even areas still outside of Kuomintang control are expected to see instability.\n\nAs the mob violence spreads, they have begun to break down across factional lines. Socialist mobs have extended the campaign against capitalist oppressors, terrorising bourgeoisie neighbourhoods and commerical districts. Nationalist groups have cast even our MMIC advisors as foreign imperialists, taking a strident anti-European and anti-foreign tone. Many, particularly the CRS, accuse the LCS of being puppets of foreign control.\n\nWith the situation spiralling out of control, the military has finally been deployed to restore order. With curfews declared and more disciplined units sent in, the chaos has been brought to a close. But not before an MMIC officer was found dead."
CHI.lategame.203.a: "Our movement is being torn apart!"

CHI.lategame.204.t: "Fallout of the Nanjing Incident"
CHI.lategame.204.d: "In the aftermath of several days of rioting, there have been numerous casualties, but none as damaging as an advisor of the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine. Although most of the MMIC officers escaped unharmed, their headquarters was raided and ransacked during the unrest, apparently abandoned by Chinese security forces at the height of the violence. Three were wounded in the evacuation, one was killed.\n\nThe untimely fallen was one Jean Fontenoy, head of the training department. A decorated officer during the Great War and French revolution, he was sent to China as part of the original mission. A writer, playboy and opium addict, it was said he was considered at one point for head of the mission but was passed over due to his growing addiction and sympathies for the Sorelian movement. This attribute and his hands-on approach seems to have won over some members of the CRS, who came to pay their last respects before his body is sent home.\n\nAndré Malraux, the head of the mission, is outraged at the death of his former rival and has lashed out against what he believes to be a deliberate attempt against the lives of his men. In an angry meeting with the Central Executive Committee he has accused what he described as an \"India Clique\" of rightist officers of leading a conspiracy against the government, hoping to hijack the revolution on the cusp of their revolutionary victory. At he has fingered Generals Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue, the leaders of the old Chinese advisory group to Calcutta, as the centre of this nefarious cabal. He has gone so far as to claim he has eye-witnesses willing to testify of the two personally leading the mob.\n\nReconstruction Faction aligned CEC members including Sun Fo have immediately rose to Zhang's defence, angrily condemning what they claim are unsubstantiated rumour-mongering. But it is clear that the liberal faction of the party is under pressure, and it is likely many PAC-affiliated officers will go down with them. As Malraux is escorted from the meeting, the CEC has broken out into a heated discussion."
CHI.lategame.204.a: "Now wait just a second..."

CHI.lategame.205.t: "The [GetMonth] Instructions"
CHI.lategame.205.d: "As if things could not get much worse, a series of documents now-dubbed the [GetMonth] Instructions have made the front page news in major cities. The \"leakers\", who have chosen to remain anonymous, claim they were taken from leading MMIC Advisor M.N. Roy's office. In them include a series of telegrams apparently from Paris which contain a series of demands to be delivered to Wang Jingwei at an appropriate opportunity, ostensibly to help him consolidate power and maintain the Internationale's support:\n\n1.) The All-China Federation of Labour (affiliated with the CSP) is to be legalised, and all Chinese unions placed under it.\n2.) An influx of syndicalists must be recruited into the army, and syndicalist-aligned officers promoted. Officers too \"Old Guard\" must be retired, forcibly if necessary.\n3.) Likewise, the party must be cleanse of those with \"Old Mindsets\", replaced with younger socialists trained abroad.\n4.) Revolutionary military courts must be established to punish reactionaries.\n\nThe original \"leak\" has been tracked down to newspapers connected with the CRS, particularly Qian Tu (lit. \"Future\", \"Prospects\"), but has quickly been picked up by PAC and RF affiliated papers. Widely distributed within just a day or so, the contents effectively imply the MMIC hopes to sponsor a CSP coup d'etat.\n\nThe timing is incredibly suspicious, and the contents have denounced as a forgery by Roy. Roy notes that he has been with the revolution since the beginning, and his close ties with both factions of the party. But with the MMIC on the defensive, Li Jishen has taken advantage of the moment to break his silence since the Nanjing incident. In a thundering speech, he has demanded the Internationale's military mission promptly expelled, claiming they wish to take advantage of their comrade's death to initiate a powergrab.\n\nHe has produced a long list of officers who have threatened to resign in protest if the \"prejudiced\" investigation into the alleged \"India Clique\" proceeds, with his name at the top of the list. Conversely however, if the MMIC is expelled, it is expected many of the thousands of officers they had trained will resign in solidarity."
CHI.lategame.205.a: "Expel the MMIC at once!"
CHI.lategame.205.b: "Dismiss the India Clique!"

CHI.lategame.206.t: "Wang's Opening Speech"
CHI.lategame.206.d: "The Third National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang has officially been convened in the grand capital city of [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], heralding the start of a new age for [CHI.GetNameDef]. At long last, the great war of resistance against the Japanese imperialists had been concluded, and the region of Manchuria restored properly to the Chinese nation. Chairman [CHI.GetLeader] once more took to the stand under a grandiose portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the flags of the Party draped along its sides. What was different, however, was a newly commissioned portrait of the Chairman that was placed strategically to the right of the eternal premier - a move that was marked with looks of scorn and anger by members of the PAC.\n\nWang began his speech by thanking the Party for following true to the principles of Dr. Sun and for the martyrs who had sacrificed their lives during the War of Resistance. While the revolution's phase of military rule is hereby concluded with the NRA's recent victory over the Japanese, the revolution's Party rule must continue as Wang warned of reactionaries within the ranks of the Party who threaten to destablise it. Nonetheless, a party reshuffle is bound to happen with the election of a new Central Executive Committee and Chairman anticipated to happen.\n\nWhile he has long remained apolitical from the quarrels of the RCA and the PAC, he concluded in his opening remarks that he believed a new reorganisation of the Party is needed to emulate the same changes to the party in 1924. He denounced the conservatives within the India Clique and the Reconstruction Faction as \"degenerate forces\" stifling the spirit of the Reorganisation. This spirit had won the Second Northern Expedition. Wang concluded his remarks with a firm acknowledgment that while the United Front policy with the Chinese syndicalists was not an aspect of the First Reorganisation, it was a grave mistake if denunciation of the policy should lead to the rejection of the Spirit of the Reorganisation.\n\nWhile scores of cheers rang out from the delegates of the RCA and members of the CSP, only polite applause was heard from the PAC's section of the Congress while members of the World Society and the Reconstruction Faction stayed silent."
CHI.lategame.206.a: "An inauspicious start..."

CHI.lategame.207.t: "A League Divided..."
CHI.lategame.207.d.LCS: "For years the League of Chinese Syndicalists have adopted the French political methodology of the \"syndicalist compromise\" with its multiple factions and unions coalescing under a shared alliance of the proletarian struggle. Cooperating with the Chinese Kuomintang in strikes such as the Hong Kong-Canton Strikes of 1925 as well as the Shanghai Uprising of 1932, the policy of the Chinese socialists outside of the Kuomintang has long been of one of convenience - especially due to the instruction of Paris and London.\n\nWith the Kuomintang's victory in the Second Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance, the League has grown noticeably in terms of influence and now finds itself being courted by the Provisional Action Committee and the Reorganised Comrades Association in their struggle for dominance of the Party."
CHI.lategame.207.d.ORT: "$CHI.lategame.207.d.LCS$\n\nAmongst the factions of the LCS, the Orthodox Faction of the Chinese Syndicalist Party has grown in much strength over the years with its members Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao, and Li Lisan controlling much of the LCS' functions and directions. Now they are faced with the decision on whether or not to support Chairman Wang's new declaration of Reorganisation - with their influence, they can most surely tip the scales for both the PAC and RCA."
CHI.lategame.207.d.RAD: "$CHI.lategame.207.d.LCS$\n\nAmong the factions of the LCS, the radical and young guard faction of the Chinese Syndicalist Party has grown in much strength over the years, with its members Qin Bangxian, Qiu Qibai, and Chen Shaoyu controlling much of the LCS' functions and directions. The new school of syndicalist thought is undoubtedly empathetic to the beliefs of the RCA-radicals. Faced with Chairman Wang's renewed call for Reorganisation, they rally to the defense of the revolution."
CHI.lategame.207.d.WRD: "$CHI.lategame.207.d.LCS$\n\nAmongst the faction of the LCS, the Old guard of the anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists have grown considerably in strength over the years, in the form of the World Society. While initially much weaker than other socialist and syndicalist movements, their influence has risen tremendously especially due to their leaders, who are regarded as the Four Elders of the Kuomintang. Empathetic to their fellow utopian socialists in the PAC, their support has hardened in face of Chairman Wang's new declaration of Reorganisation; they have thrown their weight behind ousting the red tyrant."
CHI.lategame.207.a: "We stand against reactionary subversion!"
CHI.lategame.207.b: "Wang has become too much of a danger!"

CHI.lategame.208.t: "The Liberals Push on!"
CHI.lategame.208.d: "The Reconstruction Faction has managed to survive across the collapse of the first Northern Expedition, the exile period, and the revival of Kuomintang fortunes. And yet, there was some doubt how long after they would last before fading into oblivion, abandoned by an increasingly socialist party. The Third Congress, many believed, would be their last hurrah before they were sidelined - at best perhaps Sun Fo and a few other high-level members would be able to scrounge up a favourable sinecure.\n\nIf that was the case however, they did not show it today. The Reconstruction Faction, in their unofficial caucus meetings, have acted as lively as ever - freshly energised by the fact that civilian rule is right around corner. In their minds, the end of war means the end of military dominance in priorities, giving the primarily civilian-based RF a leg up over both the PAC and RCA.\n\nSun Fo has sought to reinvent himself and his clique as through and through liberals, proponents of constitutionalism, anti-corruption, and the immediate end of tutelage. Casting himself as a democratic hero, he has denounced the one-party state as incompatiable with his father's ideals, and with the final unification of China he claims it is time for a change. His writings make it clear his target audience - the thousands of moderate, republican intellegentsia who have long been treated as window-dressing by successive governments.\n\nWith the Congress in full swing, Sun has been sure to be photographed and interviewed at just about every opportunity - sincerely (some would say deludely) believing himself to be Wang's leading opposition figure. He has openly begun calling the Chairman a dictator to the press, challenging him to commit to immediate, free, and fair elections nation-wide if he isn't. Not exceptionally charismatic, Sun nonetheless is a household name and handshake by handshake he is shaping up to be a threat."
CHI.lategame.208.a: "In defence of constitutionalism!"

CHI.lategame.209.t: "The Long Shadow"
CHI.lategame.209.d: "Outside the convention halls, the fixers and schemers operate. These \"lobbyists\" were hoped by some to be confined to corrupt bourgeoisie \"democracies\" and the degenerate Beiyang establishment, but are unfortunately alive and well in Nationalist China. Wielding carefully placed \"gifts\", promises of job prospects, and a wide array of threats (they may or may not be able to back up), they have engaged in negotiations with the wives, \"uncles\", and \"friends\" of the delegates.\n\nBut these are perhaps the least of the budding Chinese democracy's worries. Operating in even more underhanded methods are the scurrying agents of the Laoban, who casts a long shadow over the convention. Politicians boast about their plots and plans, but few can match the sheer ruthlessness and violence of China's spymasters who have battled in the dark on behalf of their factions. There are multiple reports of delegates who have decided to resign their seat in advance of the convention for \"health reasons\" and numerous cases of sudden shifts in allegiances.\n\nTragically however, there is little time or energy to investigate this epidemic of poor health, with all factions focusing their energy at the conference at hand. In an interesting development, observers have noted that this Congress has the first appearance of what seems to be a CRS-aligned caucus. Led by former student-radical and army officer Liu Butong, they are joined by minor party celebrity Chiang Ching-kuo, the first-born son of Chiang Kai-shek. This group is believed to be the source of multiple sordid rumours going around the Congress about Wang, accusing him of tales of betrayal, corruption, and even murder - notably of the late Headmaster."
CHI.lategame.209.a: "You think this is bad? This buffoonery? They've done worse!"

CHI.lategame.210.t: "The Impeachment Vote"
CHI.lategame.210.d: "At long last, enough was enough. Since before the opening of the Third Congress, the Provisional Action Committee has gotten to work to ensure that Chinese democracy does not die with the dictatorial desires of Wang.  PAC and WMARCA members have secretly threatened, bribed, and cajoled members of the Congress to vote in favour of the PAC's attempt to upstage Wang. They have reached out to members of the League of Chinese Syndicalists, the Reconstruction Faction, and even some RCA-Moderates - scrounging every vote they can in their favor.\n\nWith an unprecedented volume of votes from the members of the Congress, high-ranking members of the PAC such as Deng Yanda and Zhang Bojun, have presented to the Central Supervisory Committee of the Central Committee a demand in the \"Case of Wang Jingwei's failure to carry out Duties as Acting Chairman.\" With the Four Elders of the Kuomintang making up all but one of the Central Supervisory Committee members, impeachment was inevitable. However, a conviction requires a vote by the entire Congress, and that remains up in the air. Without it, impeachment by the Supervisory Committee holds little weight.\n\nWith the charges delivered, Song Qingling herself has gotten up out of her seat to denounce Wang in the name of her husband. While Wang may surely have been a comrade of Dr. Sun's, Song declared that Wang must resign at once in order to end the phase of tutelage. The Congress lies stunned in silence as Wang Jingwei stands up to defend himself..."

#Additional 3rd Congress Events
CHI.lategame.211.t: "The Kuomintang National Congress"
CHI.lategame.211.d: "With all their rivals beaten or subdued, and seemingly no one left to stop them from claiming leadership over China, the Kuomintang led [CHI.GetNameDef] has called a third National Congress of their expanded party, drawing representatives from all provinces in the nation. Accordingly, [ROOT.GetLeader] and members of the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] have been invited as delegates to Nanjing to consult on the future of China.\n\nHaving successfully united the nation, we have found that the Kuomintang seem determined to divide it from within. With rancorous speeches against one another, endless gossip, and underhanded politiking, even the least astute members of the delegation could sense the air of tension at the Congress. At the centre of the controversy is the nation's victorious Chairman Wang Jingwei - with the various factions of the party lining up for and against him. It seems like the fragmented opposition have gathered around the figure of Song Qingling, though there is plenty of dissent within the anti-Wang bloc that threatens to scuttle their efforts.\n\nVarious agents of both camps have tried to draw our [ROOT.GetAdjective] delegates into their orbit, offering grandiose promises, copius bribes (of various sorts), and shady threats. With the suffocating air of division, it has been difficult to press our own concerns of the future - our interests drowned out by the competing sides. As the days go on, we have to wonder how much peace the party-state's victory will genuinely bring."

#Inform FRA and INT of the Fate of the MMIC

CHI.lategame.220.intro: "The Kuomintang have long received our extensive support, perhaps most directly through the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine (MMIC). Despite this generosity, nationalist jealousy and intra-party bickering resulted in an animosity between the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) Old Guard and the MMIC, as NRA officers sought scapegoats for their growing pile of shortcomings.\n\nEven on the cusp of victory, the eastern proletarian wave continues to be undermined by Kuomintang disunity, the discord unleashing a wave of violence across the newly liberated nation ahead of an important party congress. Three MMIC advisors were wounded, and one killed - lynched by a mob identified as sympathetic to the reactionary \"India Clique\" of the NRA."
CHI.lategame.220.expelled: "This nefarious cabal, with the willing participation of the NRA Old Guard, has successfully spun the situation in their favour - planting lies about MMIC meddling and convincing Kuomintang leadership to expel the mission altogether. This move, condemned by the [FRA.GetAdjective] government, raises major questions about our so-called \"comrades'\" judgement."
CHI.lategame.220.purged: "This nefarious cabal, led by many former officers themselves sent on an advisory mission to the Indian revolution, has been suspended from their post pending further investigation. This decision, made with only begrudgingly support from the Old Guard, betrays the increasingly erratic judgement of the Kuomintang, facing spasms of violence with the lost of a commmon enemy."
CHI.lategame.220.bio: "The deceased's name was Jean Fontenoy, once a decorated soldier in the Great War and French Syndicalist revolution. Born poor, his intelligence, courage and dedication to the socialist cause allowed him to rise in the early French military, and he was sent to east to China in advance of the Northern Expedition as an advisor. There he became an alcohol, opium addict, and playboy, though covered the Kuomintang revolution extensively in his writings. Once considered for overall leadership of the MMIC, his growing vices and sympathies for Sorelianism saw him passed over in favour of the more popular André Malraux. Still, he will be missed."
CHI.lategame.220.funeral: "The body will take several weeks to return home, though [FRA.GetLeader] has already publicly promised his family a state funeral, among other awards. His personal record has been cleansed of any improprieties and Malraux (his former rival) has sent home a rather generous eulogy as the nation mourns."

##Scenario 1: Wang carries the day (250-299)
CHI.lategame.250.t: "Wang Carries the Day!"
CHI.lategame.250.d: "Standing up to his feet, Wang quickly denied the allegations directed towards him. He declared brazenly and boldly that he was merely following the late Leader's instructions. Was it not integral to the concept of a Reorganised Party that it was the duty of the Party to instruct that Three Princples of the People? The Three Principles that, through their propagation, serve as the only means to save the nation? How can any true Kuomintang member say that party members should not strive for the fulfillment of this doctrine? If Dr. Sun's teachings are to be carried out, the Party as a living organ must indeed be reorganised so that a common goal, organisation, and discipline can be strengthened!\n\nWith his mesmeric hand gestures and his dramatic pauses, he concluded his speech with a thunderous applause. The Provisional Action Committee found itself stunned and humiliated. In a dramatic roll-call vote, the Congress voted not to convict and Wang was soon voted in for another term as Chairman of the Party. At a brisk pace, Wang sought his revenge - rapidly reshuffling government posts and naming a new CEC filled with RCA and Residence Faction loyalists.\n\nWith the majority of the Congress remaining loyal to the RCA, members of PAC and political rivals of the RCA such as the Reconstruction Faction have left the capital for the city of Wuhan, where General Deng Yanda has proclaimed a rebellion to \"save the National Revolution.\" As officers in the NRA begin taking sides, the China Revival Society has remained silent regarding the dramatic developments, but one can never expect silence from Hu and his shadowy cadre of followers.\n\nWuhan has been declared a free city and forces opposed to the Wang Jingwei regime are expected to converge there, make their stand 550km from the capital. It is clear that if Wang is to hold on to his recent conquest of the Congress, he must act deal with the Wuhan Government quickly."
CHI.lategame.250.a: "The traitors' gambit has failed."

CHI.lategame.251.t: "The Assault on Wuhan"
CHI.lategame.251.d: "Having received direct orders from the Chairman, General Zhang Zhizhong was ordered to bring several veteran and elite NRA divisions to crush the uprising in Wuhan. The military ordered a full assault on the city of Wuhan equipped with heavy artillery and light bombers; nothing short of unconditional surrender was to be demanded from the rebel factions.\n\nAt dawn the city of Wuhan became yet another battleground with ongoing artillery shelling and gunfire from both sides as loyalist forces stormed the city. However, it was clear that the military advantage of the Nanjing Government was too much to bear for the PAC militias, who immediately began plans to evacuate to their heartland and base of popular support, the province of Fujian.\n\nSong Qingling's face was full of tears as she saw the slain and wounded comrades that had fought with her since the Fujian Insurgency. Unwilling to throw more lives away in the revolutionary struggle, she sent word at once to Wang's government - to negotiate the surrender of all PAC and anti-Wang forces. Despite the chagrin of her closest friend and ally, General Deng Yanda, who still believed that PAC forces could rally and fight back - Song Qingling, Song Ziwen, and other civilian leaders within the PAC have offered their full surrender to Wang and the Nanjing Government. The Party's fighting and war seems to have ended... for now."

CHI.lategame.251.b: "Bring down an iron fist."

#Apply a Gentlehand (261-270)
CHI.lategame.261.t: "The Awkward Peace"
CHI.lategame.261.d: "An awkward sense of peace has returned to [CHI.GetNameDef] with the Provisional Action Committee thoroughly disintigerated as a political organisation. Under the instruction of the NRA, PAC's militias were to be disbanded and the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association prohibited as a formal organisation. Ever pragmatic and playing the role of the humble Chairman, Chairman Wang Jingwei has officially announced amnesty for all those who fought against him - citing that now was a time of healing not war.\n\nThe press of the Reorganised Comrades Association has meanwhile been busy printing out publications discarding the movement - headlines screaming Deng Yanda and Song Qingling's rumoured romantic relationship have been common along with other accusations of PAC corruption and voter intimidation. It has been reported that Wang has ordered all publications slandering the widow of the eternal premier to cease, but nonetheless such accusations have certainly earned the anger of the every headstrong Deng.\n\nPerhaps thinking the amnesty rule and his own position in the Kuomintang protects him, Deng has in recent days criticised the new government's leadership - citing that they are no different than the reactionaries whom they fought in the Second Northern Expedition. There are whispers... whispers in the dark that unless Deng does not cease his protests, the Chairman may be inclined to act."
CHI.lategame.261.a: "Can he just be silent?"

CHI.lategame.262.t: "Reassuring Our Partners"
CHI.lategame.262.d: "Chairman Wang has dispatched his trusted friend and comrade Chen Gongbo to discuss with the the Chinese syndicalists on establishing a renewed united front to secure greater internationale support. While Chen is firmly aligned with the ideals of the Nationalist Party and of the Reorganised Comrades Association, he was once a powerful labourer organiser within the Chinese Syndicalist Party - and many within the CSP radicals have read his works and acknowledge him as a prominent socialist in his own right. As the League of Chinese Syndicalists splits into factional conflict, Chen has approached the Chinese Syndicalist Party itself and has found agreement with both the Orthodox and Radical factions whom have acknowledged Wang's leadership of the Party.\n\nIn the meantime, the Chairman has been busy at work undertaking the party reorganisation. Only those who are members of the RCA and whom have pledged loyalty to the RCA and Wang have been allowed to receive membership within the Legislative Yuan. A new reorganisation is underway and the RCA's vision for a fully unified party grows stronger day after day..."
CHI.lategame.262.a: "Favour the Orthodox."
CHI.lategame.262.b: "Work with the Radicals."

CHI.lategame.263.t: "The Prodigal Son"
CHI.lategame.263.d: "As the PAC-led opposition to Wang fizzles out, a sense of normalcy has returned to the Legislative Yuan. Most members of the Reconstruction Faction have been allowed to return to their seats without hassle, though how long this liberal fifth-column will be tolerated is an open question. As a preliminary measure, they have been put under extensive surveillance for any further subversion and caucus meetings have been openly monitored.\n\nWith any potential military muscle to their ideas evaporated with the collapse of the Wuhan rebellion, the best they can do is meekly mew about constitutional principles. If this is the route we would prefer, a \"gentle\" hand of intimidation and blackmail should be sufficient to keep them contained. For the \"Crown Prince\" himself a few embarrassing secrets have already been dug up, including his long-time illict affair with his former secretary Yan Aijuan, with whom he has fathered a daughter with. Sun Fo it seems has fallen behind on his hush-money payments, bankrupted by his political efforts. This and another affair would make be an unfortunate source of embarrassment should it be leaked to the press, something Sun has been made well aware of.\n\nNot everyone in the old Reconstruction Faction wishes to serve as a pliant, controlled-opposition. Many members of the bourgeoisie, who believed Sun Fo could live up to his promise to prevent a full socialist takeover of the party, have taken what assets they could and fled abroad like the traitors they are. With the power now in Wang's hands, perhaps they have already played the role we needed, and would be better served overseas. Sending Sun to America as Ambassador, or to tour Southeast Asia as head of the Overseas Chinese Commission or even back to Honolulu as head of some cultural organisation - it matters little. As long as he's out of the picture, we have little to fear."
CHI.lategame.263.a: "Fear will keep them in line."
CHI.lategame.263.b: "We have no use for them anymore."

CHI.lategame.264.t: "The Final Warning"
CHI.lategame.264.d: "Deng has been relentless in his criticisms of Chairman Wang. In a recent public speech to party members, Deng described Wang as a venomous opportunist, a snake in the Party who was merely turning the comrades against one another contrary to the ideals of the late Dr. Sun. Wang is a patient man but his patience grows thin. Day after day, Deng has lobbed insults towards Wang and his family - in particular his wife, who Deng has disaffectionately referred to as \"laotaipo\" (the old woman). Despite their differences, there is a degree of respect between the two men - both are early Cantonese party members and both worked and studied in Europe during the Kuomintang's exile. Yet for Wang, the Residence Faction (especially Chen Bijun), have been pressuring Wang to take out the threat once and for all.\n\nIn the dead of night, Li Shiqun, Wang's bodyguard and trusted hand suddenly received summons from the Chairman to his office. After a brief discussion, Wang quietly instructed Li to \"do something about Deng\" and to take him out before he becomes too much of a threat to the revolution. At once Li agreed and the plans have been drawn up to either have secret services abduct and strangle Deng in the middle of the night or to shoot him in broad daylight as to make an example of all traitors to the Kuomintang."
CHI.lategame.264.a: "In broad daylight, as a warning for all."
CHI.lategame.264.b: "Do in his car, make it quiet and painless."

CHI.lategame.265.t: "Exorcising the Shadow"
CHI.lategame.265.d: "The news of Deng's death slowly trickled in. Wang did not bother to fake much surprise at the turn of events, and most senior members of the party knew what happened anyway, though kept their mouth shut. The message sank in all the same. All but the closest of Deng's associates had cut ties with him by this point, and even his inner circle could do little but sit helplessly.\n\nSong Qingling has fallen into a deep grief, one people say she had not expressed since her husband died. Whether she really was having an affair with Deng or if they truly were like brother and sister like they said was moot: she will not be much of a threat in the future. Her request to leave the country and go into exile has been denied, she will probably spend the rest of her life in effective house arrest, with agents watching her from the shadows.\n\nSpeaking of which, the blame for Deng's death was assigned to the elusive, sinister forces of the military deep-state. Dai Chunfeng was publicly charged for the crime and arrested before he could slink back underground. A convenient scapegoat, removing him kills two birds with one stone. Few will believe his pleas of innocence during the show-trial - a fitting end to a monster.\n\nHis associates are another question. For better or for worse, Hu Zongnan and his clique have a degree of popularity and make up a major segment of the \"Young Guard\" that by and large remained loyal to us during the PAC rebellion. Even though they did not join with the rebels, they are still a threat, and if there was any time to eliminate them, now would be it."
CHI.lategame.265.a: "They will join him in the gallows!"
CHI.lategame.265.b: "They will be shuffled into irrelevance."

#Bring Down the Iron Fist (271-280)
CHI.lategame.271.t: "The Palace Coup"
CHI.lategame.271.d: "With peace talks stalled, the war continues. Chen Bijun and the Residence Faction did not wait for matters to shake out before they made their move. From top to bottom, they worked to consolidate the President's grip over the Executive Yuan - insisting on utter, dogmatic loyalty to Chairman Wang. Reconstruction Faction, Provisional Action Committee, independents, and even some wavering members of the Reorganised Comrades Association and League of Chinese Syndicalists were removed from their positions across the bureaucracy, replaced with an obedient mixture of Residence Faction scions and die-hard RCA members.\n\nSuch a blatant power-grab would be unthinkable even a few months ago, but there is no one left to oppose this self-coup. Whatever friction between the Residence Faction and RCA leadershp appears to have temporarily subsided as they circle the wagons to protect their shared master. Like the patronage networks of old, unquestioning loyalty is rewarded and there is no shortage of prospective \"clients\" for the pro-Wang political machine. In some cases, outright loyalty tests have been demanded - the Residence Faction living up to their derogatory \"Palace Faction\" nickname.\n\nWithin just a few weeks, the work was done. Chen Bijun, Chu Minyi, and Zeng Zhongming have done their job well - the patrons of this reformed hiearchy. Wang's place at the top has been entrenched and they have built a buzzing army of magistrates waiting to carry out his every word."
CHI.lategame.271.a: "One nation. One government. One vision."

CHI.lategame.272.t: "Gu Shunzhang's Betrayal"
CHI.lategame.272.d: "The schemes in Nanjing have not gone away, even as the nation lurches towards civil war. The weeks leading up to the crisis, it was evident that all factions were firing off desperate gambits, working any angle to get ahead of their opponents. Often the fog of war conceals intrigue until it is too late, we are very lucky to have learned thanks to some well-placed sources of a devastating defection: that of Gu Shunzhang.\n\nGu Shunzhang was a founding member of Zhou Enlai's Red Squad, his family have always been prominent revolutionaries and he was even considered a potential candidate for the Central Executive Committee. One of Zhou Enlai's chief lieutenants, he was known for his cunning personality, courage under fire, taciturn matter of speech and strong personality.\n\nThe latter attribute, combined with general clique-ishness in the Red Squad and concerns about his personality pushed Zhou and Chen Geng to consider reassigning him from his position. Perhaps he learned of this and that's why he flipped. Or maybe he feared Wang would not be in power too long and wanted to join the winning side. Maybe he was blackmailed into it. Whatever the case, it appears that through his former connections with the Green Gang he has switched his allegiance to Dai Chunfeng and his rival League of Ten.\n\nThe Hu Zongnan and the CRS have been exploiting the chaos to their own ends and Dai is an integral part to their covert operations. What he is planning specifically remains a closely guarded secret, but it is surely nothing good. With such a valuable asset in his camp, he knows of most of our embedded agents and most vital operations - a disaster in the making."
CHI.lategame.272.a: "We must act quickly!"

CHI.lategame.273.t: "Triumph of the Red Squad"
CHI.lategame.273.d: "Zhou Enlai, busy with many other commitments, often delegated out most of his responsibilities with the Red Squad to his lieutenants, but given the severity of the situation he has personally taken charge of handling the Gu Shunzhang affair. Unbeknownst to Dai Chunfeng, Zhou has an ace of his own up his sleeve - an agent at the very heart of CRS operations.\n\nXiong Xianghui has been Hu Zongnan's personal secretary and leading staff officer since his return to China. His father was a prominent judge with powerful connections and a bright young officer on his own right, he was recruited as a student by the Red Squad and sent to infiltrate Hu Zongnan's branch of the \"Young Guard\". One way or another he became a favourite of General Hu, all the while passing critical information to Zhou about CRS operations.\n\nWith Xiong's help, the CRS's next secret meeting place was uncovered - one that Dai Chunfeng would be sure to attend. In a carefully timed operation, Zhou ordered meeting to be ambushed by the Red Squad, decapitating the snake before it could strike. Hu Zongnan, Dai Chunfeng, He Zhonghan, Deng Wenyi and other leading CRS commanders were all killed by the elite squad- and not a day too soon. With the bulk of loyalist forces outside of the capital fighting the rebellion, they were attending a final meeting before executing a coup d'etat of their own.\n\nThe Red Squad's revenge on Gu Shunzhang was similarly brutal. He and his entire family was exterminated, over three dozen close family and extended kinsmen, shot or strangled by Red Squad agents. The only survivor of the massacre were his three year old daughter and two year old nephew, a graphic punishment long reserved for traitors to the socialist cause. It is one Gu himself had carried out before in the past, and he is said to have accepted his fate as our agents convenged on him.\n\nWith his rival vanquished and Nanjing saved, all that's left to handle is the scattered survivors of Dai's outfit, running around like a headless chicken."
CHI.lategame.273.a: "Absorb Dai Chunfeng's operation."
CHI.lategame.273.b: "Exterminate the pit of vipers."

CHI.lategame.274.t: "Fujian Falls at Last!"
CHI.lategame.274.d: "The Jiangxi-Fujian zone was the base of Kuomintang insurgency operations, the last remaining holdout of Kuomintang resistance after the 1932 Shanghai Uprising. With favourable terrain, sympathetic locals, and indomitable fighters wave after wave of encirclement campaigns failed to break them. They held out against Sun Chunfang and his League for nearly a decade, his German-trained divisions and concessionist funding notwithstanding. They resisted encroachment by even Kuomintang magistrates send to reorganise them. And led by Deng Yanda, they were determined to fight off their former comrades in the National Revolutionary Army.\n\nThe campaign was fierce and deadly. Although many WMARCA officers ultimately looked the other way when Deng called upon them to resist Wang and many more defected after the loss of Wuhan, the ones who remained were often fanatical veterans of decades of experience between them. Hidden storehouses, well-placed bunkers, and reactivated communications from the old insurgency similarly made Fujian a tough nut to crack. As the army made their advance, well-trained commandoes ambushed loyalist columns, pinning them down as rebel conventional forces worked to outflank them.\n\nBut the new National Revolutionary Army is not the same as Sun's drug-addicted, foreign boot-licking farce. With an effective, non-corrupt logistical infrastructure and divisions well-versed and well-equipped for modern warfare, they shattered rebel forces. Nimble, fast-moving motorised units neutralised the guerilla threat and in the end Fujian was theirs.\n\nDeng Yanda died in battle, probably the way he would've preferred - surrounded by his comrades. Song Qingling was captured in her citadel and was taken to Nanjing to be placed under house arrest, her commanders surrendered one by one as news of the \"Red Napoleon's\" death made its way across the province. Fighting is on-going, though any hope of the rebellion succeeding has been snuffed out. Still, the region is a hot-bed for rebellion and has long been the bastion of resistance against the Chairman."
CHI.lategame.274.a: "Place the province under martial law."
CHI.lategame.274.b: "Give amnesty to surrendering remnants."

CHI.lategame.275.t: "The Crown Prince Flees"
CHI.lategame.275.d: "After Wuhan fell, Sun Fo and most of his clique fled for safety. Not cut out for life as a rebel, most sought refuge in safe-houses in large port cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou. With any hope of ousting Wang crushed, their ambitions of subverting China's socialist destiny has been brought to an end. Seeing this, most of the grandees of the Reconstruction Faction have taken their leave, fleeing abroad for expatriat communities and/or find refuge in sympathetic bourgeoisie states.\n\nAmong them is Sun Fo, whose dreams of carrying on the torch of his father's legacy has once more been frustrated. Discontented and realising the futility in pushing any further for a Chinese state built along liberal lines, he has resigned his remaining government positions to go on sabbatical. He claims he intends to go on a goodwill tour to visit overseas Chinese communities on behalf of the party, helping to sponsor \"cultural dialogue\" with the Chinese diaspora. In many ways, he is back to where he started, the Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Commission.\n\nSun's decision to go into exile has calmed down fears of any further instability and saves Wang the awkwardness of having him in Nanjing. The funding he has requested is a pittance all things considered, just enough to pay for his lifestyle and make him seem like he's doing something useful. Still, there have been calls to cut ties with him for good, formally disowning him from his father's party. To many radicals, he is a disgrace to his father and shall die knowing that."
CHI.lategame.275.a: "Make him an ambassador of our people."
CHI.lategame.275.b: "Disown him from the party!"

##Scenario 1 Wrapup (290-299)
CHI.lategame.290.t: "The True Heir of the Revolution"
CHI.lategame.290.d: "Wang has achieved his dream at last, having spent the best years of his life fighting and clawing his way to it. He is now the undisputed heir of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the master of China and finally has the power to change the nation for the better. He has come a long way from being the son of a failed scholar and a failed revolutionary assassin.\n\nWhile he basks in his glory, the politics of the nation are being shaped in his image. The Residence Faction, led by his wife Chen Bijun, his brother-in-law Chu Minyi, and secretary Zeng Zhongming have taken centre stage, consolidating their power through their hold over the Executive Yuan. They have done so at the expense of their long-time rivals within Wang's camp, the Reorganised Comrades Association - the political machine that has served Wang faithfully for years.\n\nThe RCA remains divided into camps of their own. Emboldened by the power they believe they now possess, the radicals led by Chen Gongbo, Wang Faqin, Guo Chuntao and the Gu brothers have proposed wide-reaching reforms to modernise China. They hope to redefine the United Front and draw the LCS closer to them, historically having pro-CSP voices such as Shi Cuntong, Xiao Zhuyu, Xu Deheng and Liu Kanyuan.\n\nThe smaller RCA Noderate Faction now swells with many former PAC members. Led by Gu Mengyu and Pan Yuanchao, they with the support of figures such as Zhu Jiqing and Lin Bosheng have pushed for avoiding class-conflict and reconciliation within the party. Moreover, some have even gone so far as to suggest reaching out to the non-socialist left.\n\nWithin the League of Chinese Syndicalists, the Chinese Syndicalist Party has emerged dominant now that the World Society has been rendered irrelevant. The radicals in the party have seen an upswing, growing as close as ever with Chen Gongbo's faction. It is clear that inside and outside the Kuomintang, China marches to the Chairman's tune - and he is free at last to remake the nation as he sees fit."
CHI.lategame.290.a: "Now to divide up the spoils..."

CHI.lategame.291.t: "Rebellion Flares in Fujian"
CHI.lategame.291.d: "Word has reached [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] that the Kuomintang has been torn apart by their divisions over Wang Jingwei's Chairmanship, in part due to his handling of the Kuomintang-Federalist alliance. After a failed attempt to impeach him, dissident forces led by the Kuomintang's military hardliners have organised a rebellion from their old Jiangxi-Fujian strongholds. Opposition figures led by Song Qingling have gathered in Wuhan hoping to overthrow Wang, but it seems like their moment has passed.\n\nWang's situation is still precarious however, and he has sought to stabilise his position by reaching out to us. Ever the artful politician, he has sought to spin the situation as a positive - \"proof\" in his words that the majority of the party are willing to set aside our past differences. He argues that the Kuomintang have held up their end of the bargain thusfar, and it is now time for us to accept the integration of our movement. The elimination of his political rivals now smoothen the way for a lasting political accord.\n\nWang has been blessed with a silver tongue, but the sincerity of his offer is questionable. The Kuomintang does seem to be willing to engage in limited democratisation for the duration of their \"political tutelage\", and Wang has expressed some sinecere amenability to Federalist principles. However, if we agree to lay down our arms as the Kuomintang finish tearing each other apart there is no going back - if we would like to topple the party-state now is the time to do it."
CHI.lategame.291.a: "It is time we uprise in turn!"
CHI.lategame.291.b: "We will work for a better tommorrow!"

CHI.lategame.292.t: "The Federalist Compromise"
CHI.lategame.292.d: "With Wuhan having fallen, Chairman Wang had turned to another pressing matter at hand - perhaps the greatest contributor to the woes he has faced. Wang Jingwei was the broker of an alliance between the Kuomintang and the Federalists, healing a decades-long rift between the factions. This has contributed headache after headache, as various hardliners and others denounced any accord with the people who betrayed the Eternal Premier. Meanwhile the Federalists, ever distrustful, continued to maintain their functional autonomy, a constant danger for the revolution.\n\nBut at last, Wang's efforts have finally bore fruit. After an impassioned appeal, the leading Federalist outpost in [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to surrender their arms and begin the process of fully integrating themselves into the Kuomintang's state apparatus. Combined with the destruction of the Provisional Action Committee and their WMARCA puppet-masters, the true healing of the nation can finally begin under a joint republican banner - on the esteemed Chairman's terms."
CHI.lategame.292.a: "The future shines bright for the heirs of Xinhai."

CHI.lategame.293.t: "Rebellion Breaks Out in Fujian!"
CHI.lategame.293.d: "Word has reached [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] that the leftist dominated Central Executive Committee has been torn apart by their divisions over Wang Jingwei's Chairmanship. After a failed attempt to impeach him, dissident forces have organised a rebellion from their old Jiangxi-Fujian strongholds. Opposition figures led by Song Qingling have gathered in Wuhan hoping to overthrow Wang, but it seems like their moment has passed. Unfortunately, many of those who are going down with the sinking ship include plenty of our former National Revolutionary Comrades who once vouched for us, leaving this our intra-Kuomintang alliance in jeapordy.\n\nWang's situation is still precarious however, and if there was ever a time for us to make a play for power it is now. A well planned, efficiently executed strike will allow us to sweep away all the warring socialist factions, bringing a proper nationalist order to China free of French subversion. Still, with Wang's power having been steadily consolidating since he returned to China, toppling him is a tall order. We have received instructions to assit him in mopping up opposition rebels, and there is a faint hope that agreeing will allow us to maintain some semblance of influence as a satellite in his orbit."
CHI.lategame.293.a: "The Leftists have proven themselves unfit to rule."
CHI.lategame.293.b: "We must maintain order to preserve the nation."

CHI.lategame.294.t: "The Rightists Toe the Line"
CHI.lategame.294.d: "With Wuhan having fallen, Chairman Wang gave a strict, unambiguous set of orders to all governors and military commanders across the nation - bring the rebels to heel or be cast out. This action, meant to bring a definitive end to the warlord era of constantly shifting alliances and playing both sides, seems to have gotten its messsage across.\n\n[FROM.Getleader], the apparent leader of the old rightist Kuomintang splinter government, has accede to Wang's demands and disarmed any WMARCA militias in his territory, arresting PAC aligned opposition figures in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Our relations, long frosty, are not expected to significantly improve because of this, however their wise decision to bend the knee will likely ensure a quick stabilisation.\n\nThe primary beneficiaries of this decision seem to be the Moderates in the RCA, their anti-class-struggle standpoint being validated by the reunification of the party on relatively peaceful terms. The Reconstruction Faction is expected to also receive a boost, however with their power waning rapidly it is doubtful they will be around to use it."
CHI.lategame.294.a: "Order prevails."

#Scenario 2: Wang is Impeached (300-349)
CHI.lategame.300.t: "Wang is ousted from power!"
CHI.lategame.300.d: "Wang strode up to the podium and came out swinging. He knew his enemies were up to something, and was ready for a fight. With considerable gusto and well practiced eloquence he began the speech of his lifetime before a room of over a thousand comrades. And yet, as he spoke, even a veteran politician like Wang could not avoid stumbling as he looked around the room.\n\nThe sheer hatred and antipathy in the eyes of so many of the delegates was a frightening sight, their withering glares betraying angry souls. They had already made up their minds long before the Congress. His time was up as Chairman, and he knew it. All he could do now was bow out with grace, saving what little dignity he had left.\n\nHe ended his speech quietly, thanking the audience for being his comrades of so many years, leaving the stage crestfallen. In the vote that came, he stood stoic and solemn as the delegates moved to convict. By a thin, but decisive margin, the Kuomintang's decades-long Chairman was deposed by the opposition.\n\nThe stunned room moved quietly and mechanically as a successor was chosen. Song Qingling was nominated and ran uncontestedly. By the next morning, Song Qingling was sworn in as President and China had a new leader at its helm. In one swift, coordinated move the PAC gambit proved to be a success, the RCA reeling too hard to do anything to stop them. Yet."
CHI.lategame.300.a: "The tyrant falls!"

CHI.lategame.301.t: "The Rising Backlash"
CHI.lategame.301.d: "In the days that followed, an eerie calm fell over Nanjing. A quiet before the gathering storm. Wang Jingwei and his wife retreated to their private residence and have not been heard from since. The word on the street is the former Chairman has fallen into a deep depression, feeling betrayed by the party he had sacrificed so much for, and has hardly been rouseable from bed.\n\nHis allies however, have not been so meek. Chen Gongbo and others are determined: the RCA will not go down without a fight. They have taken to the airwaves, denouncing the events at the Third Repatriated Congress as an armed coup. RCA member after RCA member testify on RCA aligned radio channels and newspapers of being intimidated into voting for impeachment. Sordid rumours of an affair between Deng Yanda and the new President have spread, and her opponents have accused her of being a puppet for the military.\n\nAlready, the Executive Yuan has received a series of resignations by Wang appointees, crippling the bureaucracy. In the military and across the bureaucracy, officers have openly flouted commands by the new leadership, defying orders from Li Jishen, who has been entrusted by Song as War Minister - one of the few appointees she has made so far. The senior leadership of the CSP have waffled in face of the latest drama, but many of the radicals have begun organising wildcat strikes along with RCA-aligned unions as chaos engulfs the country."
CHI.lategame.301.a: "An undue escalation."

CHI.lategame.302.t: "The RCA Strikes Back!"
CHI.lategame.302.d: "Outside the Presidential Palace, the sounds of protests have only gotten worse over the last few days as the RCA and CSP-Radicals have agitated against the new government. Riots have broken out in cities across the country, fanned on by a heavy-handed response by security forces. The hooligans in the CRS have only made things worse by sending thugs to attack strikers and kidnapping targets they deem \"enemies of the state\".\n\nSong Qingling never wanted this. An idealist at heart, she insisted on going the \"legal\" route to end Wang's tyranny - the only way, she believed, that a peaceful transition of power could be achieved. In any case, there should have been far more time, she had hardly been given a chance to govern. She has yet to assemble much of a cabinet, or even select a Premier as talks continue between the major factions that made up the anti-Wang coalition.\n\nWith the situation far from settling down (if anything, things have gotten worse over the last few days), it seems like China's new President faces a daunting challenge to her authority. The end of the Third Congress it seems will not be the end of the conflict roiling the party-state."
CHI.lategame.302.a: "This was not part of the plan!"

CHI.lategame.303.t: "The Coalition Wavers"
CHI.lategame.303.d: "As the situation worsens, and a resolution remains elusive, cracks have emerged between the victorious factions that ousted Wang Jingwei. Shocking reports of violence and persistent disagreements between the governing coalition has given CSP leadership and many RCA-Moderates who defected from Wang's camp cold feet. The members of the World Society, who appear to be the most loyal to the PAC's coalition, have also expressed concern about the authoritarian measures used to suppress the protests even as the government ails.\n\nThe incorrigible Reconstruction Faction are exploiting the moment, with Sun Fo aggressively pushing for the end of tutelage and the holding of new elections. In his words, the only way to resolve the persistent disagreements within the party is to hold a national vote - as if that was not the point of the Third Congress. He and his affiliates have already been seen courting intellectuals and various centre-right republicans, working to corner the non-socialist vote.\n\nThe general consensus within the CEC is that Sun is delusional if he thinks the government would survive long enough at this rate to hold elections. Every day the situation seems to get worse and worse, and sooner or later enough party members will defect back to the RCA camp to beg Wang to return to power. Meanwhile the government remains paralysed by infighting, unable to present a united vision. Worse yet, War Minister Li Jishen has not been seen since yesterday - at a time when the country needs him most."
CHI.lategame.303.a: "Where is General Li?"

CHI.lategame.304.t: "The Breaking Point"
CHI.lategame.304.d: "Tragic news has reached the Central Executive Committee as War Minister Li Jishen was found dead by a patrol, having been kidnapped and murdered by extremists. After over two weeks of unabating instability, this was the last straw. Strong-arming the rest of the CEC, Song Qingling has appointed Deng Yanda as the new Command-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army, ordering him to take command of the Military Affairs Commission.\n\nIn rapid succession, arrest warrants have been issued for Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, Zhou Enlai, the Gu brothers, and other RCA grandees for sedition. Warned in advance by remaining loyalists in the Executive Yuan, almost all named targets have fled the capital, southwards to loyalist strongholds in Hangzhou. With the help of Mei Siping, Governor of Zhejiang, and sympathisers in the army, they have launched a desperate rebellion. Garrisons across the Five Provinces have reported conflicting orders and outright mutinies, while others weigh their options. For the most however, the army establishment has remained firmly in Song's camp.\n\nWhile in public the PAC's coalition partners have closed ranks behind President Song and her champion, behind closed doors they have made their resentment clear. They have demanded Song honour her promises of being a much less authoritarian leader than Wang, helping form a consensus rather than rule by fiat. On the other hand, many members of the WMARCA have called for decisive action, and the Central Affairs Commission has offered to lend a helping hand in \"bypassing\" partisan bickering if helps stabiise the country. With the prospect of civil war looming, Song Qingling narrows on a decision."

#We need a Unity Government (310-319)
CHI.lategame.310.t: "The Emergency Coalition"
CHI.lategame.310.d: "In every unity government, there is often a lot of yapping and the new CEC is little different. Sun Fo and his Reconstruction Faction allies whine about socialist excesses and hawk constitutionalist principles as it suits them. Gu Mengyu, Pan Yuanchao and the other RCA-Moderates struggle to find their bearing in a changing republic, seen as traitors to Wang's camp and flip-flopping on major issues to compensate. Meanwhile the League of Chinese Syndicalists remain hopelessly divided, with the Chen Duxiu-Li Lisan based Orthodox Faction of the Chinese Syndicalist party desperately fighting to control their own party. All the Elders in the World Society seem compatible enough but often find themselves in their own world, high atop their ivory tower.\n\nThe PAC's control of the military has given them a major source of leverage, forcing these disparate factions to the negotiating table. The infighting within the party has long been detrimental to the war effort, and Song Qingling is unwilling to make the same mistake. Still, the civilians of the PAC such as Zhang Bojun and Peng Zexiang have begged her to reach out to their allies, placating at least some of their concerns. Although plenty of it is smoke, there are some valid questions of why we did what we did and whether or not the RCA's accusations against us have any weight. The diplomatic Chen Youren, party elder Peng Zemin, and her brother Song Ziwen have all offered to mediate in talks.\n\nUltimately, however, it is up to Song Qingling to demonstrate her leadership. She recognises that many joined the opposition to Wang's rule for different reasons. Many hated his authoritarian style of rule, and feared a party-dictatorship under the RCA. Others resented the RCA's corruption, their tendency to twist major institutions to further their own (often personal) ends. As she works to win over her erstwhile allies, she reminds them why they fight."
CHI.lategame.310.a: "Stress the fight against tyranny!"
CHI.lategame.310.b: "Stress the fight against corruption!"

CHI.lategame.311.t: "The End of the Rebellion"
CHI.lategame.311.d: "The fight against Wang loyalist forces was hard fought but brief. Under Deng Yanda and Huang Qixiang's brilliant leadership, rebelling National Revolutionary Army units were cordoned off and surrounded before they could unite into a cohesive fighting force. The rest were herded into untenable strongholds, besieged by considerably larger PAC-aligned armies.\n\nThe rebellion had hoped that there would be a great uprising of Political Department cliqued oriented divisions, MMIC trained \"Young Guard\" unit, and independent-minded officers willing to fight back against the new government's overreach. But the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association held firm, and Deng Yanda ensured the bulk of the army remained loyal to Song's forces.\n\nWith Hangzhou and a few other cities surrounded, and with little relief in sight, one by one they were forced to surrender. Unwilling to bear a siege and fearful the PAC would begin shelling the city soon, Wang overruled his lieutenants and ordered his allies to lay down their arms rather than go down in a fiery last stand. Before the city fell, Chen Gongbo, Chen Shaoyu, and other affiliated radicals took the last few tickets out of the country. The fleet has tacitly allowed them to depart unmolested.\n\nThe next time a CEC delegation saw Wang and his wife, the former Chairman looked haggard. He spoke politely, even to Song (though avoided making eye-contact), but seemed to resigned to his fate. The broken man inspired pity from some of his old comrades, particularly Gu Mengyu's faction, who have joined with Chen Bijun to plea for charity on his behalf. They recommend we use his international celebrity to send him overseas to live out his days in exile. Others however insist this is a ploy by an experienced snake, and demand he be brought to justice once and for all."

#Enact Emergency Powers (320-329)
CHI.lategame.320.t: "The Fall of the Chairman"
CHI.lategame.320.d: "Somber was the mood in the Legislative Yuan as the grim bill made its rounds. There was some expectation of resistance, particularly from the RF and LCS, but ultimately little came of it besides an outspoken hot-head or two. Ultimately the alliance that claimed to be fighting for freedom was reduced to a resigned silence as it was debated and voted on, grinding their teeth but providing a unanimous vote.\n\nWith its passage, a state of emergency has been declared over four provinces (Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Hubei) believed to have entrenched RCA or CSP-Radical support bases. The Military Affairs Commission led by Deng Yanda was given a wide-latitude to enforce order for the duration of the emergency and add smaller subdivisions to the list as they deem appropriate. The emergency was to last for three years, with the possibility of extension, but the \"Red Napoleon\" took less than three weeks.\n\nWith often great violence, rebelling strongholds were stormed by National Revolution Army units - blasting away hastility erected fortifications with artillery. Retribution was often swift and severe, with paramilitaries going door-to-door to arrest suspected RCA sympathisers and CSP-Radicals. Disappearances and gruesome stories have made their way to the press, outpacing our censors' ability to stop them, giving Deng a reputation as a butcher. In the chaos, it has been reported that RCA affiliates Shi Cuntong and Zhou Enlai have perished in the onslaught.\n\nAlthough much of the barbarity can be attested to CRS militias, given the sheer scale of the campaign the WMARCA can hardly escape blame either. In an event no censor could hide, Wang Jingwei was captured and executed, his body left in a public square before more senior personnel could stop it.\n\nThe ferocious violence has severely shaken Chinese society to its core. Some of her advisors have begged that martial law be lifted and for the militias to be reigned in before they can do further harm, while others demand we remain vigilant as reports of gunfire continues. Song Qingling, who had banked her crediblity backing this plan, is expected to say something about her predecssor's demise to a terrified nation."
CHI.lategame.320.a: "A tragic end and horrible mistake."
CHI.lategame.320.b: "A fitting end for a traitor."

CHI.lategame.321.t: "A Day in Court"
CHI.lategame.321.d: "After Wang's death, orders were handed down to ensure none of the other \"big names\" in his government be harmed. Most surrendered peacefully or were otherwise captured (largely) unscathed, and were quickly placed under careful security detail by trusted units in Nanjing. A hurried trial was scheduled, unsuccessfully hoping to avoid media scrutiny.\n\nLeading figures of Wang's regime faced the court, with their legal teams scrambling to defend them from charges of sedition. The prosecution has elected to throw in charges of impropriety and misrule from even before Wang's ouster, hoping to delegitimise his reign from the beginning. Chen Gongbo was unrepentent, defending his and Wang's actions vigorously. Chen Bijun likewise defended her husband, refusing an offer for clemency in exchange for admitting guilt. Zeng Zhongming and Chu Minyi remained mostly quiet, though occasionally took their chances to mess with the prosecution.\n\nLower level figures, whose convictions were far less of a guarantee, were less staunch in their defence. General Zhang Zhizhong claimed he and his men were following orders, and that the constitutional chain of command was questionable given that Wang was only impeached from Chairmanship of the party rather than the Presidency.  Other figures such as Zhou Fohai and Li Shiqun asked for clemency turning on their fellow defendents.\n\nThe trial has been heavily politicised, perhaps inevitably, though many have accused it of being a show-trial. The Moderates in the RCA have begged for some leniency here, though with thousands now dead someone needs to take the blame."
CHI.lategame.321.a: "Commute their sentences."
CHI.lategame.321.b: "Throw the book at them!"

#Scenario 2 Wrapup (340-349)
CHI.lategame.340.t: "Action Seizes the Day!"
CHI.lategame.340.d: "In the end, the Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang is provisional no more. Having toppled the tyrannical Wang Jingwei, Song Qingling and her allies now stand as masters of a reforged China's fate. They have begun the rebranding process, calling themselves the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang in an effort to assert themselves as the legitimate heirs of the party.\n\nThe fallout of the Third Repatriated Congress has not been pretty at all. The political landscape is rapidly changing as people adapt to the new leadership and the power-vacuum that has emerged with the RCA's collapse. Many of the factions that had aligned with the PAC are not happy about the way the WMARCA flexed their military muscle, and their commitment to the Revolutionary Committee is wavering.\n\nDeng Yanda has emerged as an object of scorn for many within the party, jealous or fearful of his seemly assured status as the second most powerful figure in the nation. Other, more junior ranked members of the PAC have been rewarded with prominent posts in the new RC-KMT dominated government. Of the military wing, Huang Qixiang, Zhang Yunchuan, and Guo Guanjie have been the most prominent. Of the civilian wing, Zhang Bojun, Peng Zexiang, Chen Youren, He Xiangning, and Peng Zemin now work to harness the PAC's legislative arm. Minor figures such as Li Xiju, Li Shihao, and Tao Xisheng find themselves in positions of power, and Song has also sought the counsel of her brother Song Ziwen and brother-in-law Kong Xiangxi (H.H. Kung) in administrative affairs."
CHI.lategame.340.a: "But the day's not over yet..."

CHI.lategame.341.t: "Wang Jingwei Deposed in Nanjing!"
CHI.lategame.341.d: "In the latest evidence of turmoil within China's supposedly victorious Kuomintang party-state, it seems that Wang Jingwei has been impeached by members of his own party. In his place, Song Qingling had been hurrily sworn in with the backing of the opposition, a move which was decried as a military coup d'etat by the loyalists of the downed Chairman. Violence has only escalated as security forces harshly crack down on anti-government protests, and the nation has been thrown into chaos.\n\nIt matters little who is at fault when the entire system of oppression is the cause of this strife. It is clear that the much touted \"stability\" the party's dictatorship claims to provide is but a myth - an excuse to keep others out of discussion while their leaders slaughter one another for power. Song Qingling and her clique have long taken a hard line against the Federalist movement, often out of personal animosity. And although Wang and his ilk claim to be the \"architects\" of our recent Kuomintang-Federalist accords, it is plain to see that those deals were nothing more than a means of consolidating power around himself.\n\nThere is little time to spare then if we wish to ensure a genuine democracy can take hold in China. We must march now while the Kuomintang is weak to overthrow Nanjing, rallying whatever factions are left in the nation against the vile party-state. There will be risks of course, and some of the more liberal factions of the anti-Wang opposition led by Sun Fo have tried to extend an olive branch of their own, saying that if we throw our lot with them they will ensure the worst excesses of socialist dictatorship will be avoided. But it is hard to take that at face value when the entire corrupt system that Kuomintang's \"Republic\" has built can only foster further tyranny in the future."
CHI.lategame.341.a: "The Kuomintang have proven themselves unfit to rule."
CHI.lategame.341.b: "We must put our faith in a democratic outcome."

CHI.lategame.342.t: "The Federalists Align With Sun Fo"
CHI.lategame.342.d: "Perhaps cowed by our superior might or perhaps because their followers are too exhausted from war to continue, in any case there have been little movement from the forces of [FROM.GetNameDef] even as our recent bout of instability offers ample opportunity for the Federalists to strike. [FROM.GetLeader] has quietly offered his congratulations to President Song on her election, tacitly accepting the status quo in hopes of preserving the Kuomintang-Federalist accords brokered by her predecssor and the Reconstruction Faction.\n\nWhether or not history will remember this as the correct decision remains to be seen. Song and the PAC have long railed against negotiations with the Federalists, and the alliance remains in peril. Further integration of Federalist aligned provinces may very well spark a broader conflict in the near future, but it seems that the [FROM.GetLeader] has shifted towards a more pacifistic tract.\n\nInstead of revolting while the Kuomintang is distracted by internal conflict, he has thrown his lot with Sun Fo and the liberals of the Reconstruction Faction, hoping that Federalist resources will buffer what might now be the leading alternative to Song and Wang's rule. The future is uncertain for liberal democracy in the nation, but the end is not yet."
CHI.lategame.342.a: "At least there will be no violence."

CHI.lategame.343.t: "Victory of the Opposition!"
CHI.lategame.343.d: "In the latest twist in our party's history, the long-time leftist Chairman Wang Jingwei has been impeached at a national party congress, the victim of overlapping political machinations of a disparate opposition united only in their hatred of him. Song Qingling, the widow of the party's founder, had been hurrily installed in his place by the plotters, a move opposed by the ousted Chairman's remaining loyalists. As accusations flew of a coup and violence escalated, a harsh crackdown against Wang's RCA ensued.\n\nAs the nation lurches into yet another bout of instability, the new President of the Republic has hurried to try and secure support for her fledging government. This included contacting [ROOT.GetLeader] through both direct telegrams and various intermediaries, hoping to line up our support. In addition to bribes and threats, they have also sought to guilt us - saying that we owe them for our \"successful\" merger of the party and using our mutual contacts in the military to ramp up pressure upon us.\n\nPolitical grandstanding aside, the party's centre-right has sought to enlist our support, eyeing a future for the party stripped of the socialist corruption that has plagued it for decades. They have put their weight behind Sun Fo, and have encouraged us to do the same, hoping to rally a broad rightist bloc to oppose further damage wrought upon the nation by the reckless left. With an evident power-vacuum growing..."

CHI.lategame.344.t: "The Kuomintang Schism Healed"
CHI.lategame.344.d: "Victory is often a magnet. Despite all the divisions and rifts, the Kuomintang's various splinters have coalesced under one government, perhaps attracted by the power at stake. The opposition against Wang, already wide and unwieldy, has gained another ally with the long-delayed absorption of the [FROM.GetAdjective]-based rightist central committee into their post-Wang government.\n\nThis has buoyed Sun Fo and his allies' political chances, strengthening his bid to assemble a broad rightist coalition within the party to advance his dreams of the chairmanship. It has also drawn in plenty of rightists and militarists, long a scourge of the party, which threatens the integrity of the party-state as a whole.\n\nThis final fulfillment of party unification, while far from perfect, more optimistically can be seen as proof of the enduring power of Sun Yat-sen's principles to call a nation together. It remains to be seen whether or not this unity will bring about positive political change, or simply entrench existing divisions that will have to be relitigated ad nauseam, but the Kuomintang are now one - at least for now."
CHI.lategame.344.a: "But will this bring order?"

##Scenario 3: The Bad Ending (350-399)
CHI.lategame.350.t: "Chaos on the Convention Floor"
CHI.lategame.350.d: "Wang stepped forward towards the podium, undeterred by the jeers and curses of those around him. Braving a fusillade of slander and accusations of tyranny, he began his speech, hoping to reassert control over the situation. Many of his allies were shouting back, hoping to drown out the hecklers.\n\nWang was an experienced politician, but even this was too much - particularly a repeated charge by the crowd that he had orchestrated the assassination of various political opponents to rise to the top. His speech, elegant in his mind and initially delivered with practiced eloquence soon turned into an unhinged rant, dooming the convention. He rebuked his opponents, screaming of the presence of counter-revolutionary traitors in their midst.\n\nOne by one, members of the congress were called for a roll-call vote. By just four votes, Wang escaped impeachment as Chairman by the party, though the PAC have made it clear they intend to press their case in the Control Yuan to remove him as President. Ultimately, such constitutional niceties drew far less attention than when the ensuing vote for the next Party Chairman devolved into a fist-fight by delegates as the election became contested by Wang Jingwei, Song Qingling and last minute candidate Sun Fo.\n\nWasting little time, Wang decided as incumbent Chairman of the party to suspend elections and quash the proceedings, arguing that the violence made a fair vote untenable. He has announced a preliminary cabinent, with Chen Gongbo was his Vice Chairman of the CEC and Sun Fo as his Premier of the Executive Yuan.\n\nFeeling betrayed by the Reconstruction Faction, who appear to have lost faith in the opposition alliance, Song Qingling and her allies have walked out of Congress rather than confirm such an undemocratic measure. Fearing they will be arrested to ensure quorum (and a favourable vote for Wang), they have fled the capital."
CHI.lategame.350.a: "Can this get any worse?"

CHI.lategame.351.t: "The Fujian Government"
CHI.lategame.351.d: "In the latest development of intra-party factionalism, a rival government has been established in the south. Led by Song Qingling and the Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang, they have declared Wang's rule illegitimate and contrary to the principles set forth by Sun Yat-sen. Various dissidents have gathered there as they work to form their own central committee rival to Nanjing. Most troubling is the defection of War Minister Li Jishen to their cause, fueling further fears of military betrayal.\n\nIt is clear by this point that there will be no return to the status quo, and neither side has any intention of tolerating another ineffectual power-sharing agreement. The Kuomintang stands divided, and garrisons around the country are weighing their options as they figure out which side to back.\n\nBack in Nanjing, the Reconstruction Faction have driven a hard bargain in exchange for their support. They have secured as collateral Sun Fo as Premier, which they believe will give them control over the Executive Yuan. They have pressed for further reforms in legislature, reconstruction, and constitutional matters.\n\nThe incumbent President Wang Jingwei could hardly focus on their petty politicking however. The experience at the Third Congress has shakened the man, laying bare his sheer unpopularity. Against the advice of Chen Gongbo, he is determined to personally go south to Fujian as a sign of good will - claiming he has the negotiating experience to broker a truce before the situation grows out of control.\n\nOthers, however, suspect that his true intentions are to shore up his support in southern coastal cities like Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and Xiamen. They accuse him of reaching out to RCA and radical CSP militias to reinforce his power-base in preparation for a self-coup. Whatever the case, the four armoured cars of the Presidential motorcade left Nanjing this morning, heading southwards."
CHI.lategame.351.a: "Safe travels President Wang."

CHI.lategame.352.t: "The Cycle of Death"
CHI.lategame.352.d: "Wang Jingwei never made it to Fujian. Instead his motorcade was found on a winding Zhejiang road about four kilometers from the nearest town, the corpses of guards and attendants littering the path. The President and his wife were slumped over in their car and their arrogant head of security Li Shiqun also among the slain. Wang is the latest casualty in China's cycle of death, a perpetrator and victim in the nation's bloodletting. The Kuomintang may have brought order in their unification, but they have not brought peace.\n\nNo one quite knows who ordered the ambush. The specific path was supposed to be kept secret and despite promises of safety for a parley, Wang brought along heavy-armed security. At this point, no one cares. The forces in MinGan continued to gather in strength, pulling in defecting army units and sympathetic governors. Deng Yanda, who has been appointed commander of the rebel ground forces, has marched northwards with the bulk of his army to Nanchang - seizing the Jiangxi provincial capital.\n\nIn Nanjing, the central government could hardly contain the mayhem breaking out among the lower ranks. Chen Gongbo, as Vice Chairman of the Party, has moved to assume the duties of Chairman of the Kuomintang and President of the Republic. Sun Fo has contested his bid, arguing that as Premier of the Executive Yuan he would be the constitutional successor. Annoyed, Chen agreed to put it up for a vote.\n\nTo his surprise, the vote was deadlocked. The Reconstruction Faction should have been outnumbered, but nonetheless marched in lockstep. The Residence Faction, now decapitated with Chen Bijun's death and in total disarray, refused to commit to Chen's leadership - instead deciding to back Chu Minyi. Plenty of RCA-Moderates are also reeling from the news of Wang's death, and have expressed concern that Chen is too radical to defuse tensions in the party. Nanjing has been paralysed!"
CHI.lategame.352.a: "A complete disaster!"

CHI.lategame.353.t: "Chen Gongbo Overplays His Hand"
CHI.lategame.353.d: "The nightmare just keeps refusing to cease. Every time Chen Gongbo seems to be making progress with Chu Minyi and Zeng Zhongming, something comes up and they pull back. Meanwhile Sun Fo has been making gains among the RCA-Moderates, while dangling the possibility of a peace commission. All the while, the army of Deng Yanda has continued to slowly make gains, rendering these discussions moot. Without Wang Jingwei, his coalition of supporters has fallen apart and Chen has reached his wits' end trying to piece it back together.\n\nSo he tried a different track. In the dead of night, Chen has reached out to leading military officers such as Zhang Zhizhong and Zhou Enlai, hoping to use the military to force things back on track. Besides Zhou's so-called Political Department Clique, Chen has also tapped into the ranks of MMIC trained syndicalist officers such as Xiao Jinguang. Combined he believed this \"Young Guard\" would be sufficient to turn the tide. Moreover, he has made contact with the increasingly resentful urban trade unionists, both RCA affiliated as well as those aligned with Chen Shaoyu and the radicals of the CSP. If push comes to shove, mass strikes will sweep him into power.\n\nUnfortunately for him, he was outplayed. His messages have long been monitored by agents of Dai Chunfeng and his scheme was promptly exposed. General Hu Zongnan, a rival for control of the \"Young Guard\", presented the evidence before the Central Executive Committee as a \"loyal servant of the revolution\". Chen was promptly denounced as a subversive and expelled from the party, though through some personal cunning he avoided attending the CEC meeting.\n\nHis Residence Faction and RCA-Moderate peers were often not so lucky - Chu Minyi was arrested and thousands of others swept up by the secret police. The savvier elements of the RCA who managed to escape have fled Nanjing, utterly routed."

CHI.lategame.354.d: "Always be careful for what you wish for. That is a lesson that acting President Sun Fo has learned all too well, having finally taken the helm of his father's party but at its darkest hour. Reports have emerged that Deng Yanda and the armies of the PAC have elected to turn west, striking at Wuhan and Changsha first before making a move on the heavily fortified Nanjing.\n\nChen Gongbo has shocked some by going north rather than the RCA's traditional strongholds in the south. With little time to waste, he made his way to [GetVictoryPointName_9843], taking advantage of RCA influence over appointments in freshly conquered territories to scrape together a powerbase. With the help of General Zhang Zhizhong, they have convinced most northern garrisons to side with them or at least remain neutral for the time being.\n\nAll the while, Nanjing remains effectively rudderless. Sun's most trusted officers, Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue have struggled to gain a handle on the situation and the latter has left Nanjing to take command of the Wuhan garrison. Most of the intellectual and business support the Reconstruction Faction has counted on could provide little but words in support and the situation grows more and more precarious with each passing week.\n\nSun Fo and his tight circle of advisors were in a bind until they finally caught a lucky break: quiet talks through intermediaries finally came through. An advanced delegation including Song Ziwen, Chen Youren, and the \"Four Elders\" have offered to broker negotiations between Nanjing and Fujian, ending the strife.\n\nBut Sun Fo's camp are hardly the only ones holding the cards in Nanjing. The revolution has grown heavily radicalised, and China Revival Society army officers have called for extreme measures to end the chaos once and for all. In a meeting, Generals Hu Zongnan, He Zhonghan, and Deng Wenyi have presented a proposal to Sun advising the acting President to declare martial law. They argue treason only has one punishment, and have offered to carry out anything necessary to save the nation."

#Alignment Events (360-369)
CHI.lategame.360.t: "The Kuomintang Civil War!"
CHI.lategame.360.intro: "After a rancorous Third Repatriated Congress, the seemingly victorious Kuomintang national government have divided into warring factions. President Wang Jingwei has been killed by unknown assailants, and in the chaos, competing Central Executive Committees have been established in Nanjing, Fujian, and [GetVictoryPointName_9843].\n\nNanjing is where a rump central government has lingered on, now with Sun Fo at the helm. His wavering government is being sundered with dysfunction and rumours of a coup by the China Revival Society have swirled. To the south, Song Qingling and her Provisional Action Committee (PAC) of the Kuomintang have reactivated their old insurgency bases to challenge what they call tyranny. She has received extensive support by many old-guard members of the military, often veteran guerilla commanders. To the north, Chen Gongbo has rallied many former Wang loyalists, declaring their government in [GetVictoryPointName_9843] the rightful one for the nation. With the support of many radicals, they nonetheless are running short on time before local garrisons turn on them."
CHI.lategame.360.d.1: "$CHI.lategame.360.intro$\n\nAcross the nation, governors and military commanders are weighing their options. Many are taking their time before choosing a side, waiting to see who appears stronger before making a move. Representatives from each rival government have begged us for our support and as one of the more autonomous governorates our backing might just be pivotal. Of course, with the Kuomintang as weak as ever, this might be our chance to present our own case for autonomy, or even dreams of national leadership!"

CHI_lategame_civ_war_alignment_intro: "As word of a looming civil war spreads across the nation, leaders from the distant provinces have been forced to make a choice. Many have done so reluctantly, facing potential rebellion from their ranks and also fearing choosing the wrong side.

CHI.lategame.364.a: "Traitors!"

CHI.lategame.365.t: "Civil War Breaks Out in China"
CHI.lategame.365.d: "This situation in China, once promising, has fallen into calamity as radicalism and stubbornness overwhelms reason. After a rancorous Third Repatriated Congress, opponents of Wang Jingwei sought his ouster. In the aftermath, conflicting reports agree that the late Chairman was assassinated by extremists, worsening the situation.\n\nIn the last few weeks, three rival governments have emerged. Nanjing is the sight of the rump central government led by the non-socialist Sun Fo, though his grip on power seems to be slipping. In the shadows behind him, a cabal of socialist military hard-liners threaten to take charge. To the south, Song Qingling and her Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang have organised a rebellion with many old MinGan insurgent commanders. To the north, Chen Gongbo and most of Wang's ex-compatriots have gathered in [GetVictoryPointName_9843] in hopes of restoring what they call the legtimate government.\n\nThe Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine represents the Internationale's foothold in the troubled nation, advisors for the old National Revolutionary Army and mentors for many cadets over the years. Leaving them in Nanjing or redeploying them elsewhere would send a strong statement. On the other hand, some have advised we withdrawl them altogether, protecting their lives and washing our hands of the situation altogether."

The forces in Nanjing could do little to stop them, hoping to avoid sparking an international incident. This was in many ways a natural choice, with many syndicalist-aligned officers feeling a natural affinity for the Reorganised Comrades Association. It has also bolstered Chen's legitimacy, with many young officers following their old mentors and teachers from the Mission north to the gathering armies of the RCA. Still, it is too early tell if this will be decisive, but in a show of strength every advantage counts."

CHI.lategame.367.d: "After hearing of the situation playing out in China, a decision was made to keep the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine in Nanjing. By staying in place, they have sent a strong signal of continuity, indicating their recognition of Nanjing as the legtimate leader of China. This decision comes as somewhat of a shocking, with [CHI.GetLeader] bracing for their likely defection. It seems the Internationale are expressing hope that we will be able to contribute to the world-wide revolution in the future, and that a peaceful resolution will emerge."
CHI.lategame.367.a: "Is that so?"

CHI.lategame.368.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Condemns Nanjing"
CHI.lategame.368.d: "After hearing of the situation playing out in China, a decision was made to withdraw the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine altogether. In doing so, the Internationale has decided to wash its hands of the situation, evacuating its personnel. Plenty of affiliated Chinese citizens have tried to flee with them, hoping to escape the worst of the situation. This was not necesarily unexpected, though plenty of \"Young Guard\" officers feel betrayed about being left to their fate. Many have fallen into the arms of the China Revival Society, who have denounced the MMIC as a form of red imperialism, and instead insisted that only Chinese can save China."
CHI.lategame.368.a: "How could they do this to us?"

CHI.lategame.369.d: "After hearing of the situation playing out in China, a decision was made to redeploy the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine to Fujian. The forces in Nanjing could do little to stop them, hoping to avoid sparking an international incident. This was unexpected, due to the history of repeated clashes between the WMARCA Old Guard and the MMIC. Still, it has been a boon for Song's legitimacy, with many young officers following their old mentors and teachers from the Mission south to the gathering armies of the PAC. Still, it is too early tell if this will be decisive, but in a show of strength every advantage counts."
CHI.lategame.369.a: "A surprise to be sure but a welcome one."

#Negotiations with the PAC Chain (370-379)
CHI.lategame.370.t: "The Garrison at Wuhan"
CHI.lategame.370.d: "The tension was palpable in Wuhan, where Nanjing-aligned forces hurrily gathered. General Xue Yue had been rushed to the scene, ordered to hurrily prepare for an assault. This vital city stands at the intersection of the Yangtze and Han rivers, the heart of Hubei and the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution. The Wuhan garrison had received reinforcements from the central government, but far from enough.\n\nJust a few kilometers southwards, the armies of Fujian encamped, awaiting instructions from home. Led by the \"Red Napoleon\" Deng Yanda, he has brought some of his elite divisions for a decisive campaign. The only thing stopping him from making his attempt are mixed communications about a potential ceasefire, and neither side seems to trust one another.\n\nTo the north, the armies of [GetVictoryPointName_9843] are on the move. Realising the weakness of their position, inheriting probably the smallest fraction of the old National Revolutionary Army, Chen Gongbo has sent his division forward in hopes of catching his opponents offguard. No one quite knows where his army is, with conflicting reports from scouts, only that they have been moving southwards.\n\nThe garrison commander at Wuhan is therefore caught in a bind. Wuhan consists of three towns. Wuchang is the largest and south of the river, threatened by the advancing PAC force from Fujian. Hankou is north of the river, potentially threatened by the RCA-aligned army from [GetVictoryPointName_9843]. Hanyang is the site of a major arsenal, sitting on the west bank, but is protected on two sides. Xue Yue's best bet is to build up fortifications and concentrate men on one side, the question is which.\n\nThere is no telling how long this apparent \"ceasefire\" with the PAC will last, and Wuchang is probably the more valuable part of the city. On the other hand, the Fujian army has dug in so far, and it's unclear how close or even the intended destination of the [GetVictoryPointName_9843] army. After deliberating with his war council, General Xue has vowed to come to a decision."
CHI.lategame.370.a: "Fortify Wuchang in case PAC talks collapse."
CHI.lategame.370.b: "Fortify Hankou in case the RCA advances."

CHI.lategame.371.t: "The Storming of Wuhan"
CHI.lategame.371.d: "Smaller, sleeker and imbued with high morale thanks to the stewardship of Zhou Enlai's Political Department, the RCA's army surpassed expectations with their southern campaign. Gathering in Baoding, they took advantage of existing rail infrastructure to move far faster than their opponents anticipated. Evading detection and utilising sympathetic counter-espionage networks to confuse enemy efforts to track their movements, the [GetVictoryPointName_9843] army under Zhang Zhizhong reached the gates of Wuhan with hardly any warning.\n\nMaking haste, they ambushed the lightly defended Hankou, catching the Nanjing army off-guard and sending the garrison into disarray. The rest of Wuhan surrendered in a rout, with little communications with the PAC-aligned Fujian army until it was too late.\n\nDeng Yanda, not wishing to sabotage on-going talks between his allies and the government in Nanjing, hestitated to make his move against Wuchang until it was clear the city had changed hands. Seeing his mistake too late, he attempted to rectify it by rousing his forces for an assault on the city's fortifications.\n\nThe advanced units of the Fujian army were brave but the PAC's forces were hopelessly overstretched - many of their units had been deployed during the ceasefire to Changsha. Their assault on the considerably more fortified Wuchang side of the city was beaten back with heavy casualties, and Deng was forced to order a retreat.\n\nBy the end of the week, Chen Gongbo entered Wuhan victorious. Delivering a speech before the city, he promised that the revolution that began in Wuchang would not be betrayed.\n\nAs he met with his generals however, the victorious army were forced to make a decision of their own. Although much closer to their traditional power-bases, their army is a long way from their headquarters in [GetVictoryPointName_9843]. On the other hand, making the arduous trek to Nanjing offers the tantalising possibility of ending the war earlier - if they were to succeed. With the high command divided between striking a potentially unprepared Nanjing or staying put in Wuhan to consolidate their position, it is up to Chen to make a final decision."
CHI.lategame.371.a: "Do not repeat the PAC's mistake."
CHI.lategame.371.b: "Onwards to liberation!"

CHI.lategame.372.t: "The Battle of Nanjing"
CHI.lategame.372.d: "Fresh off their victory in Wuhan, RCA forces were nonetheless determined to push on to seize Nanjing from its usurpers. Their advance on Wuhan had already overstreched their logistics, and even with the Yangtze river they were taking a huge gamble. A gamble which failed to pay off.\n\nThe Nanjing government, long suffering from indecision, sobered up after their loss of Wuhan. Being the Kuomintang's provisional capital since the League war, it was already a reasonably well-fortified city. The assault by the [GetVictoryPointName_9843] army was rebuffed with heavy casualties by the assembled forces in Nanjing, including a few surviving units from Wuhan that were eager to get their revenge.\n\nAfter a few determined skirmishes and a fierce counterattack by Nanjing forces, the armies of Chen Gongbo were put to flight. In a campaign across Jiangsu and Anhui, the Nanjing army gave chase, their spirits lifted. However word of instability in the capital gave their commanders pause. It seems that the contents of what is being discussed with Fujian were leaked, and plenty are not happy with the terms presented. Whereas General Hu Zongnan has advised we finish off the forces of the RCA in detail, General Zhang Fakui would prefer if hold back and wait for talks with the PAC to generate reinforcements."
CHI.lategame.372.a: "Counterattack the retreating RCA troops."
CHI.lategame.372.b: "Hold and wait for reinforcements."

CHI.lategame.373.t: "The Siege of Hankou"
CHI.lategame.373.d: "Having fortified the north, the Nanjing-aligned armies of Xue Yue were prepared just in time for the sudden arrival of the [GetVictoryPointName_9843]-aligned assault force led by Zhang Zhizhong. Although the [GetVictoryPointName_9843] army initially had the advantage, successfully ambushing the forward positions of the Wuhan garrison, as the Nanjing army fell back into their prepared positions closer to the city they were able to force a siege.\n\nHearing of the situation, Deng Yanda and his Fujian army has offered a truce (somewhat at gunpoint) to Xue Yue to fight off their mutual foes in the RCA. With some hesitation, General Xue agreed to allow Fujian forces into the city. This has allowed Nanjing forces to redeploy from Wuchang to Hankou, relieving pressure on the northern flank.\n\nUnfortunately, the joint Nanjing-Fujian command is not in as strong as a position as they would have thought. Many of Deng's troops had been redeployed under the cover of the initial ceasefire to take Changsha (which had not chosen a side yet), leaving the Fujian army somewhat of a paper-tiger. Despite this, Deng has insisted on taking overall command of the joint armies, pressing his seniority and also the greater experience of his men. This has caused some push-back, but Deng has appealed directly to his former Fourth Army comrade to trust him. In the end, the fate of the war may very well fall not on the policy makers in Nanjing and Fujian, but the soldiery in Wuhan."
CHI.lategame.373.a: "We march together to victory!"
CHI.lategame.373.b: "Infighting cripples their chances."

CHI.lategame.374.t: "The Breakout at Wuhan"
CHI.lategame.374.d: "Having united their forces, the Siege of Wuhan was broken by the joint armies of Fujian and Nanjing. Sallying forth under the cover of artillery, they pushed the  [GetVictoryPointName_9843] army back. Their opponent proved weaker than expected, having outrun their logistics during their rapid advance southwards. As a consequence, they were forced to retreat, barely keeping order as they pulled back towards Henan.\n\nThe soldiers in Wuhan were exultant as they celebrated their combined victory, and many expressed hope that their leaders would carry through in negotiations. A considerable number of officers have privately vowed that they would refuse to take arms against one another.\n\nIn their war room however, their commanders mull over their next steps. Xue Yue, an bold and sometimes impetuous officer, has insisted on following up on their victory - chasing down their routing foes while they have the opportunity. Deng Yanda however has expressed the desire to remain by the Yangtze to consolidate government control, a position that has drawn some suspicion that he intends to remain master of Wuhan. With their point largely proven now that Chen Gongbo's minions have been put to flight, there is some validity in what Deng has to say - surely most remaining undecided garrisons will side with the government. If, of course, an agreement comes about."
CHI.lategame.374.a: "Chase after the RCA"
CHI.lategame.374.b: "Caution is wise in these times."

CHI.lategame.375.t: "The Battle Along the Coastline"
CHI.lategame.375.d: "The fleets of China have long consisted of bickering cliques, largely independent of the Kuomintang. Even as governments change and leaders come and go, it always seems like the faces in the admiralty stay the same. Despite their numerous feuds, it appears the Republic of China Navy has largely remained a cohesive (if still internally divided) entity, aloof from the civil war on land.\n\nThis might soon be challenged by the latest scheme cooked up by Chen Gongbo to give him an advantage in the war. With the help of some contacts in South East Asia and the Internationale, he has sought to secure key aid shipments from various allies to his capital.\n\nAdmiral Chen Shaokuan has been ordered by Sun Fo to stop him, but the number of seaworthy ships in the Nanjing fleet remains limited and the Kuomintang are experienced blockade runners. Moreover, reports of bribery and some genuine sympathy with  [GetVictoryPointName_9843] have hampered the effectiveness of the fleet. Many wonder if the admiralty are truly up to the task."
CHI.lategame.375.a: "The blockade runners slip by!"
CHI.lategame.375.b: "The shipments are captured!"

CHI.lategame.376.t: "Unrest in Nanjing"
CHI.lategame.376.d: "The talks between Sun Fo's government in Nanjing and Song Qingling's government in Fujian have long been secretive and the source of speculation. Their unwillingness to divulge much information to the public or even prominent members of the government has been a source of ire for many in the Nanjing army, who fear that they are being sold out. Many of the rumours coming out of the talks however seem to suggest that they are inching towards a settlement more favourable to Fujian, hearsay often fanned by agents of Dai Chunfeng who is believed to be keeping close watch over the proceedings.\n\nIn the seedy underbelly of the city, away from the distracted eyes of negotiators, conspirators have been making deals of their own. In a last ditch attempt to get their way, military hard-liners have made their play for power by attempting to kidnap Sun Fo, seizing the acting President and scuttling negotiations.\n\nA dawn a series of rioting broke out against \"bourgeoisie\" elements, spurred on by various rumours of foreign mercenaries being present in the city, supposedly hired by the Overseas Chinese Commission. The overwhelmed police struggled to contain the mobs, which often included well-armed paramilitaries affiliated with the China Revival Society.\n\nSun Fo was forced to end negotiations early for the day and be evacuated by his bodyguard. As his entourage struggles to navigate the city to a fortified safe-house, CRS strike-teams prowl the streets searching for him. The city has been thrown into chaos, and control see-saws between factions. By sunset..."
CHI.lategame.376.a: "...he reaches his bunker safely."
CHI.lategame.376.b: "...the CRS takes control!"

#Declare Martial Law Chain (380-389)
CHI.lategame.380.t: "Martial Law Declared"
CHI.lategame.380.d: "Sun Fo knew he was making a faustian bargain when he agreed to Hu Zongnan's plan, but the speed to which his China Revival Society moved to consolidate control was headspinning. With ruthless drive, they swept away any obstacles to perceived inefficiency, which evidently included what little democratic institutions were left standing in Nanjing. With minimal debate and at a rapid pace, the rump Legislative Yuan has voted to grant Hu Zongnan emergency powers as Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission.\n\nMuch to to Sun Fo's shock, Hu has ordered the Legislative Yuan indefinitely suspended for the duration of the emergency, concentrating power around the MAC. He was sure to place his friends in high places, with He Zhonghan being appointed Headmaster of Whampoa and Deng Wenyi Minister of War. Dai Chunfeng's specific position has not formally changed, but he's been lurking about in the shadows. Zhang Fakui has been appointed Director of the Hu's Headquarters, but kept effectively powerless as Sun Fo's faction find themselves sidelined within his own government.\n\nThe Premier thought to himself with tragic stoicism how remarkably dim the new CRS masters could be, for all their pretentions ultimately their solution to all problems was brute force. Should that ever fail, he mused, they would have nothing.\n\nThe test to see whether or not these young upstarts would even have a chance to rule is soon approaching. Deng Yanda and his army are on the verge of attacking Wuhan, defended by an outnumbered garrison led by Xue Yue. The convention decision would be to use a flotilla of gunboats and river transports to quickly relieve the city. But the bolder commanders have suggested striking Fujian itself while it is vulnerable, so convinced of their ideological superiority they believe nothing can keep them from their destiny."
CHI.lategame.380.a: "Transfer troops west to defend Wuhan."
CHI.lategame.380.b: "March south to destroy Deng's home base."

CHI.lategame.381.t: "The Battle of Wuchang"
CHI.lategame.381.d: "Having moved quickly to defend Wuhan, Hu Zongnan's men arrived just in time to square off against Deng Yanda's forces. To the relief of the swamped city garrison, reinforcements arrived by the river to help secure key fortifications outside of the city, beating back various probing attacks made by the Fujian Army.\n\nLocked into a siege and forced to pull back divisions from a planned assault on Changsha, Deng committed his forces against the city but struggled to make way as his weary and undersupplied men were often bested grinding against enemy fortifications. All the while, Hu Zongnan's main relief force made their way west, finally arriving after several days. Driving hard into Deng's right flank, Nanjing's elite divisions trounced Deng's exhausted forces, routing them. With his flank on the verge of collapse, Deng had little choice but to withdraw the rest of his army from the Wuhan campaign, breaking the siege.\n\nThe General and his men outshone their rivals that day, but now are forced to make a hard decision as their Wuhan defenders and their Nanjing relief forces link up. Reports from the central plains indicate that Zhang Zhizhong's RCA-aligned army has been on the move from  [GetVictoryPointName_9843], and their scouts has been searching for an effective crossing point along the Yangtze. To pursue the retreating Fujian army would mean potentially giving the strategic advantage to [GetVictoryPointName_9843], but to not do so would allow Deng Yanda to reform his forces for a potential counter-attack."
CHI.lategame.381.a: "Hold along the Yangtze."
CHI.lategame.381.b: "March south to Nanchang."

CHI.lategame.382.t: "The Siege of Nanchang"
CHI.lategame.382.d: "Deng decided to make his stand by Nanchang, a PAC-stronghold. Using his irregulars to slow down the CRS's advance, his men have spent the better part of the day fortifying their positions near the river-city. The army of the PAC are far better prepared than at Wuchang, but their foes have seen their morale skyrocket since their initial victory. Reinforced with parts of the Wuhan garrison, Hu Zongnan's army has been in hot pursuit and advanced units soon skirmished along the field of battle. Small units of PAC shock-troopers move agilely behind enemy lines, hoping to secure an advantage for their artillery. Their foes have countered with swift mechanised companies and aircraft strafing from above.\n\nThis battle will probably go down in history as the ultimate showdown between the National Revolutionary Army's \"Old\" vs \"Young\" guard. The defenders include many of the elite columns from MinGan, men who have fought for over a decade. They are skilled in utilising the terrain to their fullest advantage and are well-practiced in a mixed style of combat - fighting both assymetrically and conventionally. The attackers include most of the best divisions trained abroad, utilising the latest in modern warfare. They have integrated combined arms, fielding a deadly combination of artillery, mechanised, and airborne support.\n\nAs the sound of blasting artillery fill the air and smoke billows, the RCA threat feels more and more distant. In an epic conclusion of the campaign, the two armies clash near this vital supply-base - which might very well be the turning point of the war."
CHI.lategame.382.a: "Hu Zongan's fanatic professionals win the day!"
CHI.lategame.382.b: "Deng Yanda's steady veterans stand triumphant!"

CHI.lategame.383.t: "The Zhejiang Campaign"
CHI.lategame.383.d: "Zhejiang was where Hu Zongnan was born and raised, though if he wished to show off to anyone back home he did not show it. Instead, he and his elite divisions marched southwards in an ambitious operation, hoping to cut off Deng Yanda's supply-lines from its roots. The undermanned garrisons of Wuhan would simply have to hold out on their own, and once the Fujian operation was successful Deng's forces would be caught in a vise.\n\nThings did not work out as planned. PAC aligned guerillas roamed the countryside with the help of sympathetic peasants, picking apart isolated CRS units at leisure. Nanjing's supply-lines were quickly snarled and General Hu's army made slow progress across the Zhejiang hills. Despite their elite status and expensive equipment, their fighting capabilities were quickly sapped by the strains of the campaign.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Deng's men have quickly stormed Wuhan in a determined assault, with many soldiers unwilling to fight a hopeless battle for a tinpot despot. Learning that his foe was driving towards his home-territory, the \"Red Napoleon\" and his men had little time to celebrate their victory before they were forced to pivot southwards to intercept the trudging Nanjing advance.\n\nHis staff officers presented him with two different approaches for the looming fight. The first would be to face him in a frontal battle, further away from the MinGan heartland and its infrastructure but also closer to Nanjing as well.

Hu is a stubborn man and a dauntless attacker, but once word arrived of Wuhan's fall even he knew it was time to cut his losses.\n\nHis decision to turn back and retreat towards Nanjing probably prevented him from being fully encircled, but his men had taken severe casualties. Deng Yanda's Fujian army and Hu Zongnan's Nanjing army did not make direct contact between the main forces, with neither side willing to take the risk of fully commiting their reserves. However, in the thickets and hills their skirmishers traded heavy fire in an intense week.\n\nBy the end of it, Deng had won a tactical victory though fell short of his hopes of fully destroying the enemy army. As he works to regather his scattered militias back to his main force, rumours have reached him that [GetVictoryPointName_9843]'s long absent force will soon by at the Yangtze river, hoping to make a crossing and strike Nanjing.\n\nThe pressure is now on for Deng as he prepares for a fateful choice. His men have been fighting for weeks now, and it will take time to reinforce his divisions until they are fully battle-ready again.

Sailors, officers, and even entire ships have defected in large droves, breaking any chance of a meaningful blockade of the Eastern seaboard.\n\nMany crews have been confronted with a common problem however, of where to go next? Many sailors are Fujianese and trained in Fujian academies, and consequently have familial ties with the burgeoning rebellion in their home province. On the other hand, plenty have received training from abroad and been exposed to Marxist thinking. The RCA and their unions have improved plenty of their lives, or at least promise to. And there is of course the countless clashes between the army leadership the WMARCA in Fujian embody and the naval establishment, always leaving the fleet with the short end of the stick.\n\nUltimately these choices are often made by individuals fleeing under the cover the night or perhaps smaller, tight-knit crews.

Even as many in the military found their way into seditionist camps, Zhang remained a steadfast defender of the government and an anchor for which the civilian Wang and the RCA could depend on to fend off Bonapartism within the military. With a civil war underway, he and the Political Department Clique were the backbone in which the army of Chen Gongbo's [GetVictoryPointName_9843] government was built upon.\n\nSmaller than the other factions, they were nonetheless determined to prevail as they gathered in Baoding. Clued in thanks to some valuable intelligence gathered by Zhou Enlai's men, he learned of the CRS's effective coup in Nanjing. Based off that intel he recognised that the armies of Nanjing and Fujian would likely tire themselves out fighting one another and so Zhang decided to wait before leading his army down south.\n\nFresh for the impending fight, their vanguard has arrived at the Yangtze river, battling scattered garrisons hoping to prevent them from crossing. Nanjing forces have raced to blow up bridges to delay their advance as Zhang's men search for a weakpoint. Should they be successful, Zhang believes many remaining loyalists hiding in the Jiangnan and Anhui regions (the focus of RCA recruitment and development efforts for years) will rise up in support.

#Scenario 3 Wrapup (390-399)
CHI.lategame.390.t: "The Dust Settles in the East!"
CHI.lategame.390.d.RCA: "In the end, for all the machinations and all the slander of Wang's foes, the people stood behind the Chairman's legacy. After some bumps along the way, Chen Gongbo's forces were able to rally and continue their push south against Nanjing, taking the capital in a renewed offensive. For an army initially in the worst spot, surrounded by disloyal garrisons and outnumbered by their peers, the bulk of the credit for their ultimate victory can only be accredited to the goodwill their fallen leader had generated among the people.\n\nChen acknowledged as much in his speech in [GetVictoryPointName_9843]. In a fiery speech shortly after the garrison's surrender and an uprising of RCA loyalists in the five provinces, he promises to continue on with the revolution the way Wang wanted it, truly realising the Kuomintang's revolutionary aims against capitalist exploitation.\n\nWith his successful campaign against Nanjing, most of the outlying provinces and commanders have declared for Chen's faction - ejecting representatives from Nanjing and Fujian. The Fujian rebellion, realising the futility of the situation, has surrended. Song Qingling surrendered peacefully, though Deng Yanda's whereabouts are unknown - he has either went underground or fled into exile.\n\nIt does not matter anyhow. The people have spoken, and the conspirators vanquished. Chen Gongbo has accepted the position of Party Chairman and Premier of the Executive Yuan. However, he has made the decision to endorse Zeng Zhongming, Wang's former secretary and the scion of the Residence Faction, as the nation's new President. Chu Minyi, looking utterly battered from his imprisonment (a drastic contrast to his once muscular constitution), looked on behind the new Presidential-Premier pair. It is clear who holds all the cards now."
CHI.lategame.390.d.PAC: "No side really prepared for a long war, but after a few weeks it was clear that one came out on top in the end, avoiding fears of a prolonged civil war. Deng Yanda, the conquering general and the champion of Song Qingling and her Provisional Action Committee has emerged triumphant, sweeping all opposition. Though there may have been some stumbling blocks along the way, the experience of the officers of the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association proved decisive in Fujian's renewed push north against Nanjing.\n\nAs they approached the city, many troops defected to their side as momentum built. Li Jishen played a pivotal, if less acknowledged role as Minister of War, swaying many garrisons and governors still on the fence across the nation. By the time Nanjing had fallen, most had thrown their lot with Fujian, trusting the experienced commander. To the north, the wavering garrisons in Manchuria and Hebei grew fed up with Chen Gongbo's pretenses. Turning on him, Chen was arrested and exiled, and thus the nation was unified.\n\nTriumphantly, Song Qingling has been sworn in as President of the Republic. The Provisional Action Committee is provisional no more - and they have begun to rebrand themselves the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang. That said, her troubles are far from over. Her allies in the World Society, including Cai Yuanpei and the Four Elders who had backed her throughout the civil war, have grown disenchanted by the increased political role of the military. Likewise, the representatives of the defeated, including Sun Fo of the RF, Gu Mengyu of the RCA-Moderates, and Chen Duxiu of the CSP, all receiving amnesty in exchange for cooperation, have expressed concern about the future ahead."
CHI.lategame.390.d.GOV: "Inertia is often difficult to overcome. Many garrisons of outlying provinces sat on the fence for the last few weeks under the guise of \"mobilising\", entertaining audiences with representatives of the various governments. Even those directly sitting in Nanjing, [GetVictoryPointName_9843], or Fujian were liable to for some wafering, knowing that failing to be on the winning side often carried deathly consequences. In the end however, the existing governmental infrastructure of Nanjing had a pull difficult to escape from.\n\nAfter major talks, Sun Fo and Song Qingling came to an accord, reforging the shaky opposition alliance that sought to oust Wang. Song has taken on the role of President and Chairman of the party, while Sun Fo has agreed to be Vice Chairman and Premier of the Executive Yuan. The specific makeup of the cabinent and other matters remain a source of continuing discussion, however for now the nation has been peacefully united.\n\nChen Gongbo's [GetVictoryPointName_9843] government has been betrayed by the fed-up Hebei and Manchurian garrisons, who marched into the vulnerable city with Zhang Zhizhong's army still prowling around the south. Chen has been allowed to flee peacefully overseas with many of his allies, while Zhang's forces surrendered to Deng shortly afterwards under the condition of amnesty. The China Revival Society lingers on, though heavily distrusted for their roles in recent riots. They will get their due soon enough.\n\nFor now however, Song Qingling and Sun Fo bask in the moment, co-victors in the fight against Wang's tyranny. Already cracks have emerged in their alliance though, and a schism is likely if negotiations fail to produce many results in the near future. Waiting on the wings is the World Society, which have played an integral role in helping Song take power. The CSP and RCA-Moderates are said to have been cowed by the army, though this is not the end for them quite yet."
CHI.lategame.390.d.CRS: "Drastic times often call for drastic measures, but one must always ask \"at what cost?\" Beset with rebels on all sides, the disintegrating government of Sun Fo was forced to turn to military extremists to salvage their position. If their goal was to stem the tide and prevent a prolonged civil war, Hu Zongnan did not disappoint.\n\nHammered from north and south, the soldiers of the China Revival Society proved their might in an extended campaign. Even in defeat, many continued to fight on with the \"Whampoa Spirit\" of indomitable, fanatical courage that prevailed over Nanjing's enemies. Zhang Zhizhong's Yangtze river campaign proved to be a bust in the end, too far from their northern supply-bases to sustain such a violent campaign for very long. Brutally crushed in the ensuing fights, many of their units melted away or even defected.\n\nTo the south, Deng Yanda's renewed attempt to take Nanjing ultimately came to naught. After a few weeks grinding against Nanjing's fanatical divisions, most governors of outlying provinces had enough and sided with the central government. The garrisons in Hebei and Manchuria, having lost heart betrayed Chen Gongbo and forced him into ignominous exile. With most of the country against them, Fujian devolved into infighting and was forced to surrender.\n\nHu Zongnan now stands as the effective leader of the nation, having effectively sidelined Sun Fo and prevented any negotiation that might dilute the Kuomintang's revolutionary promises. Throughout the campaign, he has worryingly been addressing himself as Generalissimo, a concern that was fully realised today in Nanjing with his confirmation as President for the duration of the continuing emergency. Behind him is a camarilla of selected, primarily military officers of the CRS. Some like He Zhonghan prefer the spotlight (though never allowed more than the Red Generalissimo himself), while others like Dai Chunfeng and Deng Wenyi are content with machinations in the background."

The fallout of the vitriolic Third Repatriated National Congress of the Kuomintang was made quickly apparent with the sudden assassination of Wang Jingwei and the flight of politicians of both the Wang-aligned RCA and the leading PAC opposition from Nanjing.\n\nAlready, fierce skirmishes are being waged across the Kuomintang's most vital provinces in eastern China, as three competing governments have emerged in [GetVictoryPointName_9843], Nanjing, and Fujian. The RCA have rallied under Chen Gongbo, one of Wang's most loyal and trusted lieutenants. Unlike Wang, he has expressed little interest in maintaining our alliance. To the south in Fujian Song Qingling, Deng Yanda, and Li Jishen have reactivated their old insurgency bases to contest national leadership. Often harboring personal hatred for Chen Jiongming and his Federalist movement, they have taken hard-line stances against us. In Nanjing Sun Fo's government would normally offer some hope for a democratic alternative, but it is widely suspected that his doddering regime will soon fall to military radicals.\n\nSo what would be one more contender? If it is obvious that none of the three contenders have any intention of implementing even the base-level Federalist ideals of local democracy, then any agreements we have signed are null.

In coming days, with the crisis no closer to resolving between the three (well, now four) competing governments, other governors are expected to begin taking sides on the matter.\n\nIn hindsight, leaving such a prominent loose end was always bound to have been trouble for the Kuomintang as they transitioned to a peace-time tutelage. Indeed, odds are that, even in happier times, such an arrangement would have been unsustainable.

Since the exile of the First Northern Expedition to now, the left-wing has been dominant in national politics, acknowledged by many nations throughout the world as the true wing of the Chinese Nationalist Party.\n\nThe fall out of the chaotic Third Repatriated National Congress of the Kuomintang is now made apparent with the sudden assassination of the Party's chairman Wang Jingwei and the flight of both the Wang-aligned RCA and PAC opposition from Nanjing. Already, fierce skirmishes are being waged across the Kuomintang's most vital provinces in easter China, as three competing governments have emerged in [GetVictoryPointName_9843], Nanjing, and Fujian. RCA forces have rallied under Chen Gongbo, one of Wang's most loyal and trusted lieutentants. Unlike Wang, he has expressed little interest in maintaining our alliance, declaring us as reactionaries to the Party. In Nanjing, Sun Fo's weak government has offered us a chance to finally mend old ties and to work with the Nanjing Government to unify and honour the late Premier's will and direction. Perhaps this is a chance for us to show us our value and strength in keeping the nation unified and we are able to pursue a much more deradicalised tone of the revolution.\n\nIn any case, there is also the opportunity for us to finally break free from Nanjing's eyes and to pursue our own direction of Dr. Sun's will.

CHI.lategame.401.t: "The Grain Quagmire"
CHI.lategame.401.d: "Grains are a staple food, the lifeblood of the Chinese people. So discussions on grain and taxations are always a headache, subject to landlord interests and peasant unrest. The government's stake in the matter is ensuring that yields are sufficient to feed the nation,to adequately (and hopefully fairly) tax this major component in the national economy, and also to store grain to feed the destitute and also prepare for famines.\n\nWith the landlords either brought to heel or expropriated, the party has stressed that they are different from the greedy warlords that came before them. But some have soured due to the disparities in the new government's promises compared to the realities on the ground - much of the grain supposed to be going to public granaries have been stolen by corrupt bureaucrats and taxation has been uneven at best. Many farmers have refused to contribute, accusing our magistrates of being thieves. It is very difficult without good documentation to tax the farmers, and this type of bureaucratic infrastructure simply does not exist yet.\n\nAlternatives have been proposed, including taxing grain yields directly and eliminating other farm taxes altogether. Given how little is collected in practice, this would help increase government revenues but is bound to be unpopular with the peasants. But with wars and the debts that accompany them accruing, it is a tempting proposition. Perhaps one day industry and commerce will take the place of primary economic sectors, but for now it seems the earth provides life to the state as well."

CHI.lategame.402.d: "The salt tax is about as ancient as the Chinese state, with records suggesting that the Han dynasty ordered salt and iron to become state monopolies in the first century BC. Scholars at the time believed that an indirect tax on the people was best to fund the government without directly risking the ire of the people. Nearly two millennia later, salt remains a major source of wealth and power - though even before the warlord era it was a heavily patchwork system.\n\nThe Kuomintang has maintained their salt monopoly and its accompanying gabelle (indirect tax), and by some accounts it pays for upwards of a third of the government's overall revenue. Wresting salt revenues from warlords has been a major source of wrangling, tensions, and diplomacy though with the conquest of northern China's salterns the prospect of a new revenue boon has enticed multiple government organs.\n\nTo collect these taxes, escort funds, and enforce the monopoly entire regiments have been independently formed both by our predecessors and our new central government. These units are often well-trained and equipped, able to afford better supplies and often tasked with crushing rebellious warlords. The Ministry of Finance under Song Ziwen was one of the first to organise their Salt Gabelle brigades and consequently have the largest dedicated force. He insists on its necessity to prop up government banks and currency.\n\nThe Ministry of Interior on the contrary however insist such brigades belong under their jurisdiction, since law enforcement is a police matter and they have greater expertise. The army has thrown their lot in, suggesting that perhaps with all the instability, only they can be trusted with such a task.\n\nPresident Wang and the CEC have agreed that the overlapping jurisdictions must end. The only question is who will receive the ultimate grant. Left unsaid is the mouth-watering amounts of money that can be skimmed off."

CHI.lategame.601.d: "Although professing to be a revolutionary vanguard, that does not mean the Kuomintang intends to leave the people out of the revolutionary struggle. Indeed, they have mobilised peoples, men and women, from all corners of the nation. And they have hardly forgotten the youth.\n\nLin Bosheng, the Minister of Propaganda, organised the Youth Corps (Qingnian tuan) for youths between 16-25. Members swore absolute loyalty to the party and given paramilitary training. The Corps morphed into the Youth League (Qingshaonian tuan), operates summer camps dedicated to teaching public speaking, propaganda, and \"self assessment\".\n\nThe PAC and their military allies have formed their own Chinese New Democracy Youth League, an outgrowth of other youth movements established in the MinGan era. Similarly authoritarian in bent, they seek to create a totally dedicated and altruistic youth, meant to evangelise and organise to the masses for the revolutionary struggle.\n\nOthers have tried to mimic them with less success. The League of Chinese Syndicalists have created the Syndicalist Youth League of China, skirting the bounds of their ostensibly democratic ideology. The China Revival Society have formed the Three Principles of the People Youth League, somehow even more extreme in its militaristic totalitarianism than the others.\n\nIronically, perhaps the most unique (due to its mundaneness) is the Boy Scouts of China, patronised by families affiliated with the Reconstruction Faction. Based off Baden-Powell's international movement, it provides a \"contained\" form of youth activism, with an emphasis on individual cultivation, a slight degree of apolitical liberalism, and a dash of military discipline perfect for the RF.

CHI.lategame.602.d: "Whampoa Military Academy was primarily an army school, though it did have a few naval and air cadets. As the Republic of China's air force expands, it found that Whampoa had far too few aviation-trained cadets to man even their burgeoning air force. In fact, it was only very recently that the Aviation Committee of the Military Affairs Commission became their own independent branch, and they have scoured for competent pilots trained both in China and abroad.\n\nTo help alleviate this shortage, a Central Aviation School is to be established - perhaps the first major undertaking of the Republic of China Air Force. Sadly, despite their small size, the Air Force has already fallen into infighting as the various cliques jockey over the next Super-Intendant of the CAS.\n\nAlthough nowhere near enough to fill all billets, Whampoa did churn out a few exceptional candidates. Tang Duo is another natural choice for the position, a graduate of the Work-Study programme in France who both attended Whampoa and helped establish the Kuomintang's first aircraft factory in Guangzhou. He received further training in France during the exile period and has direct experience in flight training.\n\nLong Wenguang was a pilot in the MinGan insurgency, primarily flying reconnaissance aircraft and barely escaping capture by League forces. His heroics have captured the attention of many in the army, boosting his prospects. Likewise, Xu Huangsheng was a fellow graduate of Whampoa noted for his personal courage. Selected as Chiang Kai-shek's personal pilot, he received further training in Britain before becoming an air instructor.

The Kuomintang's Foreign Minister Chen Youren has received the petition enthusiastically, citing Korea and China's long standing history together and their shared desire to see the Japanese truly driven out of Asia.\n\nAfter some negotiations which placed the battalion's leadership under the former Whampoa alumni Kim Wonbong, the Korean Volunteer Corps (KVC) was founded. Some members of the Volunteer Corps such as Choi Chang-ik are even involved with the Military Affairs Commission of the NRA, with the latter being involved in the MAC's Political Department and known for holding sympathies towards Chen Gongbo's radical RCA. Wonbong himself is known to harbour sympathies for the Provisional Action Committee's grass-roots revolutionary ideals, and as such, Wonbong and Chang-ik are known for their frequent clashes. The KVC is split into two teams: Team 1  is led by Captain Park Hyo-sam from South Hamgyong Province (as well as a personal friend of Wonbong's), and Team 2 is directed by Lee Ik-seong from North Hamgyong Province - both men have graduated from the Whampoa Military Academy.\n\nThe members of the KVC are fluent in Korean, Chinese, and Japanese, and some of their tactics include anti-war leaflets, loudspeakers to carry out anti-war propaganda, interrogations and the indoctrination of prisoners.

The Bintang Tiga, known as the Three Star Army, claim to stand for a multi-racial Malay Commune - uniting Malay, Chinese, and Indian citizens together. Although their leadership is contested domestically, with our help there is hope we can turn our occupation into liberation.\n\nTo help mobilise the locals into action, the 10th Malay Regiment has been established with the help of Chinese advisors. Named after the 10 Zulhijah, an Islamic holiday remembering Abraham's sacrifice of Ishmael, they are expected to make self-sacrifices in the name of freedom. Built from a core of earlier Chinese aligned volunteers known as the Overseas Chinese Army (nicknamed the Two-Star Army), the 10th Malay Regiment has swelled into division size due to an influx of nationalist paramilitaries, defecting colonial soldiers and police, and various local socialists volunteers.

Still, Foreign Minister Chen Youren along with various sympathetic commanders such as Zhang Fakui have made it their personal project to aid the anti-imperialist revolutionaries in Indochina.\n\nThis project has unfortunately has proven far more difficult than initially assumed. After their brutal suppression by colonial authorities, the Viet Minh have scattered due to internal ideological tensions and regional rivalries. Consequently, there have not been any one unified government-in-exile, and Chen has desperately sought to cobble together what surviving leadership exists.\n\nThe splinter faction closest to [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] was the \"Overseas Ministry\" led by Nguyen Thai Hoc, and they became the cornerstone of the KMT-backed provisional government. But bringing the Indochinese revolutionary groups together again is no easy task. Despite our best efforts, Vietnamese nationalists and republicans remain wary of committing. Meanwhile, Hoc has proven to be an active detriment to maintaining order thanks to his noxious combination of increasingly zealous rhetoric and the trigger-happy VNQDD Assassination Squads under his direct control. Cambodians and Laotians have also been uncooperative with our Indochinese project, suspicious of their eastern neighbour due to historical conflagrations between the three groups.\n\nFaced with such a predicament, [CHI.GetLeader] has given local commanders discretion to solve problems on an ad-hoc basis; it seems that a final settlement will simply have to wait until the war is over. Still, the Kuomintang have not walked away completely empty handed. Inspired by the NRA's successes and hoping to claim a seat in the eventual negotiating table, insurgent cells in remaining occupied territory have reawaken.

Xenophobia permeates the agency, with staff members high and low suspicious of foreigners and even domestic minority groups. As part of Chinese efforts to cooperate with broader international socialist efforts, the MMIC has been reinforced with advisors led by Jakob Rudnik (who goes by a pseudonym Niu Lan and has also been referred to as Paul Ruegg) to help train and coordinate the MSS in intelligence gathering.\n\nRelations have been rocky. With the MSS dominated by ex-military and other ideologically vetted personnel, most are wary of their British and French peers. The more experienced operatives can remember times when they were arrested by colonial police in the legations, including Dai Chunfeng who was once humiliated in Hong Kong. To many, the British and French will never stop being imperialists, socialist or not. The arrival of Mission 204, also known as the \"Tulip Force\" of British and Australasian commandoes has only reinforced this perception. About 180 men in total, MSS officers have gone to the press accusing them of being politicians and adventurers rather than soldiers, and of being akin to a rowdy band of foreign mercenaries. Sordid rumours of theft, harassment of Chinese women, and commandeering local houses have been fanned by the press, taking tropes from earlier imperialist marauders.\n\nMSS higher-ups, for their part, have dragged their feet in reigning in their subordinates. Ministry leaders regularly bicker with their advisors and have been accused of being uncooperative. They have advanced a myriad of unsubstantiated but often accepted charges - ranging from the MMIC spying on the MSS to the MMIC bypassing MSS leadership to talk to the CEC directly. This prejudice, and the dysfunctional system it has spawned is unlikely to be fixed in the near future. But the MMIC has asked the CEC to step in and sideline the worst offenders, a power play they believe will alleviate at least some of the problems."

Nor subdued by threat of force!\nWe will defend our party's safety and protect our nation's sovereign soil.\nWe will ever be thus unyielding and steady, well ordered and earnest.\nThrough hardships and labour with one mind we strive on!\nWe are the great wall of the nation and the vanguard of the race.\nRevolutionary youth, quickly prepare, Be wise, humane and brave!\nGrasp the pulse of this stage. Stand before this great age!\n                      - Song of the Linli Training Class of the BIS\n\nThe Juntong have been busy ever since the Northern Expedition. Across the countryside, they have used their authority to build training camps, officially for agent training but often indoctrinating large swaths of inductees into the China Revival Society. These camps are built far away from the prying eyes of civilisation, trainees often swear direct loyalty to Dai Chunfeng, and these \"forbidden zones\" are sealed off from even senior party magistrates (at gunpoint). Women have been banned lest they be honeytraps, and all agents are not allowed to marry while in service.\n\nDai's personal fortress is said to be built in \"Happy Valley\" (Geleshan), three valleys surrounded by a ring of hills and farmland. Anyone foolish enough to draw near to the electric fences without a transit pass were killed. The only outsiders that were allowed in are a few trusted MMIC advisors, often at the fringe of the mission. Stories have spread of a \"White Mansion\" (Baigongguan) where dissidents are tortured and executed. With the facility set to expand to nearly a thousand buildings, perhaps it worth reflecting on the faustian bargain we have made."

CHI.lategame.703.t: "Special Methods in Action"
CHI.lategame.703.d: "Agents of foreign imperialism are ubiquitous in a land subject to nearly a century of colonialism. Comprador bourgeoisie, mercenaries, spies, and other collaborators of all stripes remain everywhere, threatening to subvert the revolution. Many threaten to defect to outside powers, fearing that native reactionary stooges have failed to contain the people's spirit.\n\nThey all have their excuses when confronted, but none can escape the the paranoid eyes of the Teke. With ruthless abandon and legendary precision, they have gone about eliminating enemies of the revolution. The euphemism \"special methods\" has now become a byword for the tactics used by the Teke, and it would appear these special methods are being used more and more.\n\nAs the Teke spring into action, most members of the party are prudent enough not to ask how the sausage is made and have elected to look the other way. On the other hand, there have been concerns, quiet at first but now growing. Some of those killed were prominent and not necessarily disliked by the public. There have been calls for greater accountability as the Teke expands from a small revolutionary agency to China's premier intelligence service, calling for the Military Affairs Commission to reign in the extrajudicial killings and implement some due process.\n\nThese concerns of course likely have ulterior motives. It seems that Zhou Enlai has not been afraid to use the Teke against internal opponents as necessary, particularly in his rivalry against Dai Chunfeng. Even outside of internal party rivalries, the \"Dog-killers League\" (Dagou tuan) has been especially contentious, responsible for killing alleged pary renegades. One has to wonder who the next batch of \"counter-revolutionaries\" will be."

CHI.lategame.801.t: "Sha Fei, the Revolution's Photographer"
CHI.lategame.801.d: "Born Situ Chuan in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, Chuan enlisted in the National Revolutionary Army in 1926 during the First Northern Expedition as a telegraph operator. After the expedition's failure, he fled for Song Qingling's MinGan Insurgency, where he developed  hobby for photography. In particular, he developed as fascination for \"realistic\" photographs unlike the international models that he would see in foreign magazines.\n\nHe would frequently travel across Fujian, taking photos of poverty-stricken children and families and would also go to Shanghai to meet and photograph intellectuals such as Lu Xun. With the Northern Expedition in full swing, he took the name Sha Fei (meaning flying sand) in order to document the revolution on the frontline. His photographs capture instances of military actions while upholding the Kuomintang cause as just and righteous, even in their handling of enemy POWs.\n\nUnfortunately, this talented photographer is now currently in a mental hospital. Weeks of photographing the bloodiest aspects of war, mangled limbs, military brutality, and devastation across China have taken their toll on the young photographer. While he is currently diagnosed with mental illness and tuberculosis, there is hope yet, that he will eventually recover."

CHI.lategame.802.d: "\"Eradicate all religious and social superstitions! Eradicate superstition to cleanse the cradle of the revolution!\" This year's Mid-Autumn Festival's festivities have found themselves interrupted by a slew of posters and articles denouncing the seemingly superstitious nature of traditional Chinese festivals.\n\nInstead of attending the festivities and eating moon-cakes, some revolutionary-minded individuals decided to attend anti-superstition assemblies organised by the Social Customs Reform Committee (SCRC). In Zhejiang, where there are many branches belonging to the Reorganised Comrades Association, party members of the Zhejianese RCA have urged government officials to prohibit traditional holidays such as the Mid-Autumn Festival - in order to preserve Nanjing's identity as the cradle of the revolution.\n\nThe RCA politician Zhou Fohai who is serving as Zhejiang's local SCRC chairman has declared that there are but three stages to human development \"the age of the divine, the age of imperial sovereignty, and finally the age of popular sovereignty (Minquan).\" As the latter is the current age of the Chinese Revolution, so it must be true that the people must abandon their traditional and superstitious worship of the moon. His comments were met favourably by many in the Radical Faction of the RCA, some of whom like Chen Gongbo have expressed that a total \"Cultural Revolution\" is needed to purify the degenerate aspects of the \"Old China.\"\n\nAs such efforts have aroused the local villages and towns who are protesting this seemingly intrusive move into one's local culture, local leaders have voiced their opposition to Kuomintang overreach; charging that the RCA is seeking to subvert local cultures and are seeking to overthrow centuries of tradition. After significant protests, the national government has relented for this year, though it is clear the broader battle is not over."

CHI.lategame.803.t: "The Zhongshan Suit Explodes in Popularity!"
CHI.lategame.803.d: "When the Republic of China was proclaimed in 1911 with the Xinhai Revolution, the style of dress worn at the time in China was heavily influenced by the Manchu tradition. Both the qipao and the changshan were imposed upon the Han peoples by the Qing as a form of social control. In an attempt to modernise not just the Chinese nation but also Chinese society (akin to the Meiji Restoration's effect on the changing of Japanese dress), Chinese intellectuals and the elite began to combine elements of both Western and Chinese dress.\n\nThe Zhongshan suit therefore is a product of such a cultural revolution. The tunic was introduced by the founder of the Kuomintang himself, Sun Yat-sen and features a suit based on the Japanese cadet uniform. The four pockets on the suit are said to represent the four virtues of propriety, justice, honesty, and shame while the five buttons on the tunic represent the five branches of the Nationalist government.\n\nThe suit's popularity since the Nationalist government's return to the mainland has exploded in popularity. Government officials frequently don the suit as a symbol of proletarian unity and as an Eastern counterpart to the Western business suit."

It comes from the Liangyou Book Company under Wu Liande although recent editions have been edited by Liang Desuo and Ma Guoliang.\n\nAside from featuring generals of the National Revolutionary Army such as Zhang Fakui, the pictorial is notable for its cover-girls. Beautiful women adorn the covers of recent editions, they appear to be shown \"moving in motion\" and participating in Western sports while dressed in Western clothes - making such editorials popular amongst soldiers in the NRA. Nonetheless, these women on the pictorial covers are not dressed to be seeking men, but rather they are living their lives and enjoying the high life in Shanghai. Such women who appear on the covers include actresses such as Anna May Wong and Chen Bo'er but also female officers of the NRA such as Hu Lanqi."

CHI.lategame.805.t: "Promoting the Bicycle"
CHI.lategame.805.d: "The bicycle is a primitive and widespread method of transportation, one that the Nationalist Ministry of Transportation has been promoting. While the bicycle began to enter Chinese society by 1860, it did not win approval nor did it become integrated into Chinese society. Due to the fact that the bicycle was used primarily by Westerners, it became seen as merely a tool and curious handiwork of the foreign imperialists.\n\nFurthermore, the use of feet in the bicycle seems to deride the Chinese notion of luxury travel as many Chinese who were unfamiliar with the bicycle were accustomed to the rickshaw (as their feet would not be moved). Bicycles thus elicited a curious notion from the Chinese, who were inspired by the stamina of the cyclist as well as the speed of which one could travel on a bike.\n\nThe Nationalist Government seeks to expand transportation measures for those who are unable to afford an automobile. While initially a luxury item, the price of the bicycle has become so affordable that it is envisioned for half a million bicycles to be in circulation in China by 1949."

CHI.lategame.806.d: "Perhaps due to her lineage, she was borne to live a life of greatness - a remarkable life for a young \"New Women\" in a new revolutionary age of Chinese politics. Descended from the the renowned late Qing General Zeng Guoquan (one of the brothers of the famous Zeng Guofan of the Xiang Army that helped crush the Taiping Rebellion), Zeng Xianzhi was born on January 23, 1910 at Baishutang in Changsha, Hunan.\n\nDuring the late 1920s and early 1930s, schools across China began accepting more girls and Zeng Xianzhi was a member of the basketball team of her local secondary school. Under the influence of the Chinese revolutionary and socialist Xu Teli, Zeng threw herself into the national revolution by joining the Northern Expedition as one of the few women at the Whampoa Military Academy. When the expedition failed, she fled for the MinGan Insurgency, where she became a political instructor and a traffic coordinator for the insurgents.\n\nHer dedication and self-less commitment to the ideals of the national revolution have recently earned her praise from the upper echelons of the party including Song Qingling who has described her as the ideal Chinese female revolutionary. In recent days, she is now the personal secretary of the Chinese stateswoman and wife of General Zhou Enlai, Deng Yingchao."

CHI.lategame.807.d: "Left alone without allies, many in the Party feared the worst when the Japanese declared war on us - perhaps in their desperate attempt to maintain imperialism over China and to divide our country from Manchuria. In the air, our forces are simply no match against the Imperial Japanese Air Force, which fields some of the most modern planes in the world and the most experienced air force in Asia.\n\nWith total air supremacy, the Japanese Air Force has been at work - bombing our cities, killing our people, and destabilising our military operations due to their control of the air. However, in our hour of need, [FRA.GetNameDef] and [ENG.GetNameDef] has sent us a squadron of volunteers from around the world led by the French pilot André Japy, an expert pilot from France. While most of these volunteers are French and British, there are also a considerable amount of Italians and reportedly even some Norweigen pilots; all of whom have arrived in China in secret, posing as tourists. These volunteers have arrived with Hawker Fury monoplanes and have come to bolster morale and train prospective pilots so that they, too, may carry out the fight in the air. With their help, perhaps it will be feasible for us to regain control of our skies as we fight with our comrades in the great struggle against imperialism."

CHI.lategame.808.t: "Dragonboats in Nationalist China"
CHI.lategame.808.d: "The socialist writer and affiliate of the LCS, the Marxist Guo Moruo has recently completed his play \"Qu Yuan\", based on the famous poet Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet and politician from the State of Chu during the Warring States Period. The play has likened the traditional Chinese literary hero to a \"people's poet\" and one of the first socialist revolutionaries in Chinese history. With comparisons made to Hamlet and King Lear, the play has exemplified Qu's social idealism and his great patriotism as a model for all Chinese to follow in this era of national revolution.\n\nAccording to the legends, Qu Yuan had served the State of Chu but had been exiled numerous times by his jealous rivals in the Chu court and thus spent his time in exile, collecting legends and rearranging folk oldes. In addition, he also spent his time writing great poetry and writing profoundly on the nature ofn the Chinese state. His anxiety however would bring him to an increasingly troubled state of health, and he was reported to have taken walks to view his emaciated face in the reflection of a well. In roughly 278 BCE, after his country's capital, the city of Ying, fell to the fearsome General Bai Qi of the State of Qin - Qu Yuan wrote a deep lament for the collapse of his state. He then ended his life, by wading into Miluo River while carrying a stone - perhaps out of sheer patriotism.\n\nA popular legend emerged, that villagers had attempted to sail out into the lake with dumplings and their boats to save Qu Yuan but were unable to do so. In their desperation, they beat drums and splashed water with their paddles to keep fish and evil spirits from eating his body. They also threw rice into the river to distract the fish but one night, the spirit of Qu Yuan appeared to his friends and told them that he had long passed, and that they should wrap the rice in silk packages to ward off the dragons that would consume them. These food packages became the famous \"zongzi\" and the racing of boats to find Qu's body, have become the cornerstone for the dragonboat tradition.\n\nGuo Moruo 's play has become a resounding success in the Chinese leftist literary world and the Nationalist Government has been quick to capitalise on its success by declaring that Qu was one of China's first great revolutionaries. While some socialists have dneounced the dragonboat festivals as pure superstitions, most writers do agree that Qu was a true leader of the people's revolution. His fidelity to his home country, his dedication to the people, and his works of art shall forever be immortalised for generations to come."

CHI.lategame.901.t: "A Republican Alliance?"
CHI.lategame.901.d: "When we initially signed an agreement with the Kuomintang, it was with the expressed intention to help topple the tyrannical Beiyang warlords and ensure the divided southern Chinese republican factions could stand up to their stronger northern counterparts. It seems that the left Kuomintang's Central Executive Committee has won that race, successfully conquering critical cities in their frenzied march northwards.\n\nOn the cusp of claiming national leadership, there are effectively two barriers in their way. One is the [716.owner.GetAdjectiveCap] presence in Manchuria. The other is us and our claims to a more democratic future. With the help of various intermediaries, primarily veterans of the old Guangdong Fourth Army, it seems that Wang is trying to drive a wedge between any potential Federalist-[716.owner.GetAdjectiveCap] alliance against him.\n\nInstead he has offered to reconstitute the old Constitutional Protection Alliance, with terms heavily favoured towards his camp. Leveraging the [CHI.GetName]'s apparent strength, in broad strokes he has offered to accept limited federalist principles and regional autonomy in exchange for the submission of our movement to the Kuomintang. His men have worked to stoke patriotic sentiment within our ranks, claiming that national unity to recover Manchuria is of the utmost importance.\n\nFaced with this difficult scenario, [ROOT.GetLeader] and his inner circle are forced to weigh their options carefully. Given the apparent instability of the Kuomintang government, it might be better to simply wait things out and find a better opportunity to resist. And if we are lucky, we will be able to nudge the party-state towards a more democratic end. On the other hand, if we wait too long our power can only wane, dooming China's hope for a more democratic future."

In exchange for some token recognition of regional autonomy and other democratic promises, [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to subordinate themselves to us in the name of securing Manchuria from foreign imperialists.\n\nThis is a major diplomatic coup for us, bringing the nation ever closer to national unification without firing a shot. We have prevented any potential alliance between the warlords of the northeast and the south, escaping the vise. Still, it remains to be seen whether or not this decision will be fully accepted within the Federalist movement.\n\nWithin our own camp, there has been plenty of dissention. Wang has craftily hidden behind the Reconstruction Faction, who are the most open in celebrating this outcome. Instead, he has tried to keep his hand hidden in these affairs, though that has not prevented many from being driven into the arms of the radicalised Provisional Action Committee. Wang makes it clear however to those who will listen that this deal is not one made lightly, and he only did it to help save his country. Having made his bed, he now must weather the storm ahead."

Rivals for well over a decade now, our offer of recognising some regional autonomy and local elections during the tutelage was soundly rejected by [FROM.GetLeader], who has expressed distrust for our ability to hold up our end of the bargain. Instead, he has accused us of trying to play off his movement against the gathering [716.owner.GetAdjectiveCap] presence in the northeast, hoping to send his men to a fiery death while we sit back and watch.\n\nThe failure of these talks is of no surprise. Wang Jingwei has craftily hidden behind the Reconstruction Faction, who were the most open proponents of such talks. Instead, he has tried to keep his hand hidden in these affairs, having learned his lesson from past conflicts over the thorny Federalist issue. With the National Revolutionary Government caught in a potential vise between the Northeastern warlords and the Southwestern ones, the Kuomintang has little choice but to toughen up and rout both if they are to proceed with national unification.

Moreover, he has denounced the [716.owner.GetAdjectiveCap] presence in Manchuria, calling it an extension of foreign imperialism and demanding its prompt return to Chinese rule.\n\nThere are plenty of concerns however within our own camp. [FROM.GetLeader] does not speak for all Federalists, and after looking at the terms it seems that they are heavily balanced in favour of the Kuomintang. He was not even given a seat in their Central Executive Committee, forced to settle for some representation in the Legislative Yuan, even though everyone knows actual decision-making power lies in the CEC.\n\nGiven their authoritarian, iconoclastic style of rule, there have been some calls to defy their encroaching rule.

Sun Fo and his centrist Reconstruction Faction has stepped into the void, publicly seeking to broker a reconcilation between the long warring Kuomintang factions.\n\nThe terms he has offered, ostensibly to protect civilian rule while moderating the revolutionary iconoclasm of the left, seek to be heavily stacked in favour of the [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] government. We would effectively be submitting our troops to their Military Affairs Commission while ruling autonomously in our own assigned military regions. Still, with patriotic sentiment at an all-time high, even within the [ROOT.GetRulingParty], it is very hard to turn down this chance to peacefully unite the nation. Perhaps at a later time we can push the party closer to our own vision for the future."
CHI.lategame.931.a: "For our nation and the party, we reluctantly accept."
CHI.lategame.931.b: "For the good of the republic and nation, we must decline!"

CHI.lategame.932.t: "The Kuomintang Rift Healed?"
CHI.lategame.932.d: "Thanks to a rising call for a united front against foreign imperialism, most notably championed by Sun Fo and the Reconstruction Faction, an extremely favourable \"Reconciliation\" has been struck with the Kuomintang rightists under [FROM.GetLeader]. In exchange for democratic promises and inclusion in our decision-making process, [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to subordinate themselves to us in the name of securing Manchuria from foreign imperialists.\n\nThis represents the enduring power of nationalism within our party and though the planned merger between our rival central committees will likely take time before it is implemented. For now, time must be taken to build trust and individual matters coordinated on a more ad-hoc basis.\n\nWithin our own camp, there has been plenty of dissention. The primary drivers of this agreement were the Reconstruction Faction, who have gone to the public to secure such an agreement. They have been silently backed by members of the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association, though their usual associates in the Provisional Action Committee have tried to distance themselves from the matter. This has not stopped them from losing ground among the left to Wang Jingwei's faction as well as radicals outside of the party who have gritted their teeth for the time being. In private, accusations of the revolution being \"sold out\" abound."
CHI.lategame.932.a: "The heirs of Dr. Sun rally!"

CHI.lategame.933.t: "Kuomintang Talks Reach an Impasse!"
CHI.lategame.933.d: "Despite very public calls for unity in face of imperialist aggression, including public activism by Sun Fo and his Reconstruction Faction, it seems that the perpetually divided Kuomintang have not been able to create an accord between the [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and [ROOT.Captial.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Kuomintang governments.\n\nOur rival splinter factions simply could not distance themselves from the bad blood that had accumulated over the years, with mutual assassinations, betrayals, and accusations of treason taking its toll on party unity. On the other hand, perhaps our goals were always mutually exclusive from one another, and these calls for unity were merely wishful thinking.\n\nIn any case, as we trade insults of being warlord reactionaries and socialist subversives, it seems that the prestige Whampoa has long reveled in has taken a blow. Although the Reconstruction Faction were the more public face of these talks, the officers of the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association were widely seen as the muscle behind negotiations and its failure reflects badly on them. Plenty now doubt their credentials as an impartial force, the non-partisan reputation Li Jishen has carefully cultivated now damaged. As the PAC distance themselves from their WMARCA allies, their retreat has been harried by a rising anti-establishment, radical wave even within the military's ranks."
CHI.lategame.933.a: "Party heretics cannot be trusted."

CHI.lategame.934.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Submits to [FROM.FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
CHI.lategame.934.d: "After some intense negotiations between [FROM.FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], it seems that the two rival governments have coalesced in the leftist Kuomintang splinter faction's favour. [FROM.GetLeader] has announced the merger of both central committees under a shared [CHI.GetName] banner, a move that reflects the waxing power of the socialist party-state.\n\nIn a speech, the former Chairman of the rightist faction has stated his desire to bring the nation closer to peaceful unification, and has touted the key concessions that he has wrought out of [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] in the process. Moreover, he has denounced the [716.owner.GetAdjectiveCap] presence in Manchuria, calling it an extension of foreign imperialism and demanding its prompt return to Chinese rule.\n\nThere are plenty of concerns however within our own camp. [FROM.GetLeader] was supposed to provide an alternative to socialism, checking its decades long contagion by the Internationale. This agreement can only serve to allow syndicalist influence to go unchecked within our borders, allowing for Red influence to expand its reach. Moreover, it seems that plans to merge the central executive committees has been delayed until after unification, further highlighting the right's apparent weakness.\n\nThere seems to be little word on whether or not we will even be included in these talks either, with [ROOT.GetLeader] treated as an afterthought in these discussions. On the other hand, with much of the old Kuomintang right folding into the Kuomintang government, we might have little choice but go along with it."
CHI.lategame.934.a: "The Kuomintang must remain united..."
CHI.lategame.934.b: "He has sold us out to the socialists!"

CHI.lategame.935.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts the Kuomintang Compromise!"
CHI.lategame.935.d: "After some examination of conscience, it seems that [FROM.GetLeader] and his government have elected to accede to the mainstream right Kuomintang line. This has brought [FROM.GetAdjective] forces under a shared Kuomintang banner and our government one step closer to national unification. The influx of reactionaries into our Legislative Yuan (with the possibility of them joining the Central Executive Committee after unification) has attacted some concerns of reactionary infiltration, but for now it seems the deal is holding."
CHI.lategame.935.a: "As they should..."

CHI.lategame.936.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Rebels Against the Kuomintang Compromise!"
CHI.lategame.936.d: "After some examination of conscience, it seems that [FROM.GetLeader] and his regionalist clique have elected to secede from the mainstream Kuomintang line. [FROM.GetAdjective] forces have begun to defy their old rightist comrades, making a harsh break from our rule and hopes for a more peaceful unification. They seemed to have hoped for a wide rebellion, but with the old right Kuomintang centre having already accepted the accord as fait accompli they thankfully seem to be on their own. Still, such a rebellion is a blow to the hopes of negotiators, and have proven detrimental to our own party's acceptance of such talks."
CHI.lategame.936.a: "We had a deal!"

CHI.endgame.001.d.song: "Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Republic of China announced a new direction in Chinese foreign policy. Citing the success of the Chinese National Revolution and the anti-imperialist stance of the Chinese Natinonalist Party - the Republic of China has officially declare its intention to work with new independent countries in Asia under the Sino-Pacific Friendship Association.\n\nThe planned direction of the association is to work with fellow emerging and socialist nations in Asia and Africa, to encourage economic development and national self sufficency in an emerging new world order where countries are now seeking distance away from both the Reichspakt and the Third Internationale."
CHI.endgame.001.d.wang: "Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Republic of China announced a new direction in Chinese foreign policy. Citing the success of the Chinese National Revolution and the anti-imperialist stance of the Chinese Nationalist Party - the Republic of China has officially declared to create its own \"Internationale\" in Asia.\n\nThe planned goals and direction of this Internationale is to provide economic and political aid to all Asian nations regardless of ideology and religion, so that Asian nations may partake in an emerging new world order in which newly freed countries may finally challenge the hegemony of the Entente and Reichspakt."
CHI.endgame.001.d.chen: "Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Republic of China announced a new direction in Chinese foreign policy. Citing the success of the Chinese National Revolution and the anti-imperialist stance of the Chinese Nationalist Party - the Republic of China has officially declared to create its own \"Internationale\" in Asia.\n\nFurthermore, Chairman [CHI.GetLeader] has also announced the creation of a \"Peoples' Minsheng Cooperative Economic Partnership\" to foster economic cooperation between the nations of Asia while also promoting the Three Principles' of the People. In a move drastically challenging the hegemony of the West, it would appear that the Asian nations are partaking in an emerging new world order."
CHI.endgame.001.d.hu: "Today the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Republic of China announced that the Chinese Government was going to pursue a hardline in international affairs and that the affairs of China and its surronding peripheries shall henceforth be managed by China itself.\n\nForeign observers have nicknamed this Chinese policy the Sinosphere, as Generalissimo [CHI.GetLeader] and the China Revival Society have indicated that they seek to pursue an ethno and ultranationalist direction in regard to their alignment in the world."

CHI.endgame.002.t: "An Invitation to join [FROM.GetFactionName]"
CHI.endgame.002.d: "This morning our ambassador welcomed the Chinese delegation from [CHI.GetNameDef] led by the Kuomintang Ambassador Chen Youren. The Chinese ambassador is well known throughout the Asia-Pacific region for his efforts in organising liberation and anti-colonial movements during the height of the Chinese National Revolution.\n\nThe ambassador expressed sincerely his hopes that we should work together with the Chinese Government in solidarity for the international anti-colonial revolution against foreign imperialism. Our resources will be shared and our miltiary forces will actively work together in joint military exercises in order to strengthen our Pan-Asian cooperaiton.\n\nWhile there are certainly those within our government who support such a decision, there are also others who are suspcious of Chinese intentions and worry that we will merely find ourselves lackeys or puppets in their new order in Asia."
CHI.endgame.002.a: "Together for Pan-Asianism!"
CHI.endgame.002.b: "No, we have nothing to gain from that!"

CHI.endgame.003.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Joins Us!"
CHI.endgame.003.d: "It would appear that Ambassador Chen has once again accomplished a remarkable feat of diplomatic success as he has managed to convince [FROM.GetNameDef] to work with us and partake in the graeter international struggle and revolution against foreign imperialism. Let us hope that this relationship with [FROM.GetNameDef] shall prove to last the ends of timne, as we resolutely declare war on all foreign imperialists - for a free Asia!"
CHI.endgame.003.a: "Together, we are strong!"

CHI.endgame.004.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Declines Our Invitation"
CHI.endgame.004.d: "Unfortunately despite his best efforts, it would appear that Ambassador Chen has failed in convincing [FROM.GetNameDef] to partake in our shared anti-imperialist struggle. It seems that the people of [FROM.GetNameDef] have either assumed the worst of our intentions or that they simply do not take our strength seriously. They have chosen to stand alone without our protection and leadership, a risk that they have brought upon themselves."
CHI.endgame.004.a: "Their loss."

CHI.endgame.005.t: "The Afro-Asian Conference"
CHI.endgame.005.nomafcollapse.d: "The old world order of the Kaiserreich has been challenged since the collapse of the capitalist global economy as an aftermath of Black Monday. In Asia, [GER.GetNameDef]'s economic collapse sent ripples through the colonial world with the Indochina Rising in 1936 as well as the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces. The recent completion of the Northern Expedition as well as the War of Resistance has solidified [CHI.GetNameDef] as the first nation in Asia to successfully vanquish the forces of imperialism.\n\nAs a result [CHI.GetLeader] and the Kuomintang's Foreign Ministry have decided to organise an Afro-Asian Conference of leaders and ambassadors of the developing world to gather and discuss the new growing political shifts. While the African nations have yet to achieve their independence from the Germans, the Chinese are more than happy to welcome African revolutionaries as revolutionary comrades in the greater international war against imperialism.\n\nDelegates at the conference have decided to ratify and acknowledge key principles of governing a post-colonial Afro-Asian world which includes establishing goodwill with all members of the conference, to examine social and cultural problems, and to enhance the international visability of the developing world to the international community. A new era is dawning over Asia, and the Chinese nation under [CHI.GetLeader] is more than happy to play an active role in promoting a shared future for the developing world."

CHI.endgame.006.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Offers Investment"
CHI.endgame.006.d: "This morning, we have received news from the ambassador of [FROM.GetNameDef] that their country is seeking to invest in our new young nation. We have just recently won and secured our independence, however our industrial and capital base is lacking compared to the rest of the industrial nations of the world. [FROM.GetNameDef] has offered to invest in our nation so that we may be able to accelerate the process of industrialisation and as a means for us to resist the capitalistic tendencies of the imperial nations. However, there are some in our government who oppose such measures as this may create unwanted influence of [FROM.GetNameDef] and may very well just be a means of their country trying to take advantage of our young nation."
CHI.endgame.006.a: "We graciously accept."
CHI.endgame.006.b: "We politely decline."

CHI.endgame.007.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Investment"
CHI.endgame.007.d: "We have received great news from our ambassador to [FROM.GetNameDef] that their country has accepted our investment oppurtunities. Together, we will be able to grow in economic strength and help them develop into a new rising power while also aiding our industrial and recovery efforts. May this be the start of a long and fruitful friendship for the years to come!."
CHI.endgame.007.a: "The start of a fruitful partnership."

CHI.endgame.008.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Spurns Investment"
CHI.endgame.008.d: "We have received disappointing news from our ambassador to [FROM.GetNameDef] that they are unwilling to accept our investment opportunity and have turned down our gracious offer. Perhaps they view our grateful outreach as a foreign threat or simply that they do not trust that what we seek is a mutually beneficial relationship for both of our nations. Whether their reasons may be, it's their loss that they have turned down our generous offer."
CHI.endgame.008.a: "Regardless, we wish them luck. They'll need it."

CHI.endgame.009.t: "China seeks to join the Internationale"
CHI.endgame.009.d: "Our relationship with the Chinese Kuomintang goes back to the 1924 Reorganisation of their party when we approached the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen to work with the KMT, as we see the Kuomintang movement as the only one in which a socialist China can emerge. We helped train their revolutionary army at Whampoa and most of all, we took in the Kuomintang exiles such as Wang Jingwei following the collapse of the First Northern Expedition.\n\nNow many years later, our investment in the Kuomintang has bore fruit as the Kuomintang has succeeded in unifying China under the socialist creed and has now approached us to join the Internationale. Citing their commitment to help others secure liberation in the world revolution as well as their desire to help us oversee the destruction of the German world order, they have asked to formally be invited to the Third Internationale. While we are more than happy to accept cooperation with our Chinese comrades, a minority within our  government who are suspcious of the Kuomintang's \"Party State\" ideals and have warned against working with them."
CHI.endgame.009.a: "Together we shall free the world!"
CHI.endgame.009.b: "They are far too unorthodox for our taste."

CHI.endgame.010.t: "China Joins the Internationale!"
CHI.endgame.010.d: "Our application to join the Internationale has proven to be a success! For years, we have owed much to the Third Internationale for their support, recognition, and aid in helping organise and funding the Kuomintang so that we may liberate China from the warlords and imperialists that oppressed our dear country. With our revolution finally successful, it is due time that we repay years of gratituity to the Internationale and aid in the world revolution against the capitalist and imperialist world order of [GER.GetNameDef]. Together, the Internationale shall unite the human race and we will strive forward for mankind's socialist progress forevermore!"
CHI.endgame.010.a: "Together we complete the world revolution!"

CHI.endgame.011.t: "Our Application Denied."
CHI.endgame.011.d: "Despite our desire to cooperate with the Third Internatinoale, unfortunately - they have denied our application to join their global revolution. Citing our ideological differences from orthdox syndicalism amongst other differences, the Internationale has formally rejected our application to join them. While this is certainly frustrating given our once close relationship with the Third Internationale, it proves to many of us that no matter what ideology - the West merely seeks to work with China for its own benefit and does not really seek to establish an equal relationship. Whether capitalist or socialist, it is quite clear to us that the West is still guided by the mindset of imperialism."
CHI.endgame.011.a: "Imperialists can never change their stripes."

CHI.endgame.012.t: "We are invited to join the PMCEP"
CHI.endgame.012.d: "Following their announcement of a new direction in foreign policy and international commerce, [FROM.GetNameDef] has announced the ceration of the \"Peoples' Minsheng Cooperative Economic Partnrship\". Dedicated to combatting the oppressive regimes of capitalism while also providing an adequate means for young Asian countries to modernise in countries without sufficient industrialisation, the PMCEP aims to bind the nations of Asia together in an economic cooperative led by the Chinese nation. While there are many in our government who support this iniative and believe that this will benefit our economy tremendously - there are also those who view this so-called cooperation as an act of imperialism by the Chinese; since after all it is organised and centred around Chinese leadership."
CHI.endgame.012.a: "A toast to our Chinese comrades!"
CHI.endgame.012.b: "How about, no."

CHI.endgame.013.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] joins the PMCEP"
CHI.endgame.013.d: "We have received news from the ambassador of [FROM.GetNameDef] that their country is happy to announce their decision to join the People's Minsheng Cooperative Economic Partnership. We applaud them for their wise decision and we look forward to working hand in hand with our comrades in establishing an Asia free of imperialism."
CHI.endgame.013.a: "Long live anti-imperialism!"

CHI.endgame.014.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Rejects PMCEP Membership"
CHI.endgame.014.d: "We have received news from the ambassador of [FROM.GetNameDef] that their country is unwilling to join the People's Minsheng Cooperative Economic Partnership. Perhaps believing that we have other nefarious ideas for our shared cooperation or that we will not distribute resources evenly, they have declined to partake in the greater anti-colonial struggle. While it is certainly disappering to hear this, they will regret this decision as they fall victim to capitalism and imperialism. Only through pan-Asian cooperation will the oppressed peoples be able to work togther."
CHI.endgame.014.a: "A shame."

CHI.endgame.041.t: "Return of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea"
CHI.endgame.041.d: "As a result of the Japanese occupation of their country, various Korean guerilla armies proliferated in Manchuria, northern Korea, and the Chinese mainland throughout the 1920s. Having received military and economic support from the sympathetic Chinese Kuomintang, the leftist faction of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea appears to dominate the political scene of the newly independent revolutionary Korea.\nThe leftist faction of the PGROK led by Kim Wonbong, a Korean revolutionary in exile and Whampoa graduate, has been stationed in Shanghai since 1935. His faction, the so-called Korean National Revolutionary Party shares many political values and facets with the Chinese Kuomintang and has essentially acted as its sister party within the potential Korean state. Now with the Chinese victory over the Japanese in the Second Sino-Japanese War, Wonbong has officially handed his resignation as a general of the National Revolutionary Army to oversee and administer the newly liberated Republic of Korea."
CHI.endgame.041.a: "Wonderful."

CHI.endgame.042.t: "Malaysian Volunteers Go Home"
CHI.endgame.042.d: "When our forces first took control of Malaysian territories, we were able to strike deals with native revolutionaries sympathetic to our anti-imperialist goals. Various freedom-fighters joined the swelling ranks of the Three Stars Army, helping us drive out all those who would oppress our Malaysian brothers.\n\nWith the war won, we have honored our promises and sponsored the formation of [MAL.GetNameDef]. The core of the army of this newly independent state will likely be made up of veterans of the old Three Star Army, trained by our officers and equiped with our arms. We can only hope that this will ensure close ties for years to come, as a new dawn shines on a free Asia."
CHI.endgame.042.a: "Farewell comrades!"

CHI.endgame.043.t: "The Union Assembly of Papua and New Guinea"
CHI.endgame.043.d: "Following the liberation of Papua and New Guinea, a provisional parliament has been set up in the city of Port Moresby. Hundreds of delegates have been assembled at the \"Union Assembly of Papua and New Guinea\", colloquially referred to as of the Gung (the Council). The educated class among the native peoples of the islands is small and political consciousness almost nonexistent. Unlike in many other colonies where the Europeans had tried to uplift the natives and Westernise them, the native intelligentsia of Papua and New Guinea appear to be mostly limited to attendees of Christian missionary schools and a few mixed race activists who attended modern European universities.\n\nWe have found a willing figurehead for the provisional government, a former trade unionist by the name of Sumsuma. He gained great renown for founding the modern Papuan and New Guinean labour movements in 1929, when he led a major strike in the former German colonial capital of Rabaul. Sumsuma was imprisoned for his actions and even after his release he was forced to keep a low profile, retiring to his home on the island of Boang, one of the northern Tanga Islands.\n\nWhen the colonial rulers of New Guinea were pushed into retreat, he was elected King among the Tanga people and leveraged this position to try to form a new political movement. By the time our troops marched into Port Moresby and Lae, the name \"Sumsuma\" was already being spoken of with great reverence and he had apparently managed to coalesce his following into an organisation which he has dubbed the \"Committee of Thirteen\".\n\nThis Committee is the first native political party in the former colony and has actively been promoting what it calls a \"National Union\" between all ethnic groups and races of the islands. Owing to Sumsuma's background as a trade unionist and one of the more politically active native New Guineans, him and his comrades have been receptive to our anti-imperialist rhetoric. He does not actually seem to know much about socialism or the broader anti-colonial struggle, but even if his beliefs about workers rights, democracy and national liberation are quite vulgar and unhoned, he is still the best figure we have to coalesce our hold over Papua and New Guinea."
CHI.endgame.043.a: "Best of luck to them!"

CHI.endgame.044.t: "Singapore under the Chinese"
CHI.endgame.044.d: "With the liberation of the Malay peninsula complete, the CRS has begun establishing occupational zones and fostering local support among the East Asian population. Of particular note are two regions that have been carved out as exceptions from the broader occupation policy, Singapore and Penang. The former due to its status as the most developed city in the Malay archipelago and a strategic military outpost, the latter due to its large Chinese population and historical importance for the Kuomintang. Penang Island was traded to the British in the 1700s by a local Malay Sultan, it was later settled by Hokkien merchants and coolies who were sent there to toil for their British masters, cultivating a distinct overseas Chinese culture with long-running roots in the region. Our Penang cousins funded and supported the Kuomintang and its precursors since before the days of Xinhai, the island was even once home and refuge to the great Sun Yat-sen during his exile in the 1910s. Singapore too is also home to an immense overseas Chinese population, numbering at around 50%-60% of its inhabitants, though not all of these necessarily identify with our own government policies of Pan-Chinese solidarity. As Singapore and Penang are both around 5000 kilometers away from China proper, to govern them will be an immense task for the government in (Chinese capital).\n\nThough we can rely on the infrastructure of our liberated allies and advancements in telecommunications to speed up the process, it is clear that both regions will require the creation of autonomous municipal governments to fulfil their functions as outposts to spread and defend the Asian Revolution.\n\nThe solution has been the proposal of \"Tebie Xingzhengqu\" (Special Administrative Regions), which will have local governments drawn from the native overseas Chinese populations, as well as receive \"Zhengzhi Zhidao\" (Political Guidance) from the (Chinese capital) appointed executives of regional Government Bureaus. This hybrid system has been proposed as something of a temporary measure, as evident by its name "Linshi Xingzheng Weiyuan" (Temporary Executive Committee". Its efficiency will have to be put to the test lest more extreme solutions be required to maintain the \"revolutionary outposts\"."
CHI.endgame.044.a: "A new era for a new Singapore."

CHI.endgame.050.t: "The Final Victory Over Imperialism"
CHI.endgame.050.d: "For centuries, the winds of the great seas of the Nanhai and the Pacific blew to the Middle Kingdom - paying tribute to the great civilisation-state of China. The winds of fate also allowed tens of thousands of Chinese expatriates to seek new fortunes and homes across Asia - building diasporic communities in Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, and Thailand - everywhere they went, connecting Chinese people far and wide despite regional and cultural differences. Truly, China's place in the world is in Asia.\n\nFor the last century however, this has not been the case. We have been humilaited utterly not only by the Western imperialists who tore apart the nations of the East under their banner of colonialism but also against the Japanese wokou who took advantage of our decaying state to pursue their own imperialistic ambitions. In our absence, the ever-burning cultural hearth of East Asia seemed to dim out and darkness covered our what was once maritime bliss.\n\nNow, things are different. The Chinese Kuomintang has led the Chinese peoples to pursue their salvation from imperialism and in doing so - were able to proclaim the Republic of China, a new revolutionary and socialist Republic free of imperialist influences. It is with this strength that the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Chinese Republic have been able to liberate and free thousands of our fellow Asian comrades across Southeast Asia. We have even been able to bring the revolution to the far icy reaches of Outer Manchuria, and our forces were able to liberate the Japanese workers from the chains of their tyrannical empire.\n\nIt does not end here. China's reinvigorated strength, China's glorious history, and China's prestige calls for it to play an even larger role in the world. Only China is capable of bringing together the vast Asian peoples under the banner of Pan-Asian anti-imperialism, and it does not stop there. We have created a zone of security stretching from Honolulu to Melbourne and covering every nation from the Pacific Island chains to India. Let the world see and rejoice, for the nightmare and darkness of imperialism has faded away and the White Sun of the East rises forth - shining all of the world under its brilliance forevermore!"

##Section 4b (200-399): Wang Endgame Events

#Wang Introduction Event Chain (200-219)
CHI.endgame.201.t: "The Three Faces of Wang Jingwei"
CHI.endgame.201.d: "The birthright is now unquestionably his. Since the death of the beloved late eternal premier Dr. Sun, the Chairman has found his birthright contested by power-hungry leaders such as Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Hanmin. When the Kuomintang returned to China and helped complete the Second Northern Expedition, the Bonapartist Deng Yanda and the bitter widow Song Qingling attempted to oust the Chairman from his rightful birthright of Party leadership.\n\nIt has been achieved and the spoils are being divided between the once united clique of followers behind the Chairman. The Residence Faction is currently dominant, as they have long had the eyes and ears of the Chairman due to their unquestionable leader being none other than the Chairman's beloved wife - Chen Bijun. They have gotten to work at once by appointing members of Wang's family to leadership positions in the Executive Yuan - a move denounced as nepotism by members of the Reorganised Comrades Association. Governorship posts have also been passed around members of the Residence Faction, to which Chen Gongbo has remarked bitterly to the Chairman that he is feeling sidelined.\n\nNonetheless, the radicals are still a dominant force as the RCA controls much of the Legislative Yuan, and the RCA continues to lie dominated by its Radical Faction. Maintaining control of the RCA while it is dominated by the Radicals continues to be a struggle between Chen Gongbo and Gu Mengyu, both men representing the Radical and Moderate wings respectively. However, with Chen Bijun's ambitions as high as ever, both men worry that the RCA's hold on the government might be getting weaker daily.\n\nChen Gongbo had been temporarily appointed as Premier of the Executive Yuan, though his position grows less and less secure by the day. A final appointment is expected soon, and Chen faces challengers in Gu Mengyu and long-time Wang secretary Zeng Zhongming. Wang's final choice will likely be a momentous one in Chinese history."
CHI.endgame.201.a: "Time to fight over the spoils..."

CHI.endgame.202.t: "A Nation's Lament"
CHI.endgame.202.d: "Despite having secured leadership of the Party and maintaining his position as de facto Chairman of the Kuomintang, there have recently been a large series of protests by supporters of the Provisional Action Committee within the city as well as intellectuals and students. Strikes and protests have broken out in several large Chinese cities, denouncing Wang's political moves as dictatorial and illegitimate. \n\nWithin the Kuomintang, party members formerly associated with the PAC, have also decried Wang's political conquests as well as the moves from the Residence Faction to staff the national bureaucracy. They have issued calls for Wang to step down after years of leadership but their cries for change have fallen on deaf ears due to the dominance the RCA holds within the Party. Yet it is clearly evident, that Wang's consolidation of power has certainly agitated the peoples. As long as the strikes and unrest continue, Wang's position of power will certainly be troubled and dissatisfaction within the RCA and the Residence Faction may grow as a result. If faith is to be restored in the Chinese Nationalist Party, the Chairman must act quickly to subdue unrest and to prove that he is worthy of carrying the mantle of Dr. Sun Yat-sen once and for all."
CHI.endgame.202.a: "The days of sorrow continue..."

CHI.endgame.203.t: "A Hollowed Army"
CHI.endgame.203.d: "In their reports back to Paris and London, members of the Internationale Military Mission to China often described the factionalism of the Kuomintang as one between the \"civilian wing\" of the Reorganised Comrades Association and that of the \"military wing\"of the Provisional Action Committee. The military of the revived National Revolutionary Army in the MinGan Insurgency was largely dominated by officers and generals loyal to Deng Yanda's Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association. Furthermore, many of them engaged in the revolution in the MinGan zone for years, while the RCA and the Chairman stayed in exile.\n\nThere was also the India Clique within the National Revolutionary Army that is largely sympathetic to the ideals of PAC (many of them are indeed dear comrades of PAC officers) and the Reconstruction Faction of Sun Fo. The Chairman has denounced militarism within party politics, declaring that the military must be completely subordinated to the Party. He has ordered that while the military may be responsible for operational decisions, all administrative decisions must be completely handled by the Party.\n\nDue to the RCA's own influence within the Political Department of the NRA, the Chairman has ordered that the Political Department at once be expanded in order to encourage political indoctrination and to win complete loyalty of the army. Means of indoctrination and awarenes of the mass movement, would encourage the army to understand that they were merely servants to the Chinese people in the revolution and not a separate entity.\n\nHowever, these efforts have not helped rectify the state of the army. Those who have survived the purge, have kept their heads down and the army as a whole remains bitterly demoralised. Until the Chairman takes steps to resolve and to reform the army, the NRA is effectively a shell of its wartime self."

#Wang Focus Tree Events (240-259)
CHI.endgame.241.t: "Three Approaches to Land Reform"
CHI.endgame.241.d: "Feudalism as long been defined by political intellectuals and leaders within the Reorganised Comrades Association as the system in which the subsistence economy of China plays a dominant role in Chinese society. This system is one of inherent injustice as the landlords use political force to occupy the land and to exploit the epasants by plundering their products and forcing them to do free labour; in which the occupation of the land by landlords led to the total monopoly of political, military, and economic power. It is true that the coastal cities have already entered the capitalist stage but nonetheless, the backward northwestern, southwestern, and rural areas of China still belong to the feudal stage - feudalism is still the dominant force in China. Since 70% of China's population are still bound to a feudal society, it is the role of the Party to step in and to liberate them from their archaic oppression.\n\nMost in the Reorganised Comrades Association favour an aggressive approach of government nationalisation while also seeking to enforce fair land reform (although not for large landlords, warlords, or other local bullies). The lands of warlords, local tyrants, corrupt officials, and evil gentry are to be confiscated and that land is not to be sold or bought in private. Meanwhile, the moderates have advocated for a more orthodox approach of land reform  - seeking instead to reform land on the basis of land to the tiller.\n\nHowever within the RCA-Radicals, there are definitely those such as Shi Cuntong who have advocated for total land reform, seeking to uphend the social order by encouraging peasant uprisings and seeking to complete nationalise all land to the government."

CHI.endgame.242.t: "Loyalty Tests the New Army"
CHI.endgame.242.d: "As part of the new official party policy, the Chairman has formally subordinated the army under the Party- placing all administrative military decisions under his control effectively. Left unopposed by the Kuomintang's Central Committee - this move has been quickly approved and passed into formal law. Henceforth, administrative decisions such as the mobilisation of troops can only be approved by the Party Central - and those who refused to obey were to be at once arrested by their subordinates. Meanwhile, the Political Department has gotten to work through lectures and other means of political indoctrination, to help weed out those who will continue to be loyal to the Party and those who have to be purged.\n\nThe Political Department by orders of the Chairman has formally authorised the \"Moral Cultivation Movement.\" All soldiers and officers are to be drawn from the producer class - that is those of the oppressed classes (in Wang's definitions, this constitutes the petite bourgeoise, the students, intellectuals, workers, and peasants). Furthermore, military members are taught daily that their function is to serve the people but also that the people should be taught that the soldiers are a producer class just like them. Soldiers are given only modest living conditions and harsh training so that the people can see that the soldiers are not living a life of luxary unbeknownst to them. If the peoples' rights are wronged by the Army, the Army is to respond immeditaely at once and offer through investigations to prove the army's subservience to the Chinese people.\n\nA few officers who had rebelled against Wang's leadership such as General Ye Ting, have asked that their commissions be formally reinstated and have promised to swear loyalty to the new regime. While the Chairman is certainly merciful and generous, the Residence Faction and the Radicals of the RCA have advocated for a harsh stance towards all who had opposed his leadership.

CHI.endgame.243.t: "The Chairman and His Shattered Party"
CHI.endgame.243.d: "Was this how it was supposed to end? True, tensions had been simmering between the triumvirate of Hu Hanmin, Wang Jingwei, and Chiang Kai-shek during the Northern Expedition but since the collapse of the Northern Expedition - the Party has yet to splinter as much as it had during the Third Congress. Now, it is up to the Chairman to pick up the pieces of the shattered White Sun and to deal with the anti-revolutionary former Provision Action Committee.\n\nSong Qingling has since been placed under house arrest. Her position as the widow of Dr. Sun Yat-sen has made her virtually untouchable despite being heavily associated with the Provisional Action Committee. With the widow silenced, many of PAC's leaders have been expelled from the Central Executive Committee and the Executive Yuan. The Four Elders have been effectively quieted and have chosen to retire from politics while the Reconstruction Faction has mostly been thoroughly purged. Several however have been kept around such as Sun Fo, at the urging of the Moderates of the RCA who believe that Sun Fo's presence is needed to provide party legitimacy.\n\nThose within the Radical Faction of the RCA have argued that a new revolutionary leadership is needed within the Party to restore unity and cohesion. The radicals have urged for the creation of a new leadership staffed with members from the Chinese syndicalists and their own ranks. This is contrasted with pleads for leniency and even amnesty for those within PAC who may potentially be willing to participate in the Chairman's newly reorganised government."

CHI.endgame.244.t: "Intrigues in the CSP"
CHI.endgame.244.d: "The Leargue of Chinese Syndicalists has finally come undone as the various socialist factions over the league have finally broken their long-standing shaky alliance in favour of siding with either the PAC or the RCA. In the chaos of the Kuomintang's Third Congress, the World Society had denounced Chairman Wang and had attempted to help the PAC dismantle the revolution. While the Residence Faciton and the Reorganised Comrades Association had banded together with their syndicalist allies to help restore order and unity through the Party -there is certainly much to consider when it comes to the future of interparty cooperation between both the now emergent Chinese Syndicalist Party and the Kuomintang.\n\nThe Radical Faction of the Chinese Syndicalist Party holds long standing ties with the Radicals of the Reorganised Comrades Association. After all, some of the founding members of the Chinese Syndicalist Party such as Chen Gongbo and Shi Cuntong now hold prominent positions within the Kuomintang. While members of the Radical Faction and Orthodox Faction had agreed on the notion of \"no class difference\" during the United Front policy of the Second Northern Expedition - their tone and rhetoric have escalated since the unification. Now, radicals such as Qu Qibai and Cai Hsen are arguing in favour of a revolutionary class of intellectuals and leaders to lead the peasants to revolutionary freedom; and they have found a willing voice in their fellow Marxists within the RCA-Radicals.\n\nThe Orthodox Faction, meanwhile, under Li Lisan and Chen Duxiu, have been courted by the Moderates of the RCA, due to their willingness to forego notions of class struggle in favour of revolution for the oppressed classes. Members of the Moderates seek public opinion over the revolutionary organisational methods of the radicals, and thus they seek a potential ally in the Orthodox Faction of the CSP.\n\nThere are also those within the Residence Faction such as Chen Bijun who believe that the alliance with the Syndicalists no longer needs to be as intimaiate as the Second Northern Expedition. To them, the revolution has already been won and further attempts to cater to the Chinese syndicalists would merely subvert the true leadership of Chairman Wang and furthermore - dilute the ideology of Dr. Sun."

CHI.endgame.244.c: "The LCS has played their part..."

CHI.endgame.245.t: "The Reorganised Hierarchy"
CHI.endgame.245.d: "Organisation is the key to success according to members of the RCA-Radicals, who believe that a truly educated revolutionary vanguard must be organised well in order to lead the National Revolution for the Workers and Peasants. Thanks to the dominance of the Radical wing of the RCA, the RCA has enforced its highly rigid means of organisation upon the entire Party.\n\nThe headquarters of the RCA and Chen Gongbo's main centre of operations is the \"United Office of Provinical, Municipal, and Overseas Party Branches\" - allowing Premier Chen to monitor and manage RCA activities within the country and overseas. It is further supplemented by the \"Chinese Kuomintang Party Defending Revolutionary Alliance\", an RCA organisation created in secret in Shanghai in order to win over the support of the Chinese socialists and syndicalists.\n\nNew membership to the RCA is a highly arduous process. A prospective member of the RCA could only be considered for membership provided that he knew at least two other RCA members. Following a probation period of one to three months, he would become a full member only if approved by the next level of hierarchy. RCA members are organised in cells of three to nine men, and the hierarchy is graded into sub-branches, sub-districts, districts, provincial levels, and national levels.\n\nAt the encouragement of the Radicals, a tight enforcement line is administered of the RCA in order to protect the unity of the Party. Meetings of local RCA cells are to be held every week and attendance is mandatory. All decisions from the Premier are to be assumed to be instructions from the great Chairman and thus must be obeyed no matter what. Mid-level to higher level members are encouraged to keep reports on individual members such as a report of their whereabouts, report on their residences, and a weekly activity report.\n\nFurthermore, the training programme of the RCA stresses that members are to follow a single unified ideology, to maintain stringent discipline, to obey the RCA rather than individuals, and to work with the masses. Nonetheless, the Moderates have petitioned the Premier to relax these standards, arguing that without the PAC - there is no longer a need to maintian such strict control of the clique. They fear such a harsh system will soon be extended to the entire party."

CHI.endgame.246.t: "The First Family"
CHI.endgame.246.d: "Like the Guofu, the Chairman has been blessed with a great family but with their position secured the \"first family\" of the Chairman continues to attract media curiosity throughout the country. Chen Bijun, his dear wife, has often attracted tabloid speculation due to her perceived \"ugliness\" and older age (despite Wang being her senior by ten years). Even Wang's inner circle like Chen Gongbo do not dare refer to Chen Bijun by her maiden name, lest they find themselves chastised by Madame Wang that even Dr. Sun did not call her address her that way. Chen Gongbo and others have frequently grumbled at the amount of power Madame Wang seems to hold, but Wang has said that \"she is my revolutionary comrade, for that reason I don't find it easy to make decisions without considering her views.\"\n\nAs for his children, Wang's eldest son Wang Weying was born in France in 1913 and studied economics there before ostensibly starting his career as an apparatchik as a military supply official. A playboy, he is known for his lavish spending and rarely participates in politics. Wang's eldest daughter Wang Wenxing has been known to hold sympathies for Song Qingling and has publicly denounced her father for dividing the Party. His second daughter Wang Wenbin is also known to privately harbor views against the RCA but she is studying to become a nurse rather than engage in party politics.\n\nWang's third daughter is his most beloved of his daughters, Wang Wenxun. Born in 1922 and renowned for her beauty and intellect, she is currently serving as her father's secretary and is a member of the Residence Faction. Finally, his favourite son is also is youngest, Wang Wenti, born in 1928. Too young to participate in politics, his father has spoken of his desire to see him follow in his footsteps one day.\n\nMadame Wang has also been eagerly staffing the national bureaucracy with Wang's outer family and her own family since the PAC have been driven from the Party. The Wangs, Chens, and the Zengs (Premier Zeng Zhongming and his sister) have joined the Sun-Song clan as the \"Four Great Families of the Republic\", though many RCA members have denounced this as mere nepotism and have urged the Chairman to focus on political merit rather than family ties."

CHI.endgame.246.b: "But we serve the nation!"

CHI.endgame.247.t: "Wang Jingwei's Theory of Democracy"
CHI.endgame.247.d: "While most have catagorised the RCA as authoritarian, the Chairman himself has shown great interest in promoting the cause of democracy - creating what can only be considered a synthesis of the dangguo (party-state) and local self government. In fact, due to his courtship of the RCA-moderates, some within the RCA have even accused the Chairman of placing the issue of Minquan above the other three principles. Wang believes that without democratic forces, the principles of Minzu and Minsheng cannot be fully realised - as such it is imperative that the National Revolution ends in democracy.\n\nDemocracy in Wang's theory should be separate from the bourgeoise democracy of the West (such as in the United States and the German Empire) but also distinct from the proletariatan democracy of the syndicalist nations. In his writings and lectures, the Chairman has written extensively on the idea of the party-state as being necessary for nurturing the growth of democracy. During the era of revolution, the Party plays an effective role in dispelling anti-revolutionaries and furthermore that Party-rule is needed to help administer local self-governments. After all, without the guidance of the Kuomintang - how can one expect the masses to realise their revolutionary potential. Furthermore, the people of China are used to autocratic rule and they would not be used to exercising their four basic rights if there is no Party to guide to them.\n\nMembers of the Moderate Faction of the Reorganised Comrades Association have supported Wang's theories as factual. They argue that indeed in the time of revolution, a class of exceptional individuals like the Chairman must constitute the vanguard to constrain populism and to help the masses achieve consciousness. However, liberal factions within the Kuomintang have argued against Wang's policies and these outer parties have pushed for Wang to conclude the period of tutelage. To them, with the conclusion of the Second Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance - there is no longer much need to hold on to the ideas of party rule."

CHI.endgame.248.t: "Building a National Mausoleum"
CHI.endgame.248.d: "The National Mausoleum built to house the remains of the beloved Guofu is nearing completion with the project advancing far ahead of schedule. Crowds gathered at the foot of the Purple Mountain where the mausoleum is built as Wang Jingwei and his family as well as leading members of the RCA marched up the grand steps to honor the Guofu (whose coffin had returned from [GetVictoryPointName_9843] to lay to rest in eternal bliss in marble slate.\n\nTo say that the cult of Sun Yat-sen is important to the Wang Jingwei regime of the Kuomintang is merely an understatement. An anonymous RCA member has written in one of the Party's newspapers that \"In the history of the Chinese Revolution, Mr. Wang is the longest serving follow of Sun Yat-sen and we can say that only Mr. Wang is able to continue the revolutionary task of the late premier.\" The Chairman has officially declared dates important to Sun such as his birthdate, his deathdate, etc as national holidays and bronze statues of Sun are to be set up all around Nanjing. Furthermore Wang is frequently photographed or seen around in Nanjing - a testament to carrying out the late premier's will at the first republican capital.\n\nFurthermore, in an attempt to further draw his regime closer to the legacy of Dr. Sun, Wang has personally ordered Sun's entrails (which had been preserved and kept in [GetVictoryPointName_9843]) to be sent to Nanjing as to physically reconstitute Sun's body. While this move may be seen as grotesque, for Wang having the eternal premier's physical remains buried in Nanjing - seeks to legitimise his rightful leadership of the Party."

CHI.endgame.261.t: "The Expanded Party Conference"
CHI.endgame.261.d: "Emboldened by his successful negotiations with the Federalist movement, Wang Jingwei confidently strides forward in consolidating his reputation as a republican statesman - officially hosting an \"Expanded Party Conference\" with the intention of addressing unresolved issues from the Third Repatriated National Congress. He has cordially invited the Federalist leadership, most notably the Public Interest Party and their allies in the Chinese Democratic League to the Conference, asking them for their input on the future of the nation.\n\nThey were shocked however, to find that Wang was far more cunning then they expected. The PIP and CDL were hardly the only ones invited, with the KMT being joined not only the LCS (now dominated by the CSP), but also various representatives from the Kuomintang's right and Feng Yuxiang's Guominjun. Various smaller parties and independents were also included (almost definitely \"vetted\" by the secret police). In a cruel twist of fate, Wang has manipulated the Federalists' demands for greater pluralism against them - diluting their influence with a deluge of smaller, competing factions that the wily Chairman can more easily control.\n\nWith few options but to accept the terms laid out by the Kuomintang (who still control a majority of both the provisional Legislative Yuan and planned National Assembly anyhow), the Federalists can do little but nod along and try and shepard the various \"third parties\" they can find. In the meanwhile, Wang consolidates his grip over the nation with flair - giving a series of bombastic addresses to the Conference exhorting unity. He has decided to leave managing the practical discussions on the finer points of policy to his Premier Gu Mengyu. As long as a masterful political operator like Wang remains at the helm, the Kuomintang will continue to pit their \"partners\" against one another."

#Wang Epilogue Events (300-319)
CHI.endgame.301.t: "Founding Fathers of a Reborn Nation"
CHI.endgame.301.d: "Like a tree, the Party is a living organism - it must be nurtured and watered repeatedly so that the Party can perform its true functions and lead the masses to achieve a modern and democratic society. The Second Reorganisation of the Party led by the Reorganised Comrades Association has been successfully undertaken, with the bourgeoisie and degenerate elements of the party eliminated. Truly now, the Chairman can effectively run the party without interference from corrupt elements. While Wang has distanced himself from the RCA, it's clear that the RCA is dominated by those within its ranks who adhere to a more particular understanding of the sanminzhuyi. To them, history is materialistic; dare they might say that Dr. Sun's theory was grounded in materialism and that there is a sense of class within the semi-feudal world of China.\n\nThere exists little to no distinction between the RCA organisation and clique and the actual party of the Kuomintang as many aspects of RCA organisation and leadership have been passed by the Chairman at the encouragement of his premier, Chen Gongbo. Nicknamed the Chairman's \"right-hand\", some say the relationship between Chen and Wang lies in Chen's ambitions to influence the Kuomintang. Still, there is no denying Chen's absolute loyalty to the Chairman. Premier Chen has helped restore order throughout the country as the WMARCA has been thoroughly subdued, the CRS radicals purged, and Song Qingling has willingly resigned from politics and chosen a quiet retirement.\n\nAround the country, the young boys and girls of China read in their history books - the glorious deeds of China's great revolutionary heroes: Sun Yat-sen, Liao Zhongkai, Wang Jingwei, and of course, Chen Gongbo. Portraits of Sun and Wang grace every home and every classroom, and membership to the Youth Corps is glorified - with posters encouraging membership as a means of serving a new China. But there is also the concern that as the country grows richer due to state-capitalist policies, there will be a growing rising economic class in the near future. While the RCA has denied that such policies will lead to outright capitalism, only time will tell whether or not a complete socialist future awaits the Republic of China."
CHI.endgame.301.a: "A toast to the Chairman and his ever loyal Premier!"

CHI.endgame.302.t: "Steward of a National Renaissance"
CHI.endgame.302.d: "According to those close to him, one of Wang's favourite past times when he is not working long hours in his office at the Presidential Palace in Nanjing is to take long walks at the National Mausoleum. He is known to frequent the Mausoleum alone or with his youngest son; perhaps he reflects on how far the revolution has come - yet there is still so much work to be done.\n\nIt wasn't easy to come to this point. The Bonapartist Deng Yanda and his clique of reactionary officers sought to disrupt the national revolution; their cries for populism would have driven China into the pitfalls of anarchy, and the upstart bourgeoise Sun Fo from Hawaii had returned just to stir up trouble within the Party. But it was neither Sun Fo's birthright nor Deng's. In the history of the Chinese National Revolution, there has been no one more loyal to the teachings and instructions of the late eternal premier Dr. Sun Yat-sen than Wang Jingwei. Was it not Wang who was present and wrote the late leader's Will? And was it not Wang, who led the Kuomintang to victory in the League War, the Expeditions of Unification, the Second Expedition, and the War of Resistance. \n\nHe could not have done it alone, however. The Chairman has always been surrounded by his closest followers, such as his beloved mentee Zeng Zhongming, his ever-faithful revolutionary comrade and wife Chen Bijun, and those such as Chu Minyi, Li Shiqun, and others within the Residence Faction. With the help of his circle, they have been able to rein in the radicalism of the RCA and also have saved the party from anti-revolutionaries.\n\nTo the Chairman, only the Party is necessary for bringing about the national revolution. And with his family in comfortable positions throughout the Party, there is little doubt that when the day comes for the Chairman to step down or (god forbid, pass away), the example of leadership set by the Chairman will carry on to his family members who will carry on the revolution. Until that day comes... China's greatest statesman shall continue to lead her to national glory."
CHI.endgame.302.a: "The Chairman's leadership shall carry on..."

CHI.endgame.303.t: "Realising Xinhai's Republican Promise"
CHI.endgame.303.d: "While some in the Kuomintang, like the Radicals of the Reorganised Comrades Association, look towards the 1924 Reorganisation on the eve of the Northern Expedition with fond nostalgia, the Chairman looks to the revolutionary sentiment on the eve of the Xinhai Revolution with greater nostalgia. In those days, comrades fought and died for a free Republican China. As China descended into warlordism and chaos, many gave up hope that democracy would be feasible.\n\nWith the Kuomintang's return to the Chinese country following the League War, the prospects of democracy have finally returned. By order of the Chairman, a grand republican National Convention is to be called and led by the Kuomintang. This convention is in the example of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who General Feng Yuxiang invited in October of 1923, to meet with regional leaders and to implement the Party's ideals on democracy and the mass movement. While the Beiyang militarists rejected Sun's plans, Wang is confident that with the Kuomintang now in full control of the Chinese country, such a convention can finally be held and that regional leaders throughout China can gather and discuss the future of democracy in the country.\n\nLed by the Moderates of the Reorganiesd Comrades Association, a provisional constitution has been drafted and will remain in place until the period of political tutelage is complete. For while the RCA-Moderates and Wang believe in the growth of democracy and the role of self-government, it is by the Party's leadership that such promises can be fulfilled. Democracy is precarious in China and unless the party-state does not nurture it, there is risk that it can dissolve into warlordism or radicalism.\n\nUntil that day comes, the Kuomintang effectively controls all elections and functions within the government. But there is certainly hope, hope that as more voices are able to clamour within the national government - that the people's four rights to democracy will finally be fully realised."
CHI.endgame.303.a: "Until that day comes..."

CHI.endgame.304.t: "A True Republican Statesman"
CHI.endgame.304.d: "In 1911, a revolutionary wave washed over the Chinese nation. The people rose up against their oppressive government, demanding democracy, the end of national humiliation, and for the government to fulfil its social obligations to them. For a bright, fleeting moment, the Xinhai revolutionaries were able to bring the old order crumbling down.\n\nThe events since then spelled doom however for this once hopeful movement. Republican groups failed time and time again across the 1910s and 1920s, often pitted against one another for influence in the south. Dr. Sun himself was unable to keep his unwieldy Constitutional Protection Movement together, with so many self-absorbed ideologues and selfish warlords willing to cut deals with the Beiyang usurpers rather than unite against oppression.\n\nChen Jiongming's betrayal in 1922 marked the turning point of the Kuomintang. It truly showed how alone the Kuomintang was - convincing Dr. Sun that only they could truly lead the way to a future uncorrupted by the stain of warlordism. Wang Jingwei was a major benefactor of the 1924 reorganisation and became a natural heir to the Eternal Premier's movement.\n\nBut Wang also went further than his revered master. He bravely went forth to extend a hand to republicans around the nation, successfully bridging what so many believed to be an impossible chasm between the Kuomintang and other Xinhai descended groups. With brilliant diplomatic skill, the grey eminence of the party healed the fissures that divided the nation to restore what was lost since 1911.\n\nThat is not to say he is some fool however, another dupe for the bandit strongmen that dominated the Warlord Era. With a proper army to keep order and the careful application of secret police work, he has kept the nation in line - lest they begin to destabilise the necessary tutelage needed to realise the Three Principles. In due time, the bourgeoisie parties that have been brought into the revolutionary fold will be taught these principles so that China may realise a truly national, democratic, and socialist future that the Wuchang martyrs died for."
CHI.endgame.304.a: "It takes time for wounds to heal."

CHI.endgame.305.t: "Musings of a Successor"
CHI.endgame.305.d: "Wang Jingwei is used to late nights in his office, diligently serving in his dual roles as Chairman and President. He is no longer the dashing, young revolutionary he once was and the scars ache as his body shows its age. Still, the piles of reports never seem to end, and Wang has no intention of retiring anytime soon.\n\nSometimes though, he pauses for a moment to muse about what will happen after he's gone. Immediately afterwards, odds are it will be Premier Zeng Zhongming that takes his place, albeit with some challengers from other Wang proteges like Chen Gongbo and Zhou Fohai. Zeng is a generation younger than him, a little bit of a playboy but shaping up now. Nevertheless the Chairman likes to think ahead, to ensure the nation is steered wisely and his legacy - and indeed the legacy of Dr. Sun before him - is secure.\n\nThere is of course, the choice of his favourite and youngest son - Wang Wenti, who was born overseas in France and only ever saw China during the Central Committee's return. While he is still quite young and has years to grow, Wang Wenti has already picked up office work for his father and is reportedly eagar to pursue a career in politics.\n\nThere is also his favourite daughter, Wang Wenxun who is currently serving as his secretary.But while Wang certainly has high aspirations for his daughter, the lingering effects of sexism may be a hindrance and burden to the young Wenxun.\n\nFinally there is also Ho Mang Hang, Wang's son-in-law, whom Wang has known since Ho was a child. A graduate of Jinling University with a degree in agriculture economics, Wang also sees in Ho as pupil that could potentially take his place as the Chairman of the Party.\n\nWang has not yet shared these thoughts with anyone, not even with his wife or Premier Zeng. Succession in the party is always difficult, as he can personally attest. Eventually, these matters will have to be resolved, but for now, all he can do is simply hope his successors will live in a better China than he did."

##Section 4c (400-599): Song Endgame Events

#Song Introduction Event Chain (400-419)
CHI.endgame.401.t: "A Shot Across the Bow"
CHI.endgame.401.d: "After about a week of intense negotiations, optimism for an quick and easy settlement between the rapidly diverging factions has evaporated. The coalition that had ousted Wang has proven too large and too unwieldy, and now that the Provisional Action Committee (now known as the Revolutionary Committee) has achieved dominance fears have multiplied that they will soon use their influence within the National Revolutionary Army as a cudgel against their political foes.\n\nSun Fo did not wait. This morning he \"fired the first shot\", presenting a proposal called \"An Outline of the Principles for Controlling Politics during the Period of Political Tutelage and the Methods of Handling Chinese Foreign Policy\". In it, he expressed optimism for the end of the military phase of the revolution but also condemned what he argued was the growing influence of the military in party affairs. Among many other articles, it also states that no active military officer may sit on the Central Executive Committee, nor can they serve as President of the Republic or Premier of any of the five yuans. Though most in the PAC would otherwise be amenable to such a proposal, the target was obvious: their champion General Deng Yanda.\n\nSun did not bother to wait for a response before going to the public with his demands: 1.) the end of Political Tutelage 2.) the reallocation of (primarily military) funding to national reconstruction 3.) the immediate drafting of a constitution. The last demand holds major symbolic importance - the Reconstruction Faction had insisted that a Constitution could not be implemented until after the completion of tutelage and would require the participation of other parties.\n\nSuch a demand effectively implies they are seeking the end of the party-state far earlier than previously forecasted. If granted, drafting would likely go through the Legislative Yuan, long a dumping ground for party exiles that seek sinecures and dominated by the RF. Intellectuals around the country have responded positively about Sun's demands, feeling emboldened to publicly condemn the party's dictatorship."
CHI.endgame.401.a: "Well now that's not really fair..."

CHI.endgame.402.t: "The Party and its People"
CHI.endgame.402.d: "Ever since the end of the Third Congress, the nation has been largely in a quiet shock - with most terrified to speak out. Despite the chaos embroiling the nation over the last few weeks, the general public was kept out of the loop about the specifics of the intra-party dysfunction, left to fend for themselves when it came to choosing the \"right\" side. Many who failed to do so have hidden in their homes awaiting for a resolution as soldiers patrol the streets, themselves wondering what would happen next.\n\nIt seems that Sun Fo was not the only one having doubts about the new government, and multiple groups had agreed to coordinate opposition, but he made the first move either out of a desire to secure leadership or perhaps because of courage afforded by his \"untouchable\" status. In any case, the World Society moved next. Cai Yuanpei orchestrated the ouster of Song Qingling as President of the China League of Civil Rights, and the League has called for students to promote discourse against authoritarian rule. Not wanting to be outdone, the CSP-Orthodox have pressed their own demands, organising a strike by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.\n\nProtests have poured out into the streets, shaking the country once more as the young Republic struggles to find its footing. While Sun Fo may have won over the nation's brightest minds, it seems that others have moved for the peoples' hearts."
CHI.endgame.402.a: "We can still talk about this..."

CHI.endgame.403.t: "Hardliners and Compromisers"
CHI.endgame.403.d: "Not wanting a repeat of earlier violence, President Song has placed pressure on negotiators to come up up with a favourable resolution to the crisis. She has also ordered the military to show restraint, though the army has yet to be ordered to return to their barracks. The old Provisional Action Committee still dominates the centre of Kuomintang political discourse, preventing any easy unification between Sun Fo's rightists and the various leftist opposition groups arrayed against her.\n\nStill, matters remain unsettled within the Kuomintang. The RCA has officially been disbanded, though unofficially a rump caucus remains. Left only with Gu Mengyu and his moderates, they have been on the backfoot, their future uncertain now that many of their old peers have been arrested or exiled. Seeking the vulnerability of Song's Revolutionary Committee, they have pressed for greater amnesty for the defeated and compromises with the public. They have been joined by many former PAC members who have called on Song and Deng to take decisive action to alleviate tensions and promote dialogue.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many hardliners who point out that continuing to recklessly compromise with everyone will simply render the party unable to statisfy anyone. They have taken the form of extremists within the party, mostly CRS-aligned officers but plenty of WMARCA members have expressed these sentiments in private. This is not to say of course that many soldiers want further fighting - many officers have gone on record opposing a crackdown and many of the enlisted wish to go home soon."
CHI.endgame.403.a: "A house divided cannot stand..."

CHI.endgame.404.t: "The Liberal Ironneck"
CHI.endgame.404.d: "There are few politicians as recognisable as Sun Fo, a fact that he has exploited to his fullest advantage. At no other point in his career has he had this much influence as he basks in the glory he has received casting himself as the defender of liberal democracy admist a socialist storm. His pretentions have made him difficult to negotiate in good faith with; many snidely remark that he seems to love the attention a little too much.\n\nHis latest lecture, delivered to cadets of the Central Training Corps is called \"Political Democracy and Economic Planning\". In it, he has decried how the Kuomintang has become too much of a separate caste, filled with haughty superiority and distant from the people. Any irony of such a speech being given by a man sitting atop an ivory tower his father built seems to have been lost on him.\n\nWhen finally sat down for another round of negotiations, he has thankfully offered some more concrete demands. For one, he insists on a \"one man, one post\" rule, ending the tendency for individuals in government and bureaucracy to hold multiple jobs at once. Furthermore, he has sought the confirmation of his close friend Liang Hancao as Premier of the Legislative Yuan, with himself as Premier of the Executive Yuan (serving concurrently as Vice Chairman of the Party) with control over several major portfolios. He has also called for major constitutional and democratic reforms, with a heavily liberal bent.\n\nNegotiators believe they can talk him down a little further from his far-reaching demands, particularly with cabinet posts and the duration of tutelage. But with the man soaking up the spotlight the way he is, it is clear that he is lining himself up to be the leading non-socialist candidate in future elections, likely dooming the revolution to a major split down the line.\n\nA more cynical option has been proposed - an envelop with certain \"useful\" information have made their way to President Song's desk. They include scandalous details about his continuing affair with socialite Lan Ni while his wife was recuperating from major illness. Combined with another affair with another woman twenty years his junior, keeping it secret from the public could be a useful bargaining chip in \"aggressive negotiations\"."
CHI.endgame.404.a: "A tough, but fair bargain."
CHI.endgame.404.b: "Let's see how tough he truly is."

CHI.endgame.405.t: "Divide et Impera"
CHI.endgame.405.d: "The fundamental concept of political tutelage came about thanks to the recognition of the lack of genuine political consciousness among China's masses. The lower classes, while long suffering under the yoke of various oppressors, struggle to meaningfully identify the root causes of their torment - often merely lashing out at their direct masters without seeing the underlying causes of their servitude.\n\nIt is the Kuomintang's revolutionary duty to not merely protect the masses but also lead and educate them. The people need to be shielded from malcontents that can steer them astray, back to bourgeoisie oppression or to destructive radicalism. Various groups have sought to weaponise the population over the years, yet few have delivered anything but more war. Many simply yearn for stability and prosperity.\n\nThe Provisional Action Committee has always been sympathetic to the people's plight, including democracy. But such widescale adoption is simply not feasible for the near future, and the other two principles of the people's welfare and national interests must also be pursued concurrently. As the Gendarmerie is reinforced by various PAC aligned militias, many wonder how far they are willing to go to enforce it.\n\nThe outburst in popular enthusiasm stoked by the League of Chinese Syndicalists, while superficially a sign of strength, in many ways is a last gasp for a dying organisation. The League has continued to splint, with students, intellectuals, and bureaucrats forming the core of the World Society (and their China League of Civil Rights proxies), while workers, labourers, and soldiers are the popular base of the Chinese Syndicalist Party and their All-China Federation of Trade Unions.\n\nThe longer things go on, the more likely the protests will simply fizzle out. The World Society is likely to fold into the PAC cause anyway given many shared values, and the CSP are quick to clash with them. But for a shining moment of genuine enthusiasm, together they seem to have captured a certain desire among the people for syndicalist-aligned change. That is something President Song and her right-hand man Deng Yanda have considered when drafting their policies. As they prepare the nation for tutelage, they go forth..."

CHI.endgame.406.t: "Building a Revolutionary Committee"
CHI.endgame.406.d: "Deng Yanda is in many ways the lead architect of the new \"Guanxi\" system, one built on personal revolutionary connections and shared ideals cultivated over years of mutual camaraderie. But these often goes both ways, and the General is just as much beholdened to his extensive civilian and military network as they are to him.\n\nThe differences between the RCA and PAC have always been muddled by the heavily intertwined networks. Sitting in the middle are a bloc often called the \"RCA-Moderates\" for their centrist positions, sometimes even rejecting class warfare. In many ways, they are even further right than both the PAC and RCA establishments, connected to the RCA mostly by such a personal connection to Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo.\n\nWith the two now out of the way, most are willing to be absorbed into the new \"Revolutionary Committee\", even if they have lingering concerns. Deng Yanda has been careful to seek out their opinions, sitting down with many such moderates to mend bridges. Although a military man by training, he has proven an adept peace-time statesman, reassuring frightened Kuomintang figures despite the fact that they have little choice but to hop aboard anyway.\n\nOn the other hand, the dividing line between moderate and radical in the party is never really clear, and there are plenty of those who continue to plot against President Song. One of the more common requests the General hears is for amnesty for various known subversives and hardline Wang loyalists. Evidently, their friends and family continue to plea their case even after their imprisonment/exile."

CHI.endgame.407.t: "Braving the Darkness"
CHI.endgame.407.d: "The China Revival Society was founded by some of the most die-hard nationalist officers training abroad in the post-1927 environment. Radicalised to the point of derangement by their bitterness, and infused with totalist ideology from their disillusioned Western peers, many had risen to posts of prominence due to a mixture of their sheer audacity in combat and shady deals made by the PAC.\n\nNow however, with the violent portion of the revolution largely drawing to a close, they have been increasingly robbed of a sense of purpose. The Kuomintang are radical in many ways, and promise a wide-reaching revolution, but even these promises can hardly satiate their craving for total change.\n\nThey have taken ill to serving in a peace-time army, forced into a life of paper-work and menial guard duty over the derring-do they had been promised. Not that they have been particularly liked by the WMARCA military establishment, who disdain their \"Young Guard\" arrogance and find that their tendency towards terror tactics make them merely feared rather than generating much genuine affection. But with the WMARCA having consolidated control over the army, there is little chance for them to change tracks now.\n\nIf things stay their course, many expect that they will slowly, but painfully fade away into history. For now however, they have proven to be a thorn in the government's side as their influence continues to linger past their welcome. Their more heinous \"revolutionary\" crimes have thankfully gone down, but been replaced by petty ones often related to racketeering or common thuggery as young officers who missed the heroic parts of the revolution seek to \"prove themselves\". If their influence has waned sufficiently, perhaps we could find an opportunity to eliminate them."

CHI.endgame.408.d: "It's the end of the line for Dai Chunfeng, the infamous \"Laboan\" (lit. the \"boss\"). After being called for a meeting, a sack was placed over his head and he was arrested, sent to an unknown destination where he has not been heard of since. In the meanwhile, Dai's men have broken into squabbling factions, further diluting their importance.\n\nDespite Dai's hated for the factionalism within the party, his agents have themselves often broken into provincial networks. He has not been above playing them against one another other, even has he stresses the need for \"jiafeng\" (family tradition). This often takes a literal dimension with his recruitment of his children, family, classmates, and fellow Zhejiangese into his agency's ranks. In particular, he has expressed a fondness for \"tough fellows of rivers and lakes\", drawn from the southern provinces (particularly Zhejiang, Hunan, and Guangdong).\n\nThese formed the basis of the now competing intelligence cliques. Mao Renfeng, Dai's childhood friend from Zhejiang has taken charge of the \"Zhejiang\" clique (and also the smaller, more intimate Jiangshan faction of men drawn from their home county). The Guangdong clique is the largest thanks to the party's historic connection to Guangdong. Led by Zheng Jiemin, they include many French trained agents. Tang Zong leads the smaller Hunan faction and include many British-trained agents. A neutral faction led by Wei Daming (the \"soul\" of Dai's operation, charged with communications) has also emerged.\n\nZheng has taken the initial advantage, but virtually nobody addresses him as \"Laoban\", a testament to the inadequacies of each of the successors without Dai. As Dai's lieutnants scheme against one another, the WMARCA has slowly taken away their prerogatives. They have placed the nominally military intelligence agency more firmly under army control, thus ending the shadow once and for all."

#Song Focus Tree Events (440-459)
CHI.endgame.440.t: "The Land to Tiller Programme"
CHI.endgame.440.d: "Feudalism has long been defined by political intellectuals and leaders within the Provisional Action Committee as the system in which the subsistence economy of China plays a dominant role in Chinese society. This system is one of inherent injustice as the landlords use political force to occupy the land and to exploit the peasants by plundering their products and forcing them to do free labour; in which the occupation of the land by landlords led to the total monopoly of political, military, and economic power. It is true that the coastal cities have already entered the capitalist stage but nonetheless, the backward northwestern, southwestern, and rural areas of China still belong to the feudal stage - feudalism is still the dominant force in China. Some of the PAC's own leaders themselves have originated from common backgrounds, such as General Deng Yanda. Since 70% of China's population are still bound to a feudal society, it is the role of the Party to step in and to liberate them from their archaic oppression.\n\nMost leaders in the PAC favour Dr. Sun Yat-sen's orthodox approach to \"Land to the Tiller\", which allows peasants to obtain their own land to till and that the government will take steps to eventually nationalise land gradually. The lands of warlords, local tyrants, corrupt officials, and evil gentry are to be confiscated and that land is not to be sold or bought in private. Those who work on the land rented from landlords should be allowed to have their rights over the land. To do this - will thus resolve the issue of land ownership without resigning the revolutionary process to excess populism.\n\nHowever, there are definitely those who question the idea of what constitutes the \"evil gentry.\" Among the military men and intellectuals within the PAC, there are those who come from landlord families who would find opposition to more radical land reforms - but there are certainly those within the PAC who believe that a much more radical land reform with aspects of a more violent social revolution is needed to fully end Feudalism's existence in China."

CHI.endgame.441.t: "The United Front Work Department"
CHI.endgame.441.d: "In the final deal between Song Qingling and Sun Fo, Liang Hancao was forced to yield the Premiership of the Legislative Yuan to the PAC stalwart Zhang Bojun. Instead, he has been made chairman of the United Front Work Department of the Central Executive Committee, a less prestigious position to be sure but integral to carrying out the party's ostensibly democratic promises.\n\nNon-Kuomintang republicans that were unable to join the LCS were often forced to participate as Dangwai (lit. \"outside of party\"). These independents were prevented from organising on any higher level, clipping their wings before they could meaningfully challenge the status quo. Their ranks have been allowed to increase as part of the agreement, allower greater representation from allied republicans.\n\nMore riveting is the inclusion of so-called \"Democratic Parties\" into the Legislative Yuan, with a preset number of seats allocated to them for the duration of the political tutelage. Required to acknowledge the dominace of the Kuomintang and swear by their Three Principles, they are expected to play a primarily advisory role. The bulk of them are small, intellectual and officially socialist groups, though a few of the more conventional, moderate parties have been included as well.\n\nZhang Junmai has cobbled together a \"Chinese Democratic League\", a collection of smaller social democratic, liberal, and other centre-left parties. With political momentum in the country shifting left-wards, the CDL has found themselves on the right-wing of the spectrum, forced to band together for relevance.\n\nThe Rural Reconstruction Association is a long-time Beiyang faction, previously operating under the auspices of the New Chinese Empire Reform Association. Not a formal party, their advocacy for rural reform and literacy programmes have made them politically palatable to the Revolutionary Committee.\n\nChina is a long way from democracy, even if on paper about a third of the Legislative Yuan are held by these \"Democratic Parties\". How much Liang Hancao will be allowed to (or is even willing to) accommodate these factions remains to be seen."

CHI.endgame.442.d: "Since the Kuomintang's return to Chinese politics following the League War, three successive repatriated National Congresses have been held to coordinate the activities and direction of the National Revolution. However, following the Third National Congress and the consolidation of the Revolutionary Committee's hold on the Party, party leaders such as Deng Yanda are calling for a new form of Congress.\n\nFollowing the \"First United Front\" Policy from the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Deng has called for the continuation of the united front with the Chinese syndicalists and socialists to facilitate revolutionary change suitable for China - under the current political climate. In the context of these policies, PAC leaders have called for a People's Congress, a congress assembled of fellow socialists, including council communists, anarchists, anarcho-syndicalists, syndicalists, and other fringe socialist groups separate from the Kuomintang. Nonetheless, the PAC has firmly rejected the syndicalist leadership of the Party, and the People's Congress is still to be organised and led by the Kuomintang as the primary organ of the national revolution. \n\nThe Congress' first agenda was to follow a new reorganisation of the Kuomintang, a reorganisation of the Party into a party purely of workers and peasants (the workers and peasants shall make up 60% of the national bodies, while other occupational groups will form the remainder). Workers, peasants, women, and soldiers (representing the broad social groups of the national and social revolution), shall elect representatives to a hierarchy of assemblies and councils in order to exercise true power. Considered a resounding success, calls for a Second Peoples' Congress have been approved, and there is no doubt a second will follow in the coming years."

CHI.endgame.443.d: "In the end, it seems that the Kuomintang has been remade in Song's image, no longer beholden to the treacherous Reconstruction Faction or the subversive Chinese Syndicalist Party or the tyrannical Wang Jingwei political machine. Instead, she has fused together the agrarian populists of the Provisional Action Committee, the anarchist idealists in the World Society, and the Moderates of the Revolutionary Comrades Association into one cohesive bloc, the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang.\n\nIn doing so, she has forged a party actually capable of delivering on its promises. One that stands for the oppressed commoners of China, giving them safety, stability, and prosperity. One that can drive out imperialists and beat back tyrants. One that can provide a genuine, socialist democracy from the humble cooperative upwards to the national government.\n\nIn this way, the RC-KMT claims to live up to the Three Principles set forth by its founder, in a dynamic and living manner of his eternal will. Some wonder however, if the RC-KMT is a little too united, held together by the strong hand of the state apparatus. As the political tutelage lumbers on, there have been some calls to loosen its grip to allow for fruitful discourse."

Known also as Sun Wen or Sun Zhongshan, the late Dr. Sun's work as a revolutionary martyr, pioneer, and philosopher inspired the Kuomintang movement. Dr. Sun truly grasped China's socio-political reality and helped revive the idea of Zhonghua by establishing a revolutionary party and army - he founded the very ideals that had helped secure the victory of the Second Northern Expedition. ]\n\nThis year, the Nationalist Government has officially granted a position of eternal honor to the late Premier of the Revolution by assigning him the name \"Guofu,\" meaning \"Father of the Nation.\" Through his endless revolutionary struggle, often marked with failure and exile, the revolution he inspired carried on - and in the end, has fully unified and freed China after decades of strife.\n\nHaving died before the Northern Expedition commenced, Sun's corpse lay in the Western Hills of [GetVictoryPointName_9843] for years. However, following the Second Northern Expedition's success, his body was properly returned to Nanjing to rest. The Nationalist government has commissioned the architect's Lu Yanzhi and Huang Tanpu to commission building a mausoleum to honor Sun forever. This majestic project combines traditional styles of imperial tombs and modern architecture, along with a tri-arched gate inscribed with Dr. Sun's quote, \"What is under Heaven belongs to all.\" A sacrificial hall is to be built with the ceiling painted with the glorious flag of the Kuomintang while Sun's body lies interned - guarded forevermore by ever-present armed guards; his memory and legacy will be treasured for generations to come."

Former PAC members and syndicalists have proposed to the Legislative Yuan of the Party to adopt a new national flag, one that brings honour to the peasants with a characterstic plow added to the Wholly Red Earth. There have been others however, who have proposed that the new Flag of the Republic should incorporate elements for both the workers and peasants. Indeed as the PAC had championed the cause for all oppressed peoples, the new flag should depict the workers and the peasants by incorporating the plow and a symbol of a cog together. Of course, there is always the option to just merely maintain the current Flag of the Republic as a demonstration of our commitment to the original ideals held by Dr. Sun's revolution."

CHI.endgame.460.d: "The legacy of the so-called \"India Clique\" is rather controversial within the reformed National Revolutionary Army dominated by the now prevelant Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association. For years, the two have been rather separate cliques within the NRA - with the India Clique being those officers that resided and trained in India, while the latter was fighting the guerrilla war in the MinGan Insurgency. There are certainly stronger socialist sympathies within the leadership of the WMARCA while the socialist tendencies of the India Clique are vague at best, and they are most adequately described as nationalists above all.\n\nNonetheless, the two factions certainly hold a shared history in the Fourth Army (Guangdong Army) of the National Revolutionary Army's first Northern Expedition. They were comrades once before, and then they were comrades once more in the Second Northern Expedition. As the WMARCA continues to consolidate its grasp and hold over Whampoa's students and loyalty - there are private reports that generals such as Xue Yue and Zhang Fakui believe that they find themselves increasing marginalised. With the military phase of the revolution concluded, there begs the question on whether or not ensuring the loyalty of the India Clique even matters - nonetheless, older members of the WMARCA have vouched for these generals due to their long standing shared comradery in the national revolution."

CHI.endgame.461.d: "Since the opening of the Whampoa Military Academy, there have often been those passionate revolutionary nationalists who are drawn to the allure of European syndicalism. The entry of the Internationale Military Mission to China helped encourage this trend towards European-inspired strains of socialism, including syndicalism and council communism. This trend led them to be viewed by suspicion by more conservative military members, especially during the Crisis of the Third Congress, as they are believed to find Marx more alluring instead of the Three Principles' of the People.\n\nThe Nationalist Government, in its bid for legitimacy and as well as to finally conclude the arduous process of national unification, as in effect - granted amnesty to all those lower-ranking officers and soldiers who had rebelled against the Central Government. Nonetheless, many of those who opposed us have become disheartened in the revolutionary cause and feel as if their career prospects have been severely harmed due to their past affiliation. Some open-minded officers in our high command have voiced that we should forgive and forget our former comrades and welcome them back with open arms into the fold.

The Political Department was a hotbed of revolutionary activity, its cadre was made up of intellectuals and officers from the League of Chinese Syndicalists and has often been associated as one of Whampoa's most socialist-leaning wings.\n\nThe victory of the Provisional Action Committee has led to a reassessment on the nature of the Political Department. General Zhang Zhizhong has taken full responsibility for the department's alignment during the unrest against the rightful Nationalist Government and has since offered his promise that the Political Department shall henceforth remain loyal to the Revolutionary Committee. General Deng Yanda has ordered a complete curriculum change for the Political Department, ordering instructors to stress the idea of \"union of all revolutionary classes\" while also reorienting the department to focus on Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People exclusively. However, some within the government have called for the complete disbandment of the Political Department, arguing that it has outlived its purpose due to the completion of the Second Northern Expedition."

CHI.endgame.501.t: "Unity of Peasants and Workers"
CHI.endgame.501.d: "On a hot summer day in July of 1924 in Guangdong, the First All Guangdong Peasant's Conference was held, in which thousands of peasants were invited to participate in the Kuomintang's mass movement. Madame Sun Yat-sen, Song Qingling, found herself moved to tears at seeing the masses march in their rags to experience in the pursuit of national salvation. Indeed the late eternal premier remarked that the revolution's success begins with the people; the revolution is part of their duty to achieve liberation.\n\nMany years later, the National Revolution has reached its concluding stages. The Orthodox Faction of the Chinese Syndicalist Party dominated the policy of the United Front with the League of Chinese Syndicalists. This alliance, the cooperation with the European syndicalists, has led to the victory of the Chinese Revolution - none can stop the advance of the workers and peasants. Despite this, the country is still effectively under the control of the Kuomintang - the KMT organises unions and associations, and the KMT is the elder sister in the relationship between the two parties. It remains to be seen whether or not this relationship will continue as it is now, whether or not the Chinese Syndicalists will gradually find themselves absorbed into the larger KMT, or if the KMT shall continue to see more of its principles diluted by the allure of syndicalism.\n\nNonetheless, there is much to rejoice in the coming years. Long have the workers and peasants toiled and suffered by the establishment of capitalism, the imperialistic institution that has divided the country and brought it to ruin. With the Revolutionary Committee in charge, a committee made up of representatives of workers and peasants - never again shall capitalism emerge in China. Together hand in hand, a new socialist dawn rises in the East - with the Chinese proletariat leading it as its proud vanguard!"

CHI.endgame.502.d: "It is truly believed by those in the World Society and Utopians in the PAC, that the Three Principles of the People shall lead to a state of tranquility and peace - a means to reach anarchism. History has shown this of course. As written by the esteemed Li Shizeng, there are revolutions that propel the course of human history: the monarchial revolution of the Shang and Zhou Dynasties that established the notion of order, the national revolutions of democracy as shown by the American and French Revolutions, and the socialist revolutions of which evidence of its success can be seen in the Commune of France and the Union of Britian. The KMT has successfully moved China through the stages of the national and socialist revolutions and now the country is ready for the fourth revolution - that is the revolution to pursue datong.\n\nThe utopians of the KMT believe that there is indeed a world free of strife and pain. Hate and anger divide unity and it is only by the power and guidance of the Party, that we may see a society free of such divisions - a society of pure love. The Revolutionary Committee of the KMT has taken steps to embrace this libertarian dream, power is to be decentralised to local authorities, workesr and peasants are encouraged to organise themselves into democratic units or regional councils, and there is to be an emphasis on decentralising central power. These ideals are believed to encompass the values and dreams of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who pursued the idea that the people of China could be taught and learned their basic rights and for democracy to flourish eventually.\n\nThe anarchists however would tell you that there is no telling when that day comes. Some remark optimistically that it may take over 3,000 years to reach this state of anarchy - that each progressive stage of human history may take decades and even centuries to achieve its results. The idea of such an anarchist federation within the KMT is flexible and acknowledges that such a revolution takes time and patience, that the Party will guide the peoples to total liberation. Until then... we shall dream on, dream of the world to come and for the futures ahead of us!"

CHI.endgame.503.d: "In 1911, the decadent Qing dynasty was overthrown in an outburst of revolutionary enthusiasm, brought down by their corruption and indifference to the people's plight. Their mismanagement, tyranny, and inability to protect the nation from marauding colonisers lost them their mandate to rule, and brought their centuries-old monarchy crashing down in less than a year.\n\nA hopeful republic followed, but it was soon betrayed by Yuan Shikai and then the warlords who treated the Beiyang government as their own personal playground, defiling it with their vices and their deceit. The party came and tried to throw off these opportunists, only to be stabbed in the back by concessionist traitors and German imperialists.\n\nLast came Wang and his RCA, who claimed to be fighting for the people but instead allowed the plague of corruption to continue, smearing themselves with the same shameful, double-dealing grime that has defined modern Chinese politics. Thanks to the brave comrades of the PAC, Song Qingling and Deng Yanda have successfuly driven out the last of unscrupulous from the halls of power.\n\nInstead, they have opened up a new era of idealism, cleaning up the corruption that once permeated the capital and bringing the Republic closer to the people. The tutelage remains necessary to educate the poor folk and bring them to pariety with the educated classes, but it is not the end of China's story. Together, the Kuomintang will create a Chinese socialism for the people, truly realising the Three Principles once and for all!"

CHI.endgame.504.t: "The Dream of Our Forefathers"
CHI.endgame.504.d: "The Kuomintang was not always a cynical vanguardist party, advocating for an authoritarian party-state. It once was a hopeful group, seeking a revolutionary but sunny, democratic future for their homeland, before everything went so wrong. Before Sun Yat-sen was betrayed by Yuan Shikai, and then the warlords, and then the red imperialists of the Internationale. Wang Jingwei and the syndicalists perverted his vision, or so the new party-line says.\n\nSong Qingling and Sun Fo, two of the people closest to him, claim to have brought the party back to what it should have been, a left-leaning democratic party working for the good the nation. The latter, in particular, seems to be quixotically trying to turn back the clock to before 1924, before the reorganisation and the party's leftwards turn. In many ways he has sought to rewrite history, ignoring many of the developments that have occurred in the ensuing decades.\n\nThere are many lingering differences between the pair, hardly two years apart from one another in age. Song believes she has set the nation on a fundamentally socialist trajectory, bringing the nation closer to a socialist, democratic ideal built around local peasant communes. The self-serving bourgeoisie parties Sun has invited in are simply a necessary evil, that with any luck will be molded to actually serve the people.\n\nTo Sun Fo, the revolution his father wanted can still be salvaged, if only he can get the constitution right. It has already gone through several stages of drafting, first under his personal oversight, then with a \"People's Political Council\" helping him, and now the multiparty \"Political Consultative Council\". He hopes to dampen the socialist radicalism to build a parliamentary republic - moving power away from the Executive to Legislature.\n\nHe has also made moves to strengthen the Premiership of the Executive Yuan at the expense of the Presidency, the first of what will likely be a long series of political battles between Dr. Sun's heirs. Despite this, some dare to hope that these fights will not be resolved by more violence, but will instead translate to a peaceful adaptation of a multiplural system at the end of the tutelage. And with China rapidly turning to a new page, a new generation dreams on."

##Section 4d (600-799): Hu Endgame Events
CHI.endgame.601.t: "Smouldering Embers"
CHI.endgame.601.d: "Fujian lies in ruins. Cities such as Xiamen and Longyan lie brutally destroyed and ravaged with Provisional Action Committee guerrillas having made a desperate last stand in Longyan. Much of what the MinGan Government had built lies in destruction and Blueshirt militias have gotten to work - handling the surrender of remaining insurgents. In a report sent back to the high command under now Generalissimo Hu Zongnan, General Deng Wenyi relayed to the capital that the region is effectively \"pacified.\"\n\nWith the ashes still burning hot and the embers smouldering, the China Revival Society seems poised to secure the rest of the country. Nonetheless, the traitorous Generals Deng Yanda and Zhou Enlai have yet to be found and are presumed to be alive, most likely organising further resistance towards the leadership of the CRS. There is also the issue and threat of further insurgent cells aligned to the PAC, the RCA, and even the CSP in major cities and rural areas around the country.\n\nThankfully, with the former members of the RCA and PAC so bitterly divided against one another, it seems unlikely they will band together in a meaningful capacity. If anything, the former factions have grown more divided, splintering into hardened, paranoid rebel cells under local personalities. Despite this, unrest continues and it is clear to the Generalissimo and to the leadership of the CRS, that pacification is yet still fully to be achieved."
CHI.endgame.601.a: "We may have won the war but not the peace..."

CHI.endgame.602.t: "Gathering Storm Clouds"
CHI.endgame.602.d: "As the pacification campaigns rage on and the China Revival Society struggles to uphold what little legitimacy it has to the leadership of the Kuomintang and of the Chinese nation - greater troubles abound the Republic, as the nation's economy is utterly in ruins. Large urban centres and parts of the countryside lay in devastation due to the civil war and the country's economic growth - which was perceived to be on the rise after unification - has effectively halted.\n\nTo make matters worse it seems that foreign trade, even with the Third Internationale, has largely stopped due to the open xenophobia and nationalistic rhetoric of the CRS. The violence of the CRS, especially regarding their anti-imperialistic and anti-foreign outlook, has led many foreigners to simply leave China and any potential investments from foreign countries seem unlikely. Foreign bankers and investors have liquidated their investments nearly overnight upon the victory of the CRS. Furthermore, many wealthy Chinese expatriates in places such as Southeast Asia and Hawaii have also withdrawn their support for the Party - with many denouncing Hu Zongnan's coup of the government as unlawful and lamenting the Party's division.\n\nWith the economy returning to League War levels of devastation and stagnation, it is unlikely that China's economy will be able to recover quickly. The storm clouds have gathered over China, and the country grows restless even further; if the CRS are to indeed hold on to their claims of Chinese leadership - then they must act quickly in resolving the economic crisis."

CHI.endgame.603.t: "The Fading Light of Minquan"
CHI.endgame.603.d: "Sun Fo didn't know, nor would he have ever dreamed that the Party would become like this. Sure, his father had authoritarian tendencies, but he did not leave the sanctuary of the Hawaiian islands to partake in the idealistic Second Northern Expedition only to see it collapse to the excesses of totalitarianism and tyranny. While he is still de facto Premier of the Executive Yuan, what difference does that make now that the National Revolutionary Army controls all parliamentary and civilian affairs?\n\nOfficially, the Reconstruction Faction still controls the Legislative Yuan and other civilian organs of the government. But this does not matter much as the entire Party's direction and military operations are entirely in the hands of Hu Zongnan and his followers. Under the direction of Hu, a state of emergency is still to be maintained indefinitely. The Legislative Yuan has been indefinitely suspended - further adding to the uncertainty of the Party's future.\n\nOfficially the China Revival Society does seek to uphold Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People (one of which is Minquan, the People's Rights/Democracy). But plenty of CRS radicals such as He Zhonghan who believe that democracy simply has no place in a modern society. To them, democracy is a poison that stains the Party's lifeline and is a degenerative disease upon the Party. He Zhonghan views the Legislative Yuan as inherently bourgeoise and seeks to abolish it, and indeed much of the bureaucratic apparatus that allows the government to run.\n\nAlmost every day now, He Zhonghan and Sun Fo clash in Generalissimo Hu's office, jostling over the fate of the suspended legislature. Although it would be a powerless rubber-stampping committee even if it did reopen, it still would still slow down the worst excesses of the new regime and is therefore poses a threat to He Zhonghan's wild ambitions. But for now, the state of emergency seems to have no end in sight..."

CHI.endgame.621.t: "The Gannan New Deal"
CHI.endgame.621.d: "Gannan, in the south of Jiangxi Province, was one of the major regions of unrest during the Kuomintang Civil War due to its location being one of the core areas of the MinGan Populist Government. The province has long been rather rural and poor, with popular vices such as opium smoking and prostitution still being popular among the locals.\n\nOne particular commissar sent south to pacify the region has received a name for himself. Chiang Ching-Kuo, the son of the former headmaster of the Whampoa Military Academy, has received great acclaim in the newspapers and journals of CRS for his work in pacifying the local population. The headmaster's son had fled alongside many other Kuomintang exiles during the collapse of the Northern Expedition and found himself in the circles of Hu Zongnan and He Zhonghan in Europe. Upon his return to China, he has found himself further entrenched in the China Revival Society, in which he has received his latest post.\n\nIn Gannan, Chiang has studied government management and has created a local \"public information desk\", where locals could visit him with their problems. He has administered harsh penalties for opium smoking, gambling, and prostitution per the doctrine of morality that the CRS espouses to. Regarding the ban on prostitutes and brothels, Chiang has created a programme where former prostitutes can find employment in factories.\n\nIn addition, Chiang has also created a Chinese Children's Village for orphans created by both the civil war and War of Resistance. This village, created on the outskirts of Ganzhou, features facilities such as a nursery, kindergarten, primary school, hospital, and gymnasium - although the training of the schools and gymnasiums emphasise the martial spirit of the CRS' ideology."

CHI.endgame.622.t: "Toys in the New Republic"
CHI.endgame.622.d: "With help from the Ministry of Education, schools in the Republic of China are directed to promote a nationalised educational policy that helps foster an unrequitable love for and readiness to sacrifice even their lives for the nation. According to an anonymous writer on behalf of the CRS, \"The children that we educate are the nation's children, not children of the family or clan.\"\nnIn the classroom, children are instructed to participate in group activities, group co-operations, and group discussions to practice collective thoughts and for students to learn to identify with the nation first rather than familial loyalties.\n\nMilitary indoctrination of children is to begin as early as kindergarten. Young children are to be given guns and warships as toys, and pictures of battle scenes would be placed on the walls \"so that from childhood, children would develop an interest in military equipment and battle situations.\" From kindergarten onwards, children are to be educated in a military environment, with middle school students enrolling in the Three Principles of the People Youth League (which is the sole youth organisation), with a strong martial emphasis. Stress is placed on physical training and group competitions - in this way, the frail and bookish students of the past are to be replaced by the revolutionary vanguard of the future.\n\nFormal military education is to begin in secondary school, in which men could partake in military training while the girls would receive training as nurses. Studies in the humanities would be discouraged, while practical and scientific subjects such as physics, chemistry, and engineering are to be oriented toward their wartime applications. For example, classes in chemistry will stress the study of things such as poison gases and explosives."

CHI.endgame.623.t: "The New Life Movement"
CHI.endgame.623.d: "The China Revival Society seeks to revive culture that is true Chinese culture. The events of the Third National Congress and the Kuomintang Civil War showed the disintegration of national culture. Thus it is imperative that a Cultural Revolution be implemented to revive the national culture and to revitalise the soul of the nation. They do not wish to reject Western modernisation but rather regard the village traditions of self-satisfaction, individualism, passivity, and superstition are unsuitable for the \"scientific age\". While the four traditions of li, yi, lian, and chi were eternally valid (the four cardinal principles of Confucianism), the CRS seeks to rectify everything wrong with \"old culture.\"\n\nThis is not a spontaneous movement but perhaps something that resonates deeply with the Generalissimo Hu Zongnan. Hu, who spent many years in exile in the Union of Britain, bas frequently linked the Whampoa cadets to that of the \"roundheads\" - and compares himself with Oliver Cromwell, a strong Republican military leader to rally the masses. He sees his personal life style of abstaining from one of vices as one the masses should emulate and the CRS itself is divided on whether or not to draw inspiration from the character of the Lingxiu or to tap more into the revolutionary nature of a cultural revolution.\n\nThe New Life Movement was launched at the behest of the Generalissimo as a revolution against reactionary liberalism and reactionary culture.  Western liberal books are banned as they are seen as encouraging decadence and lust. At the encouragement of RACA commissars, CRS members host large rallies in which foreign books are burned and denounced as foreign and Western immorality. Public smoking and spitting on the streets have been banned as they are seen as culturally and morally backward, while even perming one's hair is subject to a fine - as hair should be straight. Even relatively benign acts such as jaywalking are forbidden to encourage the image that China is indeed a modern nation that uses roads.\n\nNanchang, nicknamed one of the birthplaces of the revolution due to the fighting during the League War, is to serve as a new example of this new modern and moral China. Prostitutes and beggars have been driven off the streets and drug addicts, sent to \"rehabilitation.\" New buildings are erected on the sites of ruined and dilapidated houses, streets are widened, and a number of new parks and schools have been opened to entertain and educate the people."

CHI.endgame.624.t: "After Midnight"
CHI.endgame.624.d: "Dusk falls over the old Kuomintang, as an era comes to an end. The old order with its warlords and Emperors is long gone, thrown down by a second wave of triumphant revolutionaries. But many of those same revolutionary dreamers whose voices were once so powerful are not so anymore. The leaders who were poised to rule the nation now find themselves languishing on the sideline (or worse) as a new generation of revolutionary leadership takes the helm.\n\nWang Jingwei's clique is mostly gone, with the Reorganised Comrades Association banned as subversive. His followers have scattered to the winds, with Chen Gongbo fleeing into exile. His once mighty opposition has similarly dissolved under the weight of persecution. Song Qingling has not been seen in public in many weeks, placed under house arrest weeks ago. She officially is a board member for multiple charities often in her husband's name, though in practice lives a life of quiet solitude. Deng has never been found, it's unclear if he's still alive, but hope his underground resistance would come to anything has dimmed. Any hope for a successful United Front has died with them, and the feuding cliques of the League of Chinese Syndicalists has similarly fled - blaming one another on the way out.\n\nSun Fo seems to be the only one left standing, even as most of his wealthy followers have cut their losses and either shifted loyalty to the Generalissimo or gone abroad into hiding. The Premier of the Executive Yuan, his power has become increasingly titular - shrinking in face of the advancing Revolutionary Army Comrades Association (RACA). He Zhonghan, the leader of this (even more radical) wing of the CRS, has sought to gut the bureaucracy - inspired by the Sorelians' revolutionary teachings of an accidental vanguard. In his heated meetings with General Hu, Sun fights tooth and nail, insisting his father's words remain paramount even in this new era."
CHI.endgame.624.a: "Dr. Sun's words continue to hold merit."
CHI.endgame.624.b: "Perhaps it is time we begin to look to the future."

CHI.endgame.625.t: "Rituals and Secrets in the RACA"
CHI.endgame.625.d: "While their public front is the China Revival Society, members of the much more closeted movement of He Zhonghan's  Revolutionary Army Comrades Association (RACA), a military clique popular amongst radical Whampoa students, are responsible for the training and indoctrination of the CRS. With comparisons given to them as a fraternal organisation akin to the Reorganised Comrades Association and the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association, the RACA indeed follows a much more esoteric method of organisation and secrecy.\n\nIn fact, the most spectacular of their rituals is the initiation ceremony into RACA itself. Prospective RACA members can only achieve membership through the recommendation of older members and are instructed to learn the society's secret signs and esoteric language. At the ceremony, candidates vowed to keep the secrets of the fraternity and then read oaths from a paper which is then burned and mixed into a bowl of chicken blood, tinted with wine and sugar. New pledges then became blood brothers by squeezing some of their blood into the bowl and drinking from it. These ceremonies are accompanied by secret body and hand signals as well as a secret dance, which is a means by which the rank and file and officers identify each other.\n\nCertainly, there are reservations about these superstitious and triad-esque rituals performed by the RCA. After all such measures seem childish and with the CRS having achieved leadership of the power, is there really need for such secrecy in the movement? But there is no doubt that the fraternal organisation of the RACA is indeed quite popular amongst the new and established officers of Whampoa, and if the Generalissimo is to crack down on them - may lead to unrest amongst the followers of He Zhonghan."

CHI.endgame.626.t: "Internal Factions of the CRS"
CHI.endgame.626.d: "Despite their hatred for government bureaucracy and factionalism, the China Revival Society is made up of three major \"rings\", each ring progressively smaller than the last and representing different levels of power within the political hierarchy.\n\nThe inner circle is the Lixingshe consisting of 528 members and is considered to be the new Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. The inner circle does not even identify itself as the CRS, but rather, the CRS is a public front for the operations of the Society. Their discussions and methods are almost entirely private and secretive, although they are led by the Executive Secretary, He Zhonghan. To supervise the decision-making of policies and operations, the inner circle is assisted by a secretariat (Deng Wenyi) and by four separate functional departments, namely the General Affairs (Liu Butong), Propaganda (Kang Ze), Organisation (Zheng Jiemin), and Special Services (Dai Chunfeng).\n\nThe second ring of the concentric circles is He Zhonghan's Revolutionary Army Comrades Association (RACA), based around the graduates of Whampoa Military Academy. While they are sometimes mistaken as the actual CRS, the RACA is in charge of planting new cells and is in charge of infiltrating the civilian populace, bureaucracy, and military to raise membership for the CRS.\n\nThe final and third ring is also the largest and is the face of the political aspects of the CRS - acting as the organisation's mass base. The Fuxingshe or China Revival Societyhe lowest level of the organisation; but is also organised into four departments. However, they have no outright leadership of their own, with all matters being handled by the RACA. Orgnaised in the similar committee system of the Kuomintang, debate was admitted at lower levels, but decisions were made at the top. Furthermore, the CRS even has a supervisory system and a control commission to check and control the Fuxingshe - while also keeping watch over individual member's thoughts, behaviour, and actions, to ensure that they are loyal to the national revolution. This control group numbers over one thousand people, with its top a supervisory committee with an executive secretary at its head, with the control group further splitting into branch and sub-branch levels to maintain control over the overall strength and unity of the Party."

CHI.endgame.627.t: "The Headmaster's Legacy"
CHI.endgame.627.d: "For many people both in the party and outside of it, General Chiang Kai-shek was a well-meaning failure at best and a reactionary bonapartist at worst, his legacy sundered by the failure of the Northern Expedition and the rise of his leftist political rivals. After his assassination in 1927, few had much good to say about the former Headmaster of Whampoa in public, if anything.\n\nThis all changed with the rise of the China Revival Society, who has rehabilitated their former teacher's reputation as a disgrace, elevating him to new heights in the revolutionary pantheon. Almost overnight, state media which had previously made reticent acknowledgements of Chiang's role at most have changed their tune. Chiang has been cast as a heroic figure and dashing commander who trained a generation of revolutionaries before being betrayed by a conniving Wang Jingwei and murdered by wicked reactionaries. Chiang has become a symbol for the military, the model soldier and comrade. His personal foibles have receded into the annals of history, replaced by a nigh-mythical stature.\n\nAll of this of course serves not only a personal but also a practical one. For many of the young cadets turned national leaders who never knew Sun Yat-sen personally, Chiang Kai-shek serves as a bridge between the Eternal Premier's legacy and their own - consolidating their claim to legitimacy. But there is little doubt that there is a genuine element of loyalty involved as well given the old Whampoa Headmaster's fondness for his students, one that has been since returned. Chiang's legacy has become a fixture in Hu Zongnan's own cult of personality as the regime builds new heroes and legends."

CHI.endgame.627.b: "Generalissimo Hu Zongnan truly carries his revolutionary torch!"

CHI.endgame.628.t: "Commissions in a Changing Army"
CHI.endgame.628.d: "The National Revolutionary Army has always been fraternal in mindset, with deeply entrenched bonds of personal loyalty fortified by a shared ideological zeal. These powerful networks of social ties, often transcending party factionalisation, was torn apart when the fallout of the Third Repatriated Congress pit units and officers harshly against one another. This has threatened to tear out the heart of what was once a mighty victorious army, which repelled foes larger, better equipped, and even better led by the might of its shared, stubborn revolutionary will-power.\n\nNow, with Nanjing loyalist National Revolutionary Army units and Blueshirt paramilitaries barely able to keep order, there have been a heightened interest within the new government for limited mass-amnesty programmes for select units, lest the army be at an advantage in taking on foreign opponents. Within the military doctrinal divide, the CRS was always identified as a part of the broader \"Young Guard\" umbrella, trained extensively in foreign technologies in Europe. This has made Generals He Zhonghan and Deng Wenyi more willing to forgive members of the Political Department clique, now led by Zhang Zhizhong. Although Zhou Enlai is at large, some members of Dai Chunfeng's rivals in the Red Squad have acquiesced to returning to the fold.\n\nThe \"Old Guard\" of the military however is far more relevant and continues to carry on much of the prestige of the now mythologised MinGan insurgency and shares a heavy connection with Whampoa alumni fraternities. Thanks to the lobbying of members of the India Clique and also Lin Biao, a MinGan commander turned influential CRS leader, it is believed with the right words they can sway many of Lin's old MinGan colleagues into siding with the new government.\n\nIn both cases however, there remains a question about how much \"old mindsets\" can change, and whether or not they can be truly forgiven for their lack of vision. Perhaps the truly revolutionary thing to do would be to promote a new generation of military officers more aligned with the Generalissimo's goals."

The NRA needs to, however, thoroughly examine its ranks to gage which officers could potentially be willing followers of the new regime - or which officers seek to bring its downfall. If anything some of these officers are even a liability as not all of the officers in our employment may necessarily be former Whampoa alumni.\n\nThere is also the question of the India Clique. While they participated in the Northern Expedition, they have often been known to take sides with Sun Fo and his Reconstruction Faction. Given our own opposition to their foolish talks of liberalism and democracy, we might do well to rid the Party of the India Clique once and for all."

CHI.endgame.630.d: "The Chinese nation has known much grief over the years, as the once mighty nation fell into dispair and the state was no longer able to protect its people. As war and revolution raged, tragedy and death multiplied - virtually every household has suffered loss, poverty, displacement or the conscription of a relative. But life continued to go on, even in the darkest times and places. And now that the worst of the fighting has ceased, there has been room for happier moments as the people can finally see a future free of violence over the horizon.\n\nHu Zongnan, it seems, is one of those people. After the collapse of the Northern Expedition, Hu Zongnan vowed he would not marry until after national liberation, a promise he finally kept today in a grand wedding celebration with his beautiful young fiancee. His bride, Ye Xiadi is a fellow former teacher-turned-revolutionary from Zhejiang who became an officer in the Juntong, serving as one of Dai's secretaries. The pair were introduced to each other by Dai Chunfeng and became secretly engaged, a fact hidden until very recently.\n\nPlenty of other families have celebrated unification with weddings and children of their own, even as the dead continue to be buried. For all the trauma the Chinese people have experienced, the cycle of birth, life, and death continues on. Many were disappointed in the outcome of the once beaming revolution, but a certain sense of hope persists."

CHI.endgame.631.t: "The Prince and the Pauper"
CHI.endgame.631.d: "In many ways, the new state resembles an army - built around a strict, dogmatic hierarchy of Whampoa. At the very top of the chain of command sits Hu Zongnan, and beneath him are a more personal circle within the Lixingshe dubbed the \"Thirteen Taibao\" (a nickname derived from Chinese folklore). These men are some of Hu's most loyal supporters and proteges, and far exceeding Sun Fo, the official premier, in influence. The Generalissimo's left and right hands are He Zhonghan and Dai Chunfeng, each embodying vastly different wings of Hu's supporters.\n\nHe Zhonghan is an ideologue at heart, born to a gentry family. A former Marxist, syndicalist, and propagandist, he was an associate with Dong Biwu before studying abroad in France. A more worldly officer with roots as a middle school teacher, he holds vast ideological ambitions, hoping to refine his beliefs into a comprehensive, totalitarian socialist programme for his nation to follow.\n\nDai Chunfeng was born to a poor but determined single-mother. He spent his youth getting into fights, gambling, and also briefly studying to be a teacher. A brilliant student despite a limited conventional education, his nationalism often takes inspiration from Chinese classics and the various heroes and myths that populated them. His spent life \"living off the land\" before joining the party, and he is far less ideological than those who could flee abroad to Europe in 1927. That said, what he lacks in ideological refinement he well makes up for in dogged loyalty. His preferred name, Dai Li (lit. to wear a rain hat) figuratively indicates a servant status for his master.\n\nThe two men were born almost worlds apart in the old order, but were united by the revolution, the Whampoa spirit, and service to Hu Zongnan. Another teacher by education, but of a more humble stock, he nonetheless had his start in politics as a minor newspaper editor. He often mediates the increasing clashes between the two major wings of his party, particularly over questions of idealistic revolution, cynical patronage, personal brotherhood and national interests. Hu has leveraged his older age and his closer connection to Chiang Kai-shek to become the undisputed leader of the China Revival Society, and even now as his Taibao fight there is little question who they ultimately serve."

CHI.endgame.632.t: "The Future of Land Reform"
CHI.endgame.632.d: "While the Blueshirts of the China Revival Society are nominally unified in their desire for national economic reforms under the direction of national socialism, interestingly enough the CRS finds itself rather divided on the issue of land reform.\n\nLand reform moderates (which includes most in the Lixingshe/Central Executive Committee who are not involved with the Revolutionary Army Comrades Associaton) advocate mass industrialisation as a means of modernising agriculture. They are inspired by the machine tractor systems proposed by Savinkovists in [RUS.GetNameDef] and seek to create a similar manner in China. However, they oppose total land nationalisation -as they believe that the system of privat eland holding had resulted from an evolution of history, and to overthrow such a system would exacerbate rural disorder. Instead they advocate for a reduction of taxes and rents, the total elimination of corrupt bureaucrats, and the improvement of transportation and agricultural facilities and techniques for the peasants. It therefore, seeks to follow Dr. Sun's principle of land to the tiller, requiring that farm owners should sell only land in excess of nine acres and in exchange would receive government bonds.\n\nHe Zhonghan and his Revolutionary Army Comrades Association, however advocate for a much more radical land reform. They demand the total nationalisation of land and the organisation of production by state-managed agricultural collectives. To them, simply redistributing land to the farmers, would perpetuate the cultural statins of economic individualism. By creating a system of large-scale, rationalised production on state-owned agricultural collectives, the introduction of improved farm technology would be facilitated, as would the accumulation and reinvestment of the farm surplus. The creation of these farm plots, with the help of machine tractor stations and other means of machinery, would create the industrialisation of agriculture.\n\nBy advocating this method of nationalisation and collectivisation, the RACA knowingly commits ideological heresy by challenging the teachings of the late leader, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The RACA has answered that Sun never stated whether the ultimate land system would be based upon private or national ownership - just as a means of attaining equal rights which would naturally happen due to RACA's total nationalisation of land."

For many young officers muckraking the thoroughly corrupt Chinese bureaucracy is their chance at a career-making breakthrough.\n\nPerhaps that is why they became too bold, underestimating just how entrenched post-revolutionary interests already are. In the recently seized north, General Ma Hansan has carved out his domain as the director of the north China region for Dai Chunfeng's Juntong. Using his extensive connections and his northern background (90% of the Juntong are southerners), he has been counted as the \"fifth\" of the Juntong's \"four great generals of the north\" (the others being Wang Tianmu, Liu Yizhou, Qiao Jiacai, and Chen Gongshu).\n\nNot a Whampoa graduate, he was an outsider to the intra-Juntong rivalries between Mao Renfang's Zhejiang branch, Zheng Jiemin Guangdong branch, Tang Zong's Hunan branch, and Wei Daming's clique. Consequently, he was happy to maintain his own \"neutral\" clique, boasting that Juntong agents are \"three levels above any civilian official\". His men have been extorting money from \"traitors\", collecting \"work fees\", embezzling seized property and even selling false Juntong work permits to reactionaries to help them escape justice.\n\nThis blatant corruption and other irregularies have made him an easy target for the swarming commissars unleashed by General He. Ma has been publicly arrested (probably thanks to tips from jealous rivals) in case trumpeted by He Zhonghan's allies. Emboldened by these successes, He Zhonghan has struck out against his own rival Dai Chunfeng, trying his luck arresting dozens of Shanghai gangsters and other \"patriotic\" businessmen protected by the embarrassed Juntong.\n\nThe \"Laoban\" of the new Republic's premier secret police has exploded with his legendary temper, and has demanded the prompt release of those \"unjustly imprisoned.\" He has appealed directly to Generalissimo Hu, insisting that policing belongs in his jurisdiction. The irony of course seems to have been lost on him."

CHI.endgame.634.d: "Nicknamed the "Eagle of the Red Army, " General Lin Biao has recently achieved a reputation amongst the National Revolutionary Army for his activities during the Northern Expedition, the Second Sino-Japanese War, and most recently, the Kuomintang Civil War.\n\nLin is undoubtedly an interesting individual within the NRA, having been one of Whampoa's earliest students with a background in the Chinese Syndicalist Party and since the Second Sino-Japanese War has achieved a reputation as a rather aloof, secretive, and emotionally cold. A member of He Zhonghan's Revolutionary Army Comrades Association, Lin has recently been seen always by Executive Secretary He's side. Due to his growing political career and newfound stardom as a revolutionary hero, Lin has cultivated his own little close following amongst other generals within the CRS and RACA who seek to expand China's defense capacities and to create major industrial complexes in the hinterlands."

CHI.endgame.701.t: "The Rise of the Lingxiu"
CHI.endgame.701.d: "History has always been written and directed by great men. These exemplary individuals have emerged at crucial points in human history to guide and lead the people toward achieving greatness and national salvation. Chinese history is no exception to this rule, but perhaps one of the greatest individuals to grace our history is the first Emperor of the Qin Dynasty.\n\nNaturally, it is quite questionable why a socialist regime would revere and venerate the first monarch of a dynasty that would set the pattern for Chinese rule for centuries. But to the China Revival Society, the burning of scholars and books by the first Qin emperor, while tragic, was considered necessary to lay the groundwork for the Chinese state. It was the Qin Emperor who build foundation for the Chinese state after years of sporadic infighting and instability, and it was the Generalissimo who revived the Republic after the Civil War. By any means necessary the ideals of Dr. Sun Yat-sen must be upheld and that must be the case even if this means sacrificing one's life and liberty.\n\nThere is no questioning that Hu Zongnan is the indisputable leader of China and the only one capable of leading the Chinese people to salvation. It is only through him, that our nation can experience rebirth, reinvigoration, and revitalisation. Just as revolutionaries in the Tongmenghui and the Kuomintang pledged their lives and happiness to the late leader Dr. Sun Yat-sen, so should we pledge ourselves to our leader. Thus for the first time, yes - we do call ourselves totalists in accordance with the totalist charter. Until there is a total revolution, unless there is total obedience to the leader, we cannot achieve freedom or liberty from the chains of imperialism!"
CHI.endgame.701.a: "An great man for a great age!"

CHI.endgame.702.t: "A Nation's Salvation"
CHI.endgame.702.d: "During the first class of Whampoa, there was no other candidate that stood out than the brilliant He Zhonghan. A revolutionary and proud nationalist, he had seen Germany's role in China's humiliation and vowed that never again; never again should the Chinese people suffer under the weight of imperialism.\n\nIt was He Zhonghan who was one of the first to organise the China Revival Society from a fringe movement to a disciplined and orderly organisation. Under him, the Revolutionary Army Comrades Association was created for soldiers in the Whampoa Military Academy to grow together, to work together, to fight together, and to share the burdens of the national revolution. But it was also He's own writings that European totalism imbued the spirit of Dr. Sun's Revolution and only through such totalitarian means could the country be saved.\n\nTo say that He Zhonghan advocates for an authoritarian state is an understatement as he advocates for a completely unabashedly totalitarian state. As the Executive Secretary of the Lixingshe, he has passed numerous laws that forbid any seditious activity from journalists and that all newspapers must be censored and run through the state. Only under such control, can the masses learn - can they learn that our means of revolution is correct. Furthermore, all information that goes through to the Generalissimo must pass through He first; leading to resentment amongst some members of CRS who wonder who is really in charge.\n\nOur country is one of dreamers, and He's dreams of China are slowly but quickly becoming a reality. The Executive Secretary yearns for a day when tutelage does not need to be practiced and when the people themselves can control the masses. With their new cultural patterns, taught to them by the RACA and CRS, theywould be able to control dissenting minorities and to truly practice minquan - truly work towards the social and national revolution."

##Section 4e (800-999): Chen Endgame Events
CHI.endgame.801.t: "Shattered Dreams"
CHI.endgame.801.d: "The dust settles, and the guns have fallen silent across China as the Kuomintang Civil War has finally concluded. The Provisional Action Committee is broken, many of its leaders having either fled into exile or killed in battle - with General Deng Yanda missing (rumours have it that he has fled for Europe or for the Legation Cities). Song Qingling has peacefully surrendered but she has been \"encouraged\" to take a break from national politics indefinitely.\n\nThe Chinese Nationalist Party or Kuomintang, has long been regarded as the sole revolutionary body in China, the only party capable of liberating China from imperialism and overcoming years of political instability in the form of warlordism. Truly, Dr. Sun Yat-sen is world renowned for his efforts in organising the Chinese Revolution against the Qing and is well respected for his ideals of democracy, welfare, and nationalism. Respected throughout the nation and externally for their revolutionary goals - the Kuomintang's reputation has since fallen short due to their brutal civil war. The Party's reputation lies in tatters and some observers even remark that a period of warlordism is likely to return to the country.\n\nNow Chen Gongbo, the Premier of the Republic of China, is determined to rebuild order and to revive the Party's image. But to do so, the party must be first reorganised - it must be purified even if this process takes violence, requires blood... the Party needs to be reformed. Dreams stay as dreams unless someone acts upon them. For Chen, he is fully determined to make these dreams become reality."
CHI.endgame.801.a: "China awakens to a harsh reality..."

CHI.endgame.802.t: "A Nation in Ruins"
CHI.endgame.802.d: "Following the success of the National Revolutionary Army during the League War, the League of Eight Provinces effectively served as the main powerbase and bulwark of the National Revolution for the Second Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance. The industry of Jinling as well as the natural resources of Anhui, were used to fulfill the needs of the growing National Revolutionary Government and the NRA.\n\nDuring the Civil War of the Party, much of the infrastructure and industry of China's eastern coast were damaged or utilised during the fighting. Furthermore, good portions of the country, especially the major cities, are still under martial law, and their economic productivity has been effectively slowed.\n\nMoreover, many regional actors such as local governors and administrators have grown unruly due to the weakness of the Kuomintang and the lack of effective centralised authority. Corruption is rampant, and there are claims that some villages are in starvation without food supplies. Money hoarding, banditry, and violence pervade throughout the country and government agencies/police are finding it to difficult to control the nation. Outside investors to the Republic of China have also called in their loans due to the shaky nature of Nationalist political power, and the welfare policies of the Party have effectively been placed on hold since the Civil War."
CHI.endgame.802.a: "Du passé faisons table rase."

CHI.endgame.803.t: "The Ringing Paranoia"
CHI.endgame.803.d: "Throughout the Party, there is a consistent fear that there is always an ever-present danger or the potential of a \"second wave\" of unrest, given the chaos of the Kuomintang Civil War. Party leaders and officials walk with fear even in broad daylight, fearing they may become victim to the next day's newspaper heading.\n\nAlthough Chairman Zeng Zhongming is seen as a more palatable leader than Chen Gongbo due to his connections to the Party's Residence Faction, he simply isn't enough for many in the Reorganised Comrades Association. The RCA yearns for the completion of the national and social revolution; to them, there is no one more capable of carrying out the radical revolution than Chen himself. Tensions have been growing between the Residence Faction and the Reorganised Faction as both factions are now suspecting the other for potentially seeking to remove the other from Party influence.\n\nDespite the persistence of the Young Guard Clique and the Political Department in maintaining order, Chen Gongbo's own paranoia has skyrocketed, and he sees enemies at every corner. He has taken the death of the Chairman particularly hard, and he sees the Military as the primary cause for the party's weakness. To him, the Provisional Action Committee, India Clique, the CRS, and even the Internationale Military Mission in China have been responsible to some degree of stoking the flames of unrest.\n\nHe has further taken out his anger on Zhou Enlai's Red Squad and for General Zhang Zhizhong for having not done enough to protect the beloved Chairman. As such, there are rumours and whispers in the dark that the Young Guard is seeking to have Chairman Zeng Zhongming step it up and to take a harsher and more firm stance against the Premier."
CHI.endgame.803.a: "It starts when you're always afraid..."

CHI.endgame.804.t: "The Vile Drink"
CHI.endgame.804.d: "It's no secret that the Chairman of the Kuomintang, Zeng Zhongming, does enjoy a good drink now and there. Since his youth, he has found himself enamored with a lifestyle of culture - surronding himself with affairs, nightlife, and an always present bottle of Merlot. Now however, the Chairman has grown increasingly reclusive and has avoided public appearances out of sheer depression as a result of the death of his two friends Wang Jingwei and Chen Bijun. Furthermore, he finds himself placed into a position of high stress, paranoia, and pressure as his political experience pales in compairson with some of the more vocal ideologues of the RCA.\n\nTo Zeng, Wang is more than just a friend and a comrade, he is a loving mentor - a teacher and a model to follow. Every night in the Presidential Palace, Zeng locks himself in his study and spends his long hours composing beautiful poems dedicated to his fallen friend and mourns that it should have been Zeng not Wang who had to die. Drowning himself in his sorrows, many within the Reorganised Comrades Association are aware of the Chairman's battle with the vices and some have began whispering plans to depose the Chairman in favour of a much more organised and stable leadership. It is clear that as long as the Chairman struggles with his liquor, the fate of the Party continues to hang in balance."
CHI.endgame.804.a: "Another glass won't hurt."

CHI.endgame.805.t: "Freed from the Devil's Drink"
CHI.endgame.805.d: "After a long struggle with alcohol, Chairman Zeng Zhongming has decided to fully commit himself to sobrierty. The first few weeks... no, the first few days were hell on earth. From hand shakes to headaches, the Chairman often had to excuse himself from meetings with members of the Central Committee, much to the smug satisifcation of those in the RCA such as Shi Cuntong and Chen Gongbo. Nonetheless, with his sister Zeng Xing by his side, the Chairman has forsaken drinking and has taken it upon to himself, to focus on French and Chinese literature in his freetime.\n\nNow, with significant government reforms underway and his confidence restored, the Zeng of today is not the Zeng of yesterday. There are few rumours suggesting to overthrow the young Chairman, as the Chairman now finds himself confident enough to host long meetings and make public addresses. His paranoia, while lingering, is no longer the same as it was when he inherited the position of Chairman from his late teacher."
CHI.endgame.805.a: "It gets better day by day."

CHI.endgame.841.t: "The Nanjing Trials"
CHI.endgame.841.d: "Held within the Judicial Yuan, although dominated by the presence of the Reorganised Comrades Association, the ringing gavel and cries of \"Guilty!\" rang throughout the halls of the Kuomintang's high court. One by one, high-ranking members of the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association were marched to the stand and, despite their staunch defenses, were sentenced to the firing squad. Those lucky have fled overseas or gone into hiding, and a nationwide manhunt is being held for Deng Yanda.\n\nThe Political Department of the NRA has struggled to deal with the army's size and lack of effective administration, given that much of the former leadership has effectively ben purged by the RCA. While the RCA does envision a China where the military plays as minimal of a role in national politics as possible, the lack of a capable military administration is also concerning, given that the reactionary powers may threaten China. \n\nStill, there are those lower ranking in the WMARCA who have pleaded for amnesty and have declared that they would swear loyalty to the new regime and support the Party fully with devotion. These generals are socialists and believe that the RCA's socialism is in tune with their own personal beliefs - in addition to having been rendered submissive by the destruction of PAC's leadership. There are also radical young officers like Lin Biao within the China Revival Society who find that the RCA's radicalism and direction towards authoritarianism match their own ideologies. Of course, the new military could rely on their loyalists within the Young Guard, but these generals certainly lack the experience of those in the CRS and WMARCA."

CHI.endgame.841.b: "Invite in the CRS remnants!"
CHI.endgame.841.c: "We will stick with our loyalists."

CHI.endgame.842.t: "The Battle for the Land"
CHI.endgame.842.d: "The land issue has never been neglected in the ideology and doctrine of the Kuomintang - in fact, the late Dr. Sun spoke vividly about the \"land to the tiller\" and \"equalisation of land rights\". The First National Party Congress, after all proclaimed that equalisation of land rights was one of the two main factors of Minsheng, the People's Livelihood. During the First and Second Northern Expeditions, the Party's policies towards the peasantry were conducted and in some liberated areas of the Expedition, rent-reduction campaigns were vigorously conducted.\n\nChen Gongbo and the Reorganised Comrades Association have also expressed a great interest in maintaining the mass movement through the means of radical land reform in comparison with the orthodox approach laid out by Dr. Sun. Chen Gongbo's primary approach is to methodically have the government pass land laws so that the National Government may be able to seize land lawfully. The other approach, which is supported by most radicals of the radicals in the RCA is to promote \"land confiscation\", of which landowner lands are to be confiscated by the peasants.\n\nChen Gongbo and more moderate members of the RCA favour the first approach on the account that land would not be fully distributed by the second method, and that land would now just be in the hands of a private peasantry. Still, the members of the RCA agree in unison that lands from all big landowners must be seized at once and the large landowners driven off from their lands. Party members, however, disagree on the status of the small and middle landowners, who are considered a potentially revolutionary class in the form of a petite bourgeoise; with Chen maintaining a more moderate course compared to some of his more radical colleagues."
CHI.endgame.842.a: "Pursue Chen's Course."
CHI.endgame.842.b: "Pursue Shi's ideas."

CHI.endgame.843.t: "The New Citizens Movement"
CHI.endgame.843.d: "A recent order from the Central Committee and sponsored by the Premier of the Party is the New Citizens Movement which encourages civilians to report on nefarious and subversive activities on fellow party members. Party members are encouraged to keep tabs on each other, and local officials keep lists of the number of Reorganised Comrades Association members in their towns and residences. Young children in the Youth Corps are told by their teachers and instructors to report their parents to the police and the Party - if their parents present dissenting opinions on the Party or the RCA's leaders.\n\nFurthermore, there has been an increasing attempt by the RCA to create a cult of personality centred around the Late Leader, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and recently deceased Chairman, Wang Jingwei. Portraits of Sun and Wang are found in nearly every public building, and families frequently dine beneath a portrait of Sun and Wang. Propaganda posters and radios frequently depict the glory of the Nationalist Revolution and show Chairman Zeng and Premier Chen as glorious and infallible leaders. In universities and schools, students have been agitating against their professors, with some students even reporting their teachers for \"counter-revolutionary\" thought and ousting their instructors for rightist beliefs.There isn't much opposition to the leadership of the RCA-radicals as the few military generals around, such as Zhang Zhizong and Zhou Enlai, follow the instructions of the Premier with almost zero hesitance (either out of fear or fear of political instability). At the same time, Zeng Zhongming and the remnants of the Residence Faction find themselves powerless to do much. Perhaps there are those within the government who can ask Chen to pursue a less radical direction for the revolution but at this point, is there much that one can do?"

CHI.endgame.843.b: "Will someone dare speak up?"

CHI.endgame.844.t: "The Manila Plot"
CHI.endgame.844.d: "Since the Reorganised Comrades Association secured victory in the intra-party civil war, many of the Party's more bourgeoise or wealthier elements have fled the country, having seen the writing on the wall. Many in the Reconstruction Faction's leadership have been brought to trial for their crimes against the state in participating in Sun Fo's short-lived government - with grim futures awaiting them.\n\nWith Song Qingling under house arrest and Deng Yanda missing - the remaining opposition toward the dominance of the RCA has dwindled to only a few opposition leaders. Sun Fo and loyal followers of his clique, including Wu Chaoshu (C.C. Wu), Liang Hancao, Huang Hanliang, and Wang Kunlun - have fled the country, their whereabouts unknown. At least this was the case until a Red Squad agent abroad in Southeast Asia has wired back to Nanjing that the late leader's arrogant son would soon be visiting the city of Manila in the Philippines to greet the overseas Chinese community.\n\nIt seems that Wang Kunlun has betrayed the old \"iron-necked\" liberal. While a long-time friend of Sun Fo, Wang (a staunch leftist) has been a secret member of the RCA and fearing for his family's safety - has chosen to betray Sun Fo in exchange for amnesty in the new Reorganised government. He has promised to help us provided that Sun Fo does not get hurt and is allowed to return back to China safely. It is up to Chen Gongbo, the Premier of the Republic, to decide what to do with this information. While there are urgent reports that Sun Fo is organising an overseas government in exile and seeking to retake the mainland, surely he isn't serious and won't plan to try anything. And besides, the Red Squad, ever loyal to the Party, can always be utilised to deal with these threats to the Central Committee. Of course, this is Sun Fo - the late leader's son - but Chen won't step to that level... would he?"
CHI.endgame.844.a: "The operation may proceed."
CHI.endgame.844.b: "We have shed enough blood already."

CHI.endgame.845.t: "The Reconstruction Government"
CHI.endgame.845.d: "In a busy and well-to-do neighbourhood of Manila, the Chinese Overseas Merchants Association had  organised a grand party in a Chinese dining parlor  to commemorate the arrival of Sun Fo in the Philippines. However, claiming that he was under the weather at the last minute, Sun Fo was absent from the evening festivities. Nonetheless, prominent Reconstruction Faction members such as Wu Chaoshu and Huang Hanliang were in attendance, and those in attendance raised toasts to Dr. Sun's son and to the end of the Reorganised Comrades Association.\n\nThe dinner toasts were cut short as two disguised gunmen pulled out their concealed sub-machine guns and fired into the crowd - before running out of the parlor and into the night. In the chaos of the gunfire, both Wu Chaoshu and Huang Hanliang were killed - but the assassins had not known about Sun Fo's change of plans and had thus missed their original target.\n\nIn the wake of the bloodshed, Wang Kunlun, with perhaps a change of consciousness, has revealed to Sun Fo the Red Squad's role and has apologised profusely to Sun Fo for he believed that we had attempted to organise Sun's extradition back into China rather than an attempted assassination. With Sun's fury matching his father's, Wang's fate will be left up to the mercy of Sun Fo and his few remaining supporters.\n\nSun Fo has declared a new Reconstruction Government and has angrily denounced the government in Nanjing as an illegitimate Chinese government. Finding a new second wind in his political career, he has declared a Kuomintang government-in-exile. However, he lacks support from any major nation, nor does he have an actual base to prepare his counter-revolution. While our assassins have certainly failed in their objectives, we shall pay no mind to this reactionary rightist attempting to cause unrest in our revolution."
CHI.endgame.845.a: "A disgrace to his father and to the Party."

CHI.endgame.846.t: "The Assassination of Sun Fo"
CHI.endgame.846.d: "In a busy and well-to-do neighbourhood of Manila, the Chinese Overseas Merchants Association had organised a grand party in a Chinese dining parlor to commemorate the arrival of Sun Fo in the Philippines. Many of the guests had expected the son of the Chinese Kuomintang's founder to deliver a grandiose speech, and there were even talks that Sun Fo was organising the expatriate community to resist the Reorganised Comrades Association. Those in attendance included Wu Chaoshu, Huang Hanliang, and Wang Kunlun, amongst the other leaders of the Reconstruction Faction, which had joined Sun Fo in exile. Cheers and toasts to the son of the eternal premier were raised, with many also adding in extra toasts to the end of the Chen-Zeng leadership.\n\nThe dinner toasts were cut short as two disguised gunmen pulled out their concealed submachine guns and fired into the crowd - before running out of the parlor and into the night. In the chaos of the gunfire, several luminaries of the Reconstruction Faction present were murdered including Sun Fo - who had been unable to escape the same fate as Wang Jingwei. Perhaps to tie up loose ends, Wang Kunlun was also murdered - despite the latter having agreed to betray Sun Fo for his and his family's safety.\n\nDespite this, everyone knew the true culprits behind the attack. A sense of dread has settled upon the expatriate community, especially with the murder of the son of the Kuomintang's founder. To some, Sun's attempts to build a rival government led him to receive the fate he did. Still, many are horrified with how ruthlessly the Chen-Zeng RCA leadership settled the manner, and the RCA has made it clear how they will deal with those who oppose its domination of the Kuomintang."
CHI.endgame.846.a: "A fitting end for a traitor."

CHI.endgame.847.t: "The Falling Orthodoxy"
CHI.endgame.847.d: "The once fragile League of Chinese Syndicalists now finds itself completely broken apart. The idealistic alliance of non-Kuomintang-aligned socialists has fallen into disunity due to the greater factional struggles between the Party. As a result of their support to the Provisional Action Committee, the World Society of anarchists has been effectively banned by the Party, with most of its leaders having fled for exile elsewhere. Meanwhile, for most of the Orthodox Faction of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, their leaders and followers either chose ambivalence during the civil war or supported the PAC. As a result, many of them have been sidelined by the new \"Reorganisation\" - with the Premier declaring that they were merely rightists in disguise.On the other hand, the Radicals of the CSP supported the RCA during the Kuomintang Civil War.\n\n Many in the Radical Factions hold similar radically socialist and broadly authoritarian views of socialism in comparison with the other factions of the LCS. They, too, see history from purely materialist concepts, the idea of a revolutionary cadre to lead the masses, and the ideas of class struggle. Now, with the National Congress of the Chinese Syndicalist Party approaching rapidly - CSP Old Guard leaders such as Chen Duxiu and Li Lisan are confronted with a dividing party, as it is clear the radicals are seeking to fold into the RCA.\n\nChen Gongbo's pervasive influence through the CSP is felt through the radical Shi Cuntong, who was once a member of the CSP. Nonetheless, despite the radicals' immense popularity, the Orthodox Faction may still have a chance to win this election as both Li Lisan and Chen Duxiu are seen as respectable and founding members of the Party."
CHI.endgame.847.a: "The Old Guard falls."
CHI.endgame.847.b: "By a slim majority, the Orthodox hold on...!"

CHI.endgame.848.t: "Honouring the Fallen"
CHI.endgame.848.d: "Revolutionary, patriot, hero, martyr. Wang Jingwei's death shook the very core of the Kuomintang as the Chairman of the Party was assassinated along with his wife, sparking a brutal civil war and throwing the nation into chaos. Wang's body has been recovered along with his wife and now what's left of his followers in the Residence Faction and the Reorganised Comrades Association have come together in an act of rare unity to decide where to lay the Chairman to rest.\n\nThe Chairman's final wishes were always to be buried in Guangdong, his native home province, and to be buried alongside fellow revolutionary martyrs. His wife's wishes were also to have been buried in Guangdong and as such, it would make logical sense for the two to be buried together. On the other hand, more radical members of the Party have advocated for Wang to be buried at the semi-completed National Mausoleum near the second peak of the Purple Mountain. There he can be buried alongside the legendary founder of the Party, thus connecting the teacher and the martyr together for eternity."
CHI.endgame.848.a: "Honour the late Chairman's Will."

CHI.endgame.849.t: "The Silent Partners"
CHI.endgame.849.d: "With faith in the Kuomintang at a rather all-time low, Chairman Zeng Zhongming and his wife Madame Fang Junbi have been going on an all-out charm offensive to win the hearts and minds of the people. His wife is close with the Lingnan School of Painting and is a professor by training. One of the few prominent female Chinese painters, she has brought her acclaimed solo exhibition down from Shanghai to her home province of Fujian, no doubt to woo over the former rebellious province. Her family, almost all long-time Kuomintang members, have also been doing work all across the province to push a path of reconciliation - although the family's wealth has come under attack by members of the Reorganised Comrades Association.\n\nHis older sister Zeng Xing, also a prominent Kuomintang member, has taken up a post as the head of the Ministry of Women. Never insignificant, people have nonetheless noted an increase in public appearances, filling in the vacuum in national female leadership now that Song Qingling has retired from the national stage to \"focus on charity work\".\n\nZeng has travelled around the county, giving speeches and trying to calm tensions. Although mostly a figurehead and for the most the silent partner for Wang Jingwei, he has managed to carve out a powerful niche for himself as a national symbol of stability. His Public Relations team have worked to ensure he is always photographed with respectability as he tours the regional party offices, newly built factories, military bases, and meets with civic groups. He is no Wang Jingwei, but even his worst detractors have to admit he has been effective in anchoring the new government's legitimacy."
CHI.endgame.849.a: "Zeng has big shoes to fill."

CHI.endgame.850.t: "Chen's Theory of National Capitalism"
CHI.endgame.850.d: "As the National Revolution is led by China's workers and peasants,  it is unthinkable that these two classes would aim to establish a capitalist state. Moreover, the bourgeoise in China have yet to coalesce into a distinct class and was too weak to dominate the political and economic scene. As China is so economically backward and her economy controlled by imperialist powers, the state has to play an important role to build capital and to assist industrial development. Once sufficient capital was achieved, China could develop into a modernised society and truly head towards socialism.\n\nAs an economist, Chen's writings on national capitalism are perhaps some of the most eloquent within the Kuomintang. He has recently published an article \"How to build State Capital at the present time\", clarifying that the Principle of Minsheng is by nature a state intervention policy. To build state capital, Chen agreed with Sun Yat-sen that the state should nationalise railways, big enterprises, and the mining industries, but he also expands on this by declaring that the Party should also enforce the nationalisation of foreign trade.\n\nPrivate capital should not be excluded in the economic development of China, rather he has stressed the complementary role of private capital to help build a future China. Through the establishment of joint government-merchant enterprises, chartered companies could control foreign trade profits while helping peasant-worker cooperatives increase production.\n\nOf course, to many, Chen's theory raises the idea of whether or not this would simply lead China to capitalism. But Chen has refuted these ideas, declaring that the presence of the Party and state control of the economy would prevent unrestrained economic growth. Chen also stressed the participation of the working class and peasantry into developing China's new economy. When state industry had reached a certain size, the majority of the working class can be integrated and save them from being exploited by capital - with the same concept applying to the peasants. Over time, the class distinctions between peasants, workers, and allied petite bourgeoisie would diminish as they would both be merely \"producers of society,\" therefore with national capitalism comes the inevitable tide of socialism."

CHI.endgame.851.t: "Reactionaries in the Army"
CHI.endgame.851.d: "The National Revolutionary Army was once designed to be a future elite vanguard of the National Revolution, the future bulwark and defense of the motherland. However, practical concerns have overridden the initial elitism of the army. Over the years of the Unification Campaigns, the NRA has greatly expanded to amass plenty of officers from the warlord armies to accommodate the growing military forces. Furthermore, in local administrations of provincial regions - local mercenaries and former warlord administrators have often been reinstated due to the speed and advance of the NRA.\n\nThere have also been Kuomintang sympathisers in regions outside the territory of the National Revolutionary Government, such as General Chen Mingshu and General Zhu De who have... questionable loyalties, to say the least. Many of these officers hold rather high positions and are seen by the Premier of the Republic to be either rightists or anti-revolutionaries.\n\nThe Premier and the Young Guard of the NRA seek to purge these reactionary elements and to foster a new revolutionary spirit in the halls of Whampoa. Still, this move is unpopular among some in the NRA - who are worried that further purges would merely destabilise and demoralise the already weary NRA. Surely, after all - these officers offer more in practical military knowledge rather than political matters. However, the Chairman only sees enemies behind every corner, and the army must be fully converted to the ideas of the revolution if the revolution is to be kept safe from collapsing into degenercy."

CHI.endgame.901.t: "The Legacy of Wang Jingwei"
CHI.endgame.901.d: "Despite their differences, Zeng Zhongming (a former French teacher and artist) and Chen (an avid nationalist and leader of the Radicals of the Reorganised Comrades Association) - the Chairman and his ambitious Premier - have formed a unique working relationship. Certainly, Chen is the main muscle behind the government, and he has been compared to other great Premier/Chancellor-like figures in the West, such as Cardinal Richleau and Otto von Bismarck (while political opponents of the Chen-Zeng regime denounce Chen as merely Cao Cao with red paint).\n\nNonetheless, Zeng has proven himself to be more than just a puppet figurehead and has gained confidence in party politics. While initially reluctant and depressed to carry on the leadership left behind by his dear revolutionary comrade Wang Jingwei, Zeng's energy in reaching out to the peoples of the country as well as his own charisma - allows him to play a mediating role between what's left of the Residence Faction and the RCA. He is able to prevent the excesses of radicalism from spilling over into society, and as Chairman, he does have the power to hold back the worst of Chen Gongbo's more radical reforms.\n\nWith a supposedly collective leadership (albeit dominated by the RCA), Chairman Zeng is leading China to accomplish the final will left behind by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and to honor the sacrifices of the great Chairman Wang. Wang's portrait can be spotted in nearly all government buildings and his likeliness deified - as he is depicted as the most exemplary revolutionary there can possibly be behind Sun Yat-sen. As he goes on his long walks to reduce the stress of his position as Chairman, Chairman Zeng thinks that if Wang were still alive, he would be proud of his fellow brother in the national revolution.\n\nBut for now, there is work to be done. The revolution is still not complete, and Chen and Zeng are determined to finish it. Until then, one can only see whether the KMT will eventually lead the workers and peasants to full democracy."
CHI.endgame.901.a: "The diarchy reigns supreme."

CHI.endgame.902.t: "A New Chairman"
CHI.endgame.902.d: "Order has finally been restored to the country. Despite the role of reactionaries and anti-revolutionaries, the Kuomintang has held on to its leadership of the nation, and the Party is able to enforce its socialist and authoritarian tutelage to prepare the Chinese nation for the growth and development of socialism.\n\nIn a move that startled the nation however, Chairman Zeng Zhongming announced that he would be stepping down from his dual positions of Chairman of the Kuomintang and President of the Republic, ending his brief tenure stabilising the nation. In his resignation letter, he cited his struggling mental health as well as a desire to \"spend more time with his family\" as the reason why. The exhausted Chairman emeritus was thanked and wished well by Premier Chen Gongbo and other party elites in a pleasant parting celebration hosted on his last day in his position.\n\nIt was followed by a quick Central Committee vote, Chen Gongbo was elected as the next Chairman of the Kuomintang joined by Shi Cuntong as Premier. At Nanjing's Presidential Palace, Chen Gongbo gave a fiery speech to a mass rally of thousands of members of the Reorganised Comrades Association and the Youth Corps, his eyes burning with ambition and passion. With eloquent hand gestures akin to the former Chairman Wang Jingwei, Chen angrily denounced the capitalist nations of the West and promised that capitalism was to be destroyed by the revolutionary fervor of the Chinese people. As he concluded his speech, the Chairman declared the continuation of the national revolution until all rightists were removed from the country and urged the youth of China to seek modernism, progress, and adopt a cultural revolution against traditional bourgeoise degeneracy.\n\nAs China blazes forward with its all-encompassing revolution, Chen has recently commissioned a statue of Wang Jingwei to stand alongside a statue of Sun Yat-sen in Nanjing. The Chairman has not forgotten Wang's leadership over the years and hopes that Wang would be proud of him for reviving the Kuomintang, reorganising the Party, and finally fulfilling the National Revolution. Destiny, however favours those who are ambitious and with great patience; Chen has achieved his dreams... and only the future knows where his dreams will take the nation next."
CHI.endgame.902.a: "If only Wang could see me now..."

chi_dom.1.t:0 "Return of the Central Committee"
chi_dom.1.d1:0 "After a long and tension-filled voyage from Paris, the KMT's Central Committee has arrived at the newly-captured port of Wenzhou. Because of the ongoing state of chaos in southern China, this was a quiet affair with little in the form of pomp. Wang Jingwei later delivered a brief statement outside the customs office to reassure local citizens that peace in Wenzhou would be ensured.\n\nAlong with the Nationalist Government-In-Exile, a French-trained and equipped regiment of Chinese expatriates has arrived to assist in securing southern China, along with stocks of Weltkrieg-era rifles and ammunition."

Wang Jingwei later delivered a brief statement outside the customs office to reassure local citizens that peace in Xiamen would be ensured.\n\nAlong with the Nationalist Government-In-Exile, a French-trained and equipped regiment of Chinese expatriates has arrived to assist in securing southern China, along with stocks of Weltkrieg-era rifles and ammunition."
chi_dom.1.d3:0 "After a long and tension-filled voyage from Paris, the KMT's Central Committee arrived in small groups through the legation port of Fujian and has traveled secretly to Longyan. Because of the ongoing state of chaos in southern China, this was a quiet affair with little in the form of pomp. With Song Qingling present, Wang Jingwei later delivered a speech outside Longyan's City Hall, congratulating the JiangFu soldiers in holding out thus far.\n\nAlong with the Nationalist Government-In-Exile, a French-trained and equipped regiment of Chinese expatriates returned via Fujian's ports in small squads. A large cache of smuggled rifles and ammunition provided by the Commune is currently being distributed via backchannels."
chi_dom.1.a:0 "Welcome back, Chairman Wang."

chi_dom.2.t:0 "The Harvest of 1936"
chi_dom.2.d:0 "Before the National Revolution began, the soldiers living in the Jiangxi-Fujian Insurgent Zone would assist local peasants in the autumn rice harvests. With the NRA back to fighting a conventional struggle, there are less hands than usual to help the heart of the revolution with agriculture."
chi_dom.2.a:0 "They'll have to get used to these changes for the greater good."
chi_dom.2.b:0 "Divert new recruits to get some moral training in the fields."

chi_dom.3.t:0 "Leader of The Sanqingtuan"
chi_dom.3.d:0 "Recently, Dai Chunfeng has suggested calling for more youths to participate in the revolution of Three People's Principles. The proposal of establishing the Sanqingtuan is regarded by most people as a sign of ZhongTeJu’s expansion. However, much to their surprise, it seems that Dai Chunfeng is unlikely to directly appoint a leader of the Sanqingtuan, which offers us an opportunity. Zhou Enlai proposes that the splendid Youth general\nXiao Ke is best qualified for this position due to his superior leadership skills, while Song Qingling suggests our “Big Sister” Cai Chang is the better choice, as her image as the “Tigress soldier” will make for excellent propaganda."
chi_dom.3.a:0 "Choose Cai Chang"
chi_dom.3.b:0 "Choose Xiao Ke"

chi_dom.4.t:0 "Liao Zhongkai Dies"
chi_dom.4.d1:0 "Earlier this morning, in the company of his family, the KMT veteran and a revolutionary hero Liao Zhongkai passed away in his sleep. Many of the leading figures in the KMT attended his funeral, including the current KMT leader Wang Jingwei. While the KMT members are mourning his death, Chen Gongbo, one of Wang Jingwei’s assistants and political allies, inherits Liao's place, and announces that he will carry on Liao’s legacy and continue the struggle of his revolutionary career." chi_dom.4.d2:0 "Today morning, under the company of his family, the KMT veteran and a revolutionary hero, Liao Zhongkai has passed away in sleeping. Lots of the important people of KMT attend his funeral, including the current KMT leader [CHI.GetLeader] and several other persons. KMT members are mourning of his death, and [CHI.GetLeader] encourages KMT members to carry on with Liao's legacy and continue the struggle of revolutionary career."

While KMT members are mourning his death, [CHI.GetLeader] encourages KMT members to carry on Liao's legacy and continue the struggle of his revolutionary career."
chi_dom.4.a:0 "He will be missed."

chi_dom.5.t:0 "Incidents in Wenzhou"
chi_dom.5.d:0 "Occupation plans for Wenzhou and the other A.O.G. ports have been severely lacking compared to the meticulous steps and lines of advance drawn around Xiamen. When NRA forces occupied the city of Wenzhou, spontaneous anti-foreign riots began all across the city, leading to the murders of numerous German residents and the looting of much of the city's uptown districts. To complicate matters, several smaller advance groups of Nationalist troops also participated in the looting until more disciplined units arrived to secure the area. Wenzhou is now significantly damaged from the civil unrest."
chi_dom.5.a:0 "Another mess for our foreign secretary to sort out."

chi_dom.6.t:0 "Tragedy in Nantong"
chi_dom.6.d:0 "The port of Nantong had been leased by the League of Eight Provinces to the A.O.G., and its position at the mouth of the Yangzte allowed it to act as a German-exclusive alternative to the International City of Shanghai. The advancement of the NRA towards the treaty port caused mass panic and unrest among many of its residents. Widespread looting by Chinese natives combined with scorched-earth tactics by German security forces have lit up the sky above Nantong, and the ensuing fires have wiped out many of the textile factories. An exodus of ferries heading south towards Shanghai were overcrowded and unsuited to trips outside the Yangzte, leading to several of the boats capsizing with hundreds of deaths reported. Before the NRA could do anything to control the situation, it became clear that Nantong was a disaster area. Long seen as an exemplar of how Chinese cities could be modernized, Nantong has effectively been sacked."
chi_dom.6.a:0 "A great loss for the country."

chi_dom.7.t:0 "Fujianers in Hangzhou"
chi_dom.7.d:0 "Most of the National Revolutionary Army's first units were raised in Fujian Province from local peasants and the rare urban native, and few if any of these regular troops are familiar with the standard Mandarin dialect. Yesterday a group of Fujianer soldiers on leave in Hangzhou caused a scene when language difficulties and drunkenness led to a fight with local Hangzhou residents. Despite the view of China as one nation, language difficulties and the sharp contrast between rural and urban lifestyles will make stationing most units outside of their home areas difficult."
chi_dom.7.a:0 "It's an unavoidable problem of national unification."

chi_dom.8.t:0 "The Zhou Fohai Affair"
chi_dom.8.d:0 "The Yiguandao movement may be associated with Shandong province, but adherents can be found throughout China. At the 1929 Party Congress, the Kuomintang resolved that none of its members could also belong to any charismatic spiritual movements, chief among them being the Yiguandao. With the National Revolution now fighting against the forces of the Mad Mystic Zhang Tianran, the ZhongTeJu has begun extensive counter-intelligence sweeps to purge secret Yiguandao practitioners.\n\nThe most prominent secret Millenarian revealed so far has unexpectedly been Zhou Fohai, a Minquan faction member. Zhou has resigned all his posts under duress by the Central Committee and has now been expelled from the party. His accusation and arrest has caused a scandal within the Nationalist government."
chi_dom.8.a:0 "This is an embarrassment..."

chi_dom.9.t:0 "The Premiere of Mulan Cong Jun"
chi_dom.9.d:0 "Today saw the premiere of one of the first feature films created under Nationalist China's rule. Directed by Bu Wancang and with young Chen Yunchang playing the lead, Mulan Cong Jun (Mulan Joins the Army) is a historical period drama based on the legend of Hua Mulan, who in a show of filial piety joins the army in her father's place to fight off invading nomads. Hailing traditional virtues of honour and valour, the film was an immediate success and has raised patriotic feelings throughout the country, along with an inevitable flood of popular comparisons between Hua Mulan and Soong Qingling."
chi_dom.9.a:0 "How exciting!"

chi_dom.10.t:0 "The Premiere of The Spring River Flows East"
chi_dom.10.d:0 "Directed by Cai Chusheng and Zheng Junli, The Spring River Flows East is a two part epic movie depicting the hardships of a poor working class couple in Zhejiang during the trials and tribulations of the National Revolution. Portraying the corruption that greed and power holds over the people, the movie's message has been interpreted by many as a direct attack upon the moderate parties. However, the film has been a smashing success at the box office as well as with the critics."
chi_dom.10.a:0 "I say, it's the stuff that dreams are made of!"

chi_dom.18.t:0 "Sun Fo Splits the Minquan Faction"
chi_dom.18.d1:0 "The first Party Congress of the KMT ended with the Minsheng Faction keeping its leadership. After the Congress, the Right-Wing of the Minquan Faction, led by Sun Fo, blamed the Left-Wing of the Minquan Faction, under Song’s leadership, for being too lax during the struggle for the KMT leadership. This led to the long brewing conflict between them finally breaking out. After a fall out with no results, Sun Fo and his followers became angry and left, then declared the establishment of the Minzu faction. It seems that as the Minsheng Faction strengthens their control of central power and the tutelage, the Minquan Faction’s chances of gaining power are growing slim."
chi_dom.18.d2:0 "The first Party Congress of KMT ended with the Minquan Faction overtaking the Minsheng Faction as leaders of the KMT. After the Congress, the Right-Wing of the Minquan Faction, led by Sun Fo, discussed with the Left-Wing of the Minquan Faction their desire to become their own individual faction. Although Song Qingling tries to persuade them to stay in Minquan Faction, Sun Fo and his followers have decided to leave. It seems that if the Minquan Faction calls for an election, Sun Fo and his followers will participate as an independent faction."
chi_dom.18.a:0 "A pity."

chi_dom.19.t:0 "End of the First Repatriated Congress"
chi_dom.19.d1:0 "Now that the congress has officially concluded we must look to reclaiming China for the people. We have a series of reconstruction plans in mind to help prepare our industry to unify China as well as the reforms proposed at the congress to complete, we have quite the task ahead of us but we must succeed."

chi_dom.19.a:0 "Very well."

chi_dom.20.t:0 "The New Cabinet of Minquan-led KMT"
chi_dom.20.d:0 "We have a choice between two prominent members of the party to stand as the head of government. The first is the only living son of Chiang Kai-Shek, Chiang Ching-kuo who is already more than equipped to take on the job. The second is a newcomer Fang Yuxiang who is more left than Chiang Ching-Kuo due to her years of study in the Commune of France, if we wish to follow the Commune of France form government more closely she will be an excellent choice.  "
chi_dom.20.a:0 "Choose the veterans led by Chiang Ching-kuo."
chi_dom.20.b:0 "Choose the comrades led by Fang Junying."

chi_dom.21.t:0 "Two-Gun Cohen"
chi_dom.21.d:0 "Morris Abraham Cohen, otherwise known as Two-Gun Cohen, served in the Canadian Railway Troops during the Weltkrieg before eventually making his way to China to conduct business with Sun Yat-Sen. After bonding with him, Morris started working for the KMT, helping train troops until he was offered to become one of Sun Yat-Sens many bodyguards. He eventually got the name Two-Gun Cohen after one battle where he was nicked by a bullet and decided to always carry two guns with him. After going back to Canada due to the disastrous campaign of the Northern Expedition he has once again visited China offering the same protection that he gave Sun Yat-Sen."
chi_dom.21.a:0 "We will never need to watch our backs.."

chi_dom.22.t:0 "Chiang Wei-kuo Commissioned"
chi_dom.22.d:0 "With the formation of the Mechanized Warfare Study Commission, a recent graduate from the prestigious Kriegschule in Munich has been recalled home: None other than Chiang Wei-kuo, the late Chiang Kai-shek's second son. From his time in Germany, he not only trained with Germany's elite Gebirgsjäger, but learned about the latest ideas and experiments of mechanized warfare as he became a tank commander. He will certainly prove instrumental in the development of our armoured forces."
chi_dom.22.a:0 "He will help introduce new doctrine."

chi_dom.24.t:0 "Cooperation With Foreign Powers"
chi_dom.24.d:0 "It is true, China needs foreign aid to industrialise and so we must look to the syndicalist power of the world and see if they are willing to help us in our reconstruction."
chi_dom.24.a:0 "[ENG.GetNameDefCap] is the best choice"
chi_dom.24.b:0 "[CSA.GetNameDefCap] is the best choice"
chi_dom.24.c:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] is the best choice"

chi_dom.25.t:0 "A Request From China"
chi_dom.25.d:0 "The Nationalist government in China has come to us with an offer of cooperation in building up their industry, they suggest we share new innovations between each other for mutual aid. Whilst we may not gain many new technologies from China we can at least help them modernise."
chi_dom.25.a:0 "China has our support"
chi_dom.25.b:0 "We will not cooperate with the Kuomintang"

chi_dom.26.t:0 "Our Offer has Been Accepted"
chi_dom.26.d:0 "Now that our offer has been accepted we can now enjoy the benefits of working with a foreign power, as much as it may pain us to work with syndicalists it is better than working with Germany."
chi_dom.26.a:0 "A toast to our friendship"

chi_dom.28.t:0 "A Mysterious Letter"
chi_dom.28.d:0 "An encrypted letter was uncovered by accident by a party member. The letter is hand written and discussed in length how the current state of the party is unstable and in need of dire reform. The letter also goes onto the talk about a potential change in management of the party. Due to the heavy encryption of both the source and the recipient we can't track the letter down to any one person so we will have to remain vigilant."
chi_dom.28.a:0 "Let's hope this was a prank..."

chi_dom.29.t:0 "The Source"
chi_dom.29.d:0 "If the letter wasn't unsettling enough, we’ve caught the person who was the source of the letter. Even under heavy interrogation the person was reluctant to even speak a word about the letter, which doesn't give any hope that it is a small matter. We have no choice but to continue the interrogation until the information is given to us. This could take some time."
chi_dom.29.a:0 "This has to be a small conspiracy, right?"

chi_dom.30.t:0 "An Innocent Meeting"
chi_dom.30.d:0 "There are many people sitting around a large circular table. Many appear to be officers both old and new from Whampoa Military Academy whilst some are radicals not found in any high up positions of the party. Our spy was unable to gather anything beyond that, but he has his suspicions that there is a more sinister purpose to this meeting."
chi_dom.30.a:0 "We need to keep an eye on these meetings"
chi_dom.30.b:0 "This is nonsense, forget about the meeting."

chi_dom.31.t:0 "A Matter of State"
chi_dom.31.d:0 "The spy stayed a bit longer in the next weekly meeting of the group he has been informing us about and has come to us with urgent news. Like last time the conversation was the same until at a certain point all members of the meeting nodded slowly. After assuring each other that they were secure they began discussing in detail about the depth of the infiltration. As the discussion progressed the spy was alarmed when one officer had reportedly said that the plan will commence in less than a month. The spy had to hurry out of the building to avoid being spotted but this discussion was more than enough to incriminate those attending."
chi_dom.31.a:0 "Send a detachment of police to investigate."

chi_dom.32.t:0 "The Conclusion of the Investigation"
chi_dom.32.d:0 "The police who were sent to investigate the people attending the meeting have reported that nothing suspicions is going on and that the spy must have been lying. This is highly odd as he is one of our most trusted spies and would never lie to us, something must be going on here."
chi_dom.32.a:0 "What is going on!?"

chi_dom.33.t:0 "The plot is exposed"
chi_dom.33.d:0 "It seems like forever since we found that letter but after many days of work we have found out the person the letter was addressed to is none other than Dai Chunfeng!"
chi_dom.33.a:0 "This is a very serious matter, arrest him!"

chi_dom.34.t:0 "Dai Chunfeng Takes Control"
chi_dom.34.d:0 "The situation was far worse than we originally expected. Like the spy heard in the meeting the bureaucracy has been vastly infiltrated, with every element of it now loyal to Dai first and the party second. Whilst the reports are coming through the Spy knocks on the party leader’s door, after the door opens two soldiers are seen behind the spy and he whispers to us 'I am sorry'. With Dai's influence entrenched in every facet of life his coup has succeeded. "
chi_dom.34.a:0 "An unexpected turn of events."

chi_dom.35.t:0 "First National Elections"
chi_dom.35.d:0 "There have been many unelected leaders of the Kuomintang over the years, not even Sun was elected. They realised that the unstable position of the Kuomintang meant no elected leader would have the will nor the power to come out on top. Since Wang Jingwei rose up as an insurgent state we have evolved to a fully functioning democracy so it is only right that we hold elections. There are a few parties running such as the major Minsheng and Minquan but even parties like the Chinese Syndicalist Party and the Minzu are attempting to gain some support. The votes are coming through and both the Minquan and Minsheng are tied, the winner is..."
chi_dom.35.a:0 "The Minsheng secure a majority."
chi_dom.35.b:0 "The Minquan coalition manage to form a government."

chi_dom.36.t:0 "Chen Mingshu Claims National Leadership"
chi_dom.36.d:0 "Two times the Kuomintang have failed in establishing control over China, each time has been progressively worse. First the KMT lost the Northern Expedition, then they failed the revolt... now it is our turn to secure China. With Chen Mingshu and the potential for other leader of the KMT to remerge the future is bright. First however we must deal with the many problems that face Liangguang and then look outwards."
chi_dom.36.a:0 "A Toast to Chen."

chi_dom.37.t:0 "Soong Qingling Arrives"
chi_dom.37.d:0 "The infamous Soong Qingling has arrived to make sure the our KMT are seen as more legitimate to the rest of china, and the world. With her in a position of power we could truly stand a chance at uniting China, for the Republic!"
chi_dom.37.a:0 "Welcome Back Soong."

chi_dom.38.t:0 "Wang Jingwei Arrives"
chi_dom.38.d:0 "The Hero of the KMT, Wang Jingwei has also arrived to make sure the KMT are seen as more legitimate to the rest of china, and the world. With his prominence in the politics of China we could truly stand a chance at uniting China, for the Republic!"
chi_dom.38.a:0 "A Toast to Wang."

chi_dom.39.t:0 "Soong and Chen Disagree"
chi_dom.39.d:0 "Chen and Soong whilst technically belong to a similar ideological party have various differences which are seriously disrupting the re-establishment of the KMT. Chen believes that the revolution must include elements of Chen Jiongmings government if it is too truly survive whereas Soong insists that the KMT should stay with the policies of the last two versions of the KMT. Whatever comes out of these talks it is clear one of the two will have to garner support to keep their position."
chi_dom.39.a:0 "We can only hope they can solve their differences."

chi_dom.40.t:0 "Unrest in Guangdong"
chi_dom.40.d:0 "Whilst the political side of Chens removal is solidly behind Chen... on paper, the peasants are rioting at the new change in government. Before when the KMT used Guangdong as staging ground for the Northern Expedition at least Jiongming was around to placate them but without him the stability of the province is deteriorating."
chi_dom.40.a:0 "We must fix this."

chi_dom.41.t:0 "Soong and Chen Debate Further"
chi_dom.41.d:0 "Chen and Soong have been subtly critical of each other since the beginning however the two are now openly discussing who should be in charge of the Kuomintang. It seems the facade of unity has been chucked out of the window and the race to become leader has begun. The comfort we can take out of this is that the other agreed to not be a threat should one of them come out on top."
chi_dom.41.a:0 "We will take what little good news we can get."

chi_dom.42.t:0 "Unrest in Guangxi"
chi_dom.42.d:0 "The warlords in Guangxi have finally been defeated however the remnants of their clique are causing trouble in the area. Whilst they are certainly without any meaningful leadership it is perhaps best to put them out of their misery."
chi_dom.42.a:0 "They will be dealt with."

chi_dom.43.t:0 "Peasants Flee from the Fujian Base Area"
chi_dom.43.d:0 "The battle between Soong and Chen seems to have distracted us from the larger issue, the huge refugee problem to the east. Under normal conditions this would be fine however the lack of control we have risks these peasants causing trouble, already some incidents have occurred at the border. We can only watch for the time being..."
chi_dom.43.a:0 "This must be kept under control."

chi_dom.44.t:0 "More Peasants Flee from the Fujian Base Area"
chi_dom.44.d:0 "The huge refugee problem to the east has grown significantly. Double the amount of refugees since the last report have made it into the province with some of these peasants causing more trouble than before, something must be done about this issue soon."
chi_dom.44.a:0 "Something must be done!"

chi_dom.45.t:0 "The Toughest Decision"
chi_dom.45.d:0 "Chen has been troubled by these refugees as he feels it was our obligation to protect them during the Fujian Government however he has also recognised the issue that we face with the large influx of crime. He has a choice between trying to broker a peace with the peasants or forcing them all back to the Fujian Zone."
chi_dom.45.a:0 "They have only caused trouble."
chi_dom.45.b:0 "We need to appeal to the populace here."

chi_dom.46.t:0 "The Leadership Crisis has Begun "
chi_dom.46.d:0 "Chen and Soong are now going head to head to try and become leader of the Kuomintang. They will be trying to garner enough support from the party to be elected to the role of President which will have the duty of overseeing the foundation of a KMT China."
chi_dom.46.a:0 "They have only caused trouble."

chi_dom.47.t:0 "Chen Makes a Statement"
chi_dom.47.d:0 "Chen Mingshu has finally spoken on the issue of his continued presidency, whilst he isn't fully the President of the Republic he has been overseeing the peaceful transition from Federalism. In his speech Chen also mentions how he is dedicated to making the KMT rule China due to the fact he restored them."
chi_dom.47.a:0 "He makes a good point!"

chi_dom.48.t:0 "Soong Qinglings Speech"
chi_dom.48.d:0 "Soong starts of her speech by reminding people that she was married to Sun Yat-Sen and that she was also dedicated uniting China. She also says that this means she is committed to Sun Yat-Sens Policies and that she will realise his vision for China."
chi_dom.48.a:0 "A good speech!"

chi_dom.49.t:0 "Election Results Incoming"
chi_dom.49.d:0 "On the eve of the election results we await the announcement of who will lead the KMT too greatness. People have been highly supportive of both due to each of their positions but at the end of the day only one will make it on top. Despite their differences Soong walked up to Chen shaking his hands and wishing him 'Good Luck' which he reciprocated. This is most likely to show the unity of the government but some speculate they both genuinely respect each other part to play in China."
chi_dom.49.a:0 "I just can't sleep."

chi_dom.50.t:0 "The President Announced"
chi_dom.50.d:0 "The results are in and with the fate of the KMT... and China in the hands of the result many are eager to hear who came out on top. People suggest Chen might have due to his determination too unite China whilst other people make a note that some party members look high upon Soong due to her relationship with the Father of China, one thing for sure is that the winner is..."
chi_dom.50.a:0 "Chen Mingshu!"
chi_dom.50.b:0 "Soong Qingling"

chi_cng.1.t:0 "Call to Convene The National Congress"
chi_cng.1.d:0 "Many prominent members of the party have convened to discuss all matters of the state and organise the Kuomintang into a fully fledged government. The foundation for the congress will be the 1924 National Congress which was set up to organise the party into an official government. Subjects varying from reflection of past events to the status of syndicalist elements in our party will be discussed in length."
chi_cng.1.a:0 "Excellent."

chi_cng.2.t:0 "KMT votes on adopting official history of the 1st Northern Expedition"
chi_cng.2.d:0 "After much build up the Revolutionary Army marched north against the Zhilli in an effort to unify the country... this failed. Many points have been brought up such as the KMT lacking the peoples support or intervention from foreign powers, specifically Germany. We should decide which of these arguments are more compelling to use as the root cause of the failure to unify the country."
chi_cng.2.a:0 "Imperialists and traitors."
chi_cng.2.b:0 "Lack of support from the population."

chi_cng.3.t:0 "The Question of Ethnic Autonomy"
chi_cng.3.d:0 "Much of China outside the 18 Provinces has effectively become independent, and there are many ethnic separatist movements. Our goal is to unite all the territory of the old Qing back into a single Chinese nation - would the adoption of federalized ethnic zones inside a greater China allow for the security and allegiance of non-Han peoples?"
chi_cng.3.a:0 "No. China must be truly unified."
chi_cng.3.b:0 "Yes. It is the best way to reunifying the country."

chi_cng.4.t:0 "The Question of Syndicalist Parties"
chi_cng.4.d:0 "The KMT's party program for developing China plans that only the KMT will be allowed to exist as a full political party for the period of Political Tutelage. As a precondition of Syndicalist aid, we have made exemptions for the Chinese Syndicalist Party and several other minor urban syndicalist groups. Should the Syndicalist parties be given an exception to the ban on public recruitment in the realm of organizing urban labour?"
chi_cng.4.a:0 "No. Tutelage must extend to labour relations."
chi_cng.4.b:0 "Yes. Chinese labour should be able to choose to join Syndicalist-aligned unions."

chi_cng.5.t:0 "Status of Whampoa Academy"
chi_cng.5.d:0 "The Whampoa Military Academy is long gone however many in our government and military wish to see it brought back, it is hard to disagree with this point as our army is woefully behind many of our competitors. If we bring it back we can begin to once again have a strong army which will make our victory over China all but assured. With all the put to rest we have two questions, do we either restore it as it was before or give it a modern touch as warfare has changed since the time of the expedition."
chi_cng.5.a:0 "We will simply restore the Academy."
chi_cng.5.b:0 "A new academy for a new China!"

chi_cng.6.t:0 "Direction of the NRA"
chi_cng.6.d:0 "With our consolidation over Southern China, several ideas of how to conduct warfare have emerged. Two ideas have emerged as most prominent, with the first being the possibility of using our vast manpower as our strength. This isn't particularly unique among the armies in China, however, there is nothing wrong with using a reliable method. The second idea is the modernisation of our armies, which will ensure that when it comes to fighting, our soldiers will be far superior compared to the enemy. What shall we go with?"
chi_cng.6.a:0 "Manpower is key to unifying China"
chi_cng.6.b:0 "Modernization is key to unifying China"

chi_cng.7.t:0 "A Reflection of Previous Leaders"
chi_cng.7.d:0 "We can all agree that both Sun Yat Sen and Chiang Kai-Shek did a lot for the KMT. Where it is up for interpretation is whether these figures were good for China. Of course Sun Yat-Sen had many amazing qualities however he seemed desperate to hold onto power, this could also be interpreted as him trying to make sure the KMT survives. Chiang Kai-Shek is up for debate as he did a lot for the military however he also oversaw the disaster of the Northern Expedition."
chi_cng.7.a:0 "They are both the Father and Son of China"
chi_cng.7.b:0 "Both were good for China but perhaps we could downplay how much"

chi_cng.8.t:0 "Report on the JiangFu Government"
chi_cng.8.d:0 "Song Qingling has been the acting governor of Fujian province and the JiangFu zone for much of the last ten years. Her administration has, through creating a form of locally-run one-party democracy, created an alternative vision for how the National Revolution can be done that opposes the top-down nature of the Wang Jingwei program. Minsheng faction members criticize the idea of the JiangFu program being expanded to all of China as being impractical, but its implementation has proven economically and militarily successful and very popular with Fujian province locals."
chi_cng.8.a:0 "Adopt a token resolution praising Song's administration."
chi_cng.8.b:0 "Officially recognize the JiangFu experiment as a success."

chi_cng.9.t:0 "Review of the War of Five Provinces"
chi_cng.9.d:0 "A review of the current status of the National Liberation Zone and its recent expansion out of JiangFu after the last campaign has been drafted by the NRA. The general consensus of all involved advises caution in moving north against the Zhili too soon. A majority of the NRA's old guard favors focusing on reunifying southern China before daring to cross the Huai, but the Young Guard and their allies in the civilian KMT such as Zhou Enlai advise an opportunistic stance towards an inevitable war between the Zhili clique and itself or Fengtian."
chi_cng.9.a:0 "Favor regional unification"

chi_cng.10.d1:0 "After the series of debates during the Congress Wang Jingwei has secured his control over the Kuomintang and will now serve as the leader of the republic. He will begin to implement the many reforms that were proposed to modernise our nation into a force that can unify this broken country."
chi_cng.10.d2:0 "After the series of debates during the Congress the Minquan faction has secured a majority and have taken over the Kuomintang to serve as the leaders of the republic. We shall begin to implement the many reforms that were proposed to modernise our nation into a force that can unify this broken country."
chi_cng.10.a:0 "Chairman Wang’s policy is always right."
chi_cng.10.b:0 "The Minquan will bring new energy to the Committee."

chi_cng.11.t:0 "Call to Convene The Second National Congress"
chi_cng.11.d:0 "With key cities such as Beijing and Nanjing under our control it is now time to convene a second congress and discuss new important issues. Many prominent members of the party have convened to discuss all matters of the state and organise the Kuomintang into the true power in China. Subjects such as our position in China and the fate of our wartime policies will be discussed in length."
chi_cng.11.a:0 "Excellent."

chi_cng.12.t:0 "The Question of Taxes"
chi_cng.12.d:0 "The KMT has imposed some fairly high taxes since the first congress despite promising not to. This was hidden by the fact the KMT wasn't in a good position at the time, now with our capture of both Nanjing and Beijing the people have seen that they are not necessary any more. We can either ease the taxes a little or keep them in place for the time being..."
chi_cng.12.a:0 "We are still in a dangerous position?"
chi_cng.12.b:0 "We must ease their burden."

chi_cng.13.t:0 "Formation of a Permanent Capital"
chi_cng.13.d:0 "With many key cities secured we plan a future event to discuss where the permanent capital of China should be. Many people brought this up as it is an issue of great contention with arguments to move the capital to the newly captured city of Beijing to even Wuhan, the birth of the revolution."
chi_cng.13.a:0 "We will certainly put some thought into this."

chi_cng.14.t:0 "The Reintegration of the North"
chi_cng.14.d:0 "The KMT's influence in the North of China has always been minimal so we must make an effort to bring the various warlords there under our control and perhaps give them a show of force. Some ministers brought up the possibility of securing parts of east Asia and even Russian territories, whilst they were laughed at the idea of securing foreign territories it might be vital to make sure imperialist influence doesn't spread to any further."
chi_cng.14.a:0 "The North must be pacified."

chi_cng.15.t:0 "End of the Congress"
chi_cng.15.d:0 "With the key cities of Beijing and Nanjing under our control we can now prove to the rest of the world that we are the legitimate government and that they should support us. Now with the Northern Expedition over it is at last our turn to play the role of Beijing Government."
chi_cng.15.a:0 "The Northern Expedition has been avenged."

chi_for.1.t:0 "Support from KMT Centre"
chi_for.1.d1:0 "The Kuomintang Central Committee in Fujian province has expressed its willingness to support us in fighting against those traitorous Old Gui clique. Although some of our generals and officials believe that accepting their assistance will make us gradually submit to them, for us, their support will indeed bring great help in the war against Ma Ji."
chi_for.1.d2:0 "The KMT Central Committee in Fujian region has unexpectedly showed their support for us against the Federalists and Merchants. Most oppose connecting with the left-wing KMT Central Committee with Wang Jingwei as its leader because they betrayed us critically during the Guangxi War. However, as we have to face the threat of Guangdong Clique as well,  it would be much easier for us to win the war if we accept this aid... temporarily."

chi_for.2.d1:0 "After a period of silence, the KMT troops in Liangguang finally showed their will to receive our support. Maybe the process of making this decision is tortuous or even arduous, but in the name of Revolution, nothing is insurmountable. And now, the good news has been spread among our soldiers and workers, which makes everyone working hard overtime and only wishing more goods could be delivered to our brothers in Liangguang safely."
chi_for.2.d2:0 "\"Unbelievable!\" is the only sound that remains after short silence and huge, violent burst of noise in Kuomintang Central Committee. No matter why, how could those Liangguang tsheh-laus decide to refuse our true kindness and not consider that this is about the revolution? Not only does this shock the Committee members, but it also ignites a huge wave of dissent in our population. Although there are voices demanding expulsion of the entirety of Liangguang Kuomintang, our leader said that Liangguang Kuomintang are still our brother in the revolution and the only reason that they refuse the support is because they don't want to increase the burden on the Central Committee."

chi_for.3.t:0 "A Provisional Capital in Nanjing?"
chi_for.3.d:0 "With the conquest of Jiangsu from the remnants of the Southern Zhili, we have secured the great prize of Nanjing. The city is the historical capital of several dynasties, was the centre of the League of Eight Provinces, and the favoured permanent capital of many in the KMT. Longyan is small and isolated, which helped the insurgency survive, but now this fact doesn't help the KMT's civil and military administration. It may be prudent to move our government to Nanjing until our final capital is determined."

Longyan is small and isolated, which helped the insurgency survive, but now this fact doesn't help the KMT's civil and military administration. It may be prudent to move our government to Nanchang until our final capital is determined."

These partisan activities are reportedly the work of Kuomintang operatives working inside our territory, but so far our security officers have only apprehended individual agents. Disturbingly enough, these attacks are only focused on troops and resources intended for our struggle against [CHI.GetNameDef], indicating that they have a high level of intelligence about our army's daily movements.\n\nFrontline reports indicate that the Kuomintang is planning to initiate a major offensive against us."

CHI_military_expeditions_category_desc:0 "After the disastrous failure of the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang's internal unity literally and figuratively split along ideological lines. While the subordinate right-wing faction found refuge with the southern warlords, the Left KMT was been reduced to an insurgency in south-east China and a government-in-exile in Paris. The last ten years have seen few openings to re-establish a rival government, but the consensus is that the next attempt must fully embrace social revolution.

CHI_expandthepowerofthezhongteju:0 "Expand the Power of the ZhongTeJu"
CHI_expandthepowerofthezhongteju_desc:0 "The severe threats that have threatened our government in the past few months have made it clear that the ZhongTeJu and the civil police need more power to deal with any state-destructive machinations by our enemies. We will now implement Chairman Dais plan, which he presented at the ZhongTeJu meeting."

CHI_startatruthandreconciliationcampaign:0 "Baihua Qifang"
CHI_startatruthandreconciliationcampaign_desc:0 "We will launch a national campaign called 'Baihua Qifang' (Hundred Flowers Movement) which encourages all citizens to openly criticize our government and make suggestions for improvement. Chairman Dai said that he and the party leadership are already 'very excited' about what proposals they will get from the population. The campaign is scheduled to run for six months, after which the results will be evaluated."

CHI_anewinterpretationofthethreeprinciples:0 "A new Interpretation of the Three Principles"
CHI_anewinterpretationofthethreeprinciples_desc:0 "Dr. Suns three principles have served us well in the past to create a better China, but their interpretation is simply out of date to continue to benefit us. The Kuomintang Central Committee will revise the meaning of the three principles so that we can build a modern and better China."

CHI_establishmentofreeducationcamps:0 "Establishment of 'Re-Education Camps'"
CHI_establishmentofreeducationcamps_desc:0 "There will always be people who don't want to take the easy way of submission and adaptation to the circumstances. We set up special 'Re-Education Camps' for these people, where they are taught correct thinking and good behavior."

CHI_daisruleoftheironfist:0 "Dai's Rule of the Iron Fist"
CHI_daisruleoftheironfist_desc:0 "Chairman Dai has accomplished what no one has done before him: He has fully united China under his rule of the Iron Fist! It is now clear to all citizens that without Chairman Dai there is no strong China! \nChairman Dai today! \nChairman Dai tomorrow! \nChairman Dai forever!"

CHI_chiangsnewnra:0 "Chiang's New NRA"
CHI_chiangsnewnra_desc:0 "The NRA is now only a shadow of itself after the coup. Many soldiers and officers no longer trust each other, which weakens our moral and operational ability. Generalissimo Chiang has ordered an extensive reform program to be implemented to restore the effectiveness of the NRA."

CHI_chiangsbennevolentdictatorship:0 "Chiang's Benevolent Rule"
CHI_chiangsbennevolentdictatorship_desc:0 "Generalissimo Chiang's renewed path to the top was long and difficult. He saved China from the brutal tyrant Dai Chunfeng just in time and the people are grateful for that. True democracy may still be far away, but Chiang's rule is not unjust, it's a progressive and benevolent one that can be described as tough but fair. Under his rule, China can become a stable place of progress and democracy in the future."

CHI_expandthenewlifemovement:0 "Expand the New Life Movement"
CHI_expandthenewlifemovement_desc:0 "The New Life Movement implemented under Dai Chunfeng was arguably one of the few good things he did during his reign. The success of the movement proves that we should continue to finance it to bring China further into the modern age."

CHI_anintelligenceagencywithastate:0 "An Intelligence Agency with a State"
CHI_anintelligenceagencywithastate_desc:0 "Even if we keep the appearance of democracy on the outside, it is clear to almost everyone in the world that the decisions are no longer made by the chinese people, but by the ZhongTeJu Central Committee and Dai Chunfeng. No citizen or foreigner can do anything in China without the ZhongTeJu being aware of it. Abroad, our state is already referred to as 'An Intelligence Agency with a State', something that Chairman Dai amused took note of."

CHI_abolishthelegislativeyuan:0 "Abolish the Legislative Yuan"
CHI_abolishthelegislativeyuan_desc:0 "The Legislative Yuan is still a thorn in our side even after we took power. The little hope of 'democracy' and 'freedom' it embodies must come to an end! In the future, the National Assembly will take over the tasks of the Legislative Yuan and serve as a dummy parliament."

CHI_eliminateinternaltroublemakers:0 "Eliminate Internal Troublemakers"
CHI_eliminateinternaltroublemakers_desc:0 "Some people in the party, government or the military, are still loyal to the old government and cause problems with their loose mouths. We need to silence these people as soon as possible to avoid further incidents."

CHI_thegeneralissimohasrisenfromthedead:0 "The Generalissimo has Risen from the Dead!"
CHI_thegeneralissimohasrisenfromthedead_desc:0 "The shock in the country is great after Generalissimo Chiang has "risen from the dead" in the eyes of the public and is now our head of state.

CHI_daiconsolidateshispower:0 "Dai Consolidates his Power"
CHI_daiconsolidateshispower_desc:0 "Dais ultimate goal is now within reach. Even though his anger at Chiang's hideous treachery is great, he can now continue with his plan. The elimination of our enemies and absolute power will be achieved shortly."

CHI_partymonument:0 "Build the Monument to Party Founding"
CHI_partymonument_desc:0 "Our leading party ideologists have suggested that for propaganda purposes it would be excellent if we built a monument that would show the glorious successes of the party and its great leaders. We could then hold large party events or state acts there. However, we can only implement such a project when our government is fully stabilized."

CHI_meetingofseniorzhongtejumembers:0 "Meeting of Senior ZhongTeJu Members"
CHI_meetingofseniorzhongtejumembers_desc:0 "A meeting of senior ZhongTeJu members will be held at which Chairman Dai will announce his government's plans for the future course for China."

### Political Events ###

chi_tot.1.t:0 "Chairman Dai announces a meeting of the ZhongTeJu leadership"
chi_tot.1.d:0 "Chairman Dai announced in a secret message to all senior ZhongTeJu officials that a leadership congress will be held in the capital in two weeks. At the conference, he wants to give new instructions to his subordinates and talk about other important topics. \n\nHowever, the letter also states that anyone who should not be present or lose a single word about what will be said at the conference will be executed immediately."
chi_tot.1.a:0 "Um, well, then we should rather accept Dai's friendly invitation pretty quickly..."

chi_tot.2.t:0 "ZhongTeJu Conference: Day 1"
chi_tot.2.d:0 "After all conference attendees arrived and took their seats, Chairman Dai stood up to deliver his opening speech: \n'My comrades, not too long ago we saved the state and the party from the total collapse that the previous, incompetent party leadership had endured through their erratic leadership. China must never come into such a situation again if we want that the party state can survive! \nTherefore, I hereby announce that the government will implement far-reaching reforms in the near future that will ensure that every citizen is fully committed to the state. We will achieve this by expanding the ZhongTeJu and giving the civil police more powers. \nThe goal must be that the party knows at all times where each citizen is and what he is doing at the moment. The details will be discussed later today.' \n\nDai paused for a moment and he began to grin in amusement, then he continued: \n\n'Unfortunately, not all of those present here will see our plan continue, some have stupidly allowed themselves outrageous comments against me and my government, which I consider to be opositional and counterrevolutionary thinking, which will be punished with full severity.' \n\nAfter Dai finished his speech, a dozen of the conference participants were roughly grabbed by the Chairman's bodyguards and dragged out of the room, while Dai comfortably drank a whiskey and talked to a few officers and party members. \n\nA short time later, a few shots were heard from outside, but nobody in the hall knowingly took note of it, because whoever should also anger the Chairman ends up like those poor bastards outside."
chi_tot.2.a:0 "Did anyone hear anything? No? Well! Let's have a whiskey with Chairman Dai!"

chi_tot.3.t:0 "ZhongTeJu Conference: Day 2 (Part 1)"
chi_tot.3.d:0 "The second day of the conference was actually quite normal compared to yesterday, but there was a certain tension among those present in the hall. Because everyone knew what happened yesterday and the Dai announced that he wanted to share top secret information with them today. Shortly after the lunch break, Chairman Dai spoke again: \n\n'My comrades, as I announced yesterday, it’s time to reveal the real reason why I have called this conference in the first place. Our whole operation of overthrowing the previous government was only possible because, in addition to infiltrating the bureaucracy through our ZhongTeJu, we had help with strategic planning and the elimination of the risk of a reaction from the NRA, namely through this familiar face! Come out of the shadow, Marshal Chiang!' \n\nAt that moment, behind the lectern at which Dai stands, a man in a black uniform, with sunglasses, a face completely scarred, and with the rank badge of a ZhongTeJu Marshal stepped out of the shadows. \nEven though it is not easy to see due to the many wounds, it is no doubt Chiang Kai-shek is now standing next to Dai Chunfeng. \nEveryone in the room was paralyzed with shock, because nobody could believe that Marshal Chiang, who died during the German intervention, should really be standing up there on the Podeum. \n\nChiang smiled and went to the lectern beside Dai: \n\n'Greetings to you all, my former friends and comrades, it's been a while since I saw the faces of some of you here for the last time. Some of you will probably be asking yourself: \nHow is that possible? Why is he still alive?"
chi_tot.3.a:0 "It's actually quite simple:"

chi_tot.4.t:0 "ZhongTeJu Conference: Day 2 (Part 2)"
chi_tot.4.d:0 "First the how: I owe it to my friend Dai Chunfeng that I can stand here in front of you today and nobody else. \nAnd now why: I didn't die during the intervention like the foreign press hastily announced, no, the assassins who were after me seriously wounded me and left me there to die, not knowing that I wasn’t dead. I somehow made it out of there, but had completely lost my memory. I no longer knew where I came from or who I was. I was so disfigured by my wounds on my face and whole body that no one recognized me whom I met while aimlessly roaming the country. \n\nA simple peasant family called Hu from Hunan took me in after they found me starving in a dirty ditch and took pity on me. They gave me food, a job in their fields and a place to sleep. The father of the family gave me the name Hu Changning because I couldn't remember my own. \nAfter that, five years went by until I was approached by a man in a hooded coat one day while I was doing my work in the field. He spoke to me and asked: 'Old friend, it is nice to see you again.' \n\nThat man was Dai Chunfeng. \n\n'He helped me regain my memory and secretly included me in the ranks of the ZhongTeJu. \nI have been hiding until today so that the disgusting Germans have no reason to invade China again. \nBut now that China has become a power to take on the western imperialists, Dai and I have decided that it is time to at least reveal to the people present here in this room, that I'm alive.' \n\nThe shock among the ZhongTeJu members continued as Chiang ended his speech and took a seat next to Dai. They still couldn’t believe what just happened. \n\nThe conference will continue tomorrow morning as everyone has to digest this overwhelming revelation first."
chi_tot.4.a:0 "What?! How did the Chairman manage to hide Chiang from us for so long?!"

chi_tot.5.t:0 "ZhongTeJu Conference: Day 3"
chi_tot.5.d:0 "After yesterday's shock, the third day of the conference began. Chiang Kai-shek was now one of the people in the room, sitting at the front of the same table as Chairman Dai. \n\nIn a five-hour speech, the chairman outlined his plan for permanent pacification across China. He said that it had been tolerated for far too long that many of our former enemies are still at large or in exile. In his view, China cannot be safe from these people's destructive ideas until they are in custody. Because if these people somehow manage to regain influence and incite people against our rule, our country will again face massive unrest. That is why the ZhongTeJu and the national civil police are given extensive powers by the Kuomintang Central Committee to maintain order in the country. \n\nDai also ordered that every senior member and leader of the federalists, the Fengtian government, the Qing Empire, the Zhili clique, influential warlords with secessionist ambitions, the Yiguandao cult, and the left and right Kuomintang be arrested immediately . To be on the safe side, these people's families are also detained for the time being until we have decided what to do with them. \n\nAfter the rest of the speakers had also finished their lectures, the conference was closed by Chairman Dai shortly before midnight. In his closing remarks he reminded everyone present that he expected absolute silence about everything discussed here and that all of his instructions were to be implemented immediately."
chi_tot.5.a:0 "Applause for the party and Chairman Dai!"

chi_tot.6.t:0 "NRA Coup: Attack on the Capital!"
chi_tot.6.d:0 "The streets of the capital were almost deserted, only a few people could be seen running across the streets. \n\nChairman Dai yesterday announced martial law for the entire city and imposed a curfew. And on the city's main squares and main streets, the NRA and ZhongTeJu have set up barricades and checkpoints as if they were expecting an attack. \n\nThe tension in the whole city had been unbearable all day and the soldiers looked extremely nervous. \n\nThen in the early afternoon, hell broke out over the city. At some checkpoints on the outskirts of the city, the NRA soldiers started shooting ZhongTeJu troops and opening the barricades. Whereupon further NRA units advanced towards the city center, which were strategically positioned in the villages and forests around the city. \n\nHowever, the ZhongTeJu and loyal NRA units quickly reorganized and intercepted the rebel NRA units only a few hundred meters later and embroiled them in violent battles. \n\nAccording to reports, Chiang Kai-shek was seen in one of the attacking armored vehicles as they set up their command post in a school building."
chi_tot.6.a:0 "And so the fight for the capital begins"

chi_tot.7.t:0 "NRA Coup: Fight for the Capital's Airport!"
chi_tot.7.d:0 "After the putschists were able to advance into the city through the betrayal of some NRA units on the outskirts of the city, our scouts identified their first target: \n\nThe putschists are advancing towards the airport to cut off our air supply! Some loyal troops have already been stationed there to ward off the attack. A little later the attackers arrived and started firing at our troops. \n\nAfter a few hours of fierce fighting, a message came in from one of our forward command posts that said:"
chi_tot.7.a:0 "The loyal troops repelled the attackers and defended the airport!"
chi_tot.7.b:0 "The putschists smashed our defense and took the airport!"

chi_tot.8.t:0 "NRA Coup: Siege of the Capital's Central Station!"
chi_tot.8.d:0 "After the battle for the airport, the putschists are now moving towards the central station to cut us off completely from any supply! \n\nOur soldiers have already dug trenches there and stationed machine guns to ward off possible attacks. \nFortunately, the number of attackers was less than that of our defenders and the two units facing each other are about the same strength, our loyal troops have the manpower advantage, but our opponents use tanks, it remained to be seen who was stronger. \n\nIn the course of the battle it became clear after a few hours who had the upper hand:"
chi_tot.8.a:0 "The loyal troops successfully defended the Central Station!"
chi_tot.8.b:0 "The Central Station falls into the hands of the putschists!"

chi_tot.9.t:0 "NRA Coup: Fight for the KMT Central Committee building!"
chi_tot.9.d:0 "Even before the battle for Central Station was over, the coup leaders launched a frontal attack on the Kuomitang Central Committee building. \n\nBy conquering the building, the putschists apparently wanted to reckon the morale of our defending troops so that they could advance into the city more easily. \n\nThe fighting lasted most of the day, but shortly before sunset it became clear that:"
chi_tot.9.a:0 "The loyal troops defended the Central Committee building!"
chi_tot.9.b:0 "The putschists conquered the Central Committee building!"

chi_tot.10.t:0 "NRA Coup: Attack on the Capital Garrison!"
chi_tot.10.d:0 "Bad news! \n\nWhile we paid attention to the defense of the Central Committee, a unit of the putschists managed to advance to the garrison of the capital and start an attack on it! \n\nWe had to withdraw troops from the surrounding fronts to defend the Granision. Unfortunately, the enemy managed to penetrate the complex's forecourt before our troops could counterattack! \n\nEven after several hours of fighting, shots were still heard from the building complex and it was difficult to get information about the status of the troops, but now we are certain that:"
chi_tot.10.a:0 "The Garrison was successfully defended by the loyal troops!"
chi_tot.10.b:0 "The Garrison and the Equipment there fell into the hands of the putschists!"

chi_tot.11.t:0 "NRA Coup: Siege of ZhongTeJu Headquarters!"
chi_tot.11.d:0 "It came as it had to come: the fighting in the city had now reached the ZhongTeJu headquarters, where Dai Chunfeng was staying and organizing the city's defense. \n\nThe main forces of the two parties to the conflict now faced each other in the streets and squares around the building and fought a bitter battle. No one on both sides was willing to back down now because everyone was aware of the importance of the building. If ZhongTeJu headquarters falls, it would put Dai Chunfeng in a pretty bad position, but if the attack is repelled, the attackers' main forces would be severely weakened. \n\nShortly before midnight, one side finally managed to strike the decisive blow:"
chi_tot.11.a:0 "The loyal troops defended the building and are now preparing to counterattack!"
chi_tot.11.b:0 "Dai Chunfeng fled the building with his retreating loyal troops to reorganize!"

chi_tot.12.t:0 "The dust begins to settle..."
chi_tot.12.d:0 "Now that only a few small battles are taking place in the entire city area and the fire brigade has started to put out the fires in the buildings, a victorious side has now emerged as the dust begins to settle. \n\nAfter evaluating several reports, it can be said that..."
chi_tot.12.a:0 "...the Coup was..."

chi_tot.13.t.dai:0 "...a failure! And Chiang Kai-shek has been arrested!"
chi_tot.13.t.kai_shek:0 "...a success! And Dai Chunfeng has been arrested!"
chi_tot.13.d.dai:0 "Outstanding work! Execute all these traitors on the spot! But bring Chiang directly to the Chairman, he wants to personally execute him!\n\nAnd congratulations to our loyal soldiers! Long live the party! Long live the Chairman!"
chi_tot.13.d.kai_shek:0 "Cheers to our success! Arrest all followers of Dai's government and disarm the NRA units that fought for him! Make sure Dai Chunfeng is safely housed in a cell until we can bring him to court!"

chi_tot.13.b:0 "The day is ours! Long live the Generalissimo!"

chi_tot.14.t:0 "Dai Chunfeng consolidates his power!"
chi_tot.14.d:0 "Dai was sitting in a meeting room with some of his closest allies, reflecting on the coup a few days ago, and was certain that the past few days were perhaps the greatest and probably the final threat to his rule over China. Then he spoke: \n'You will probably wonder why I called you here, gentlemen. And you may be wondering why I am not celebrating the victory over Chiang's coup. But if you thought about it, it is actually quite simple: such a one Treachery like that of Chiang, a man I saved and trusted, cannot have been planned without help from the inside! Chiang died yesterday by my hand, but that's not the end of it! There are people sitting at this table , who have rather stuffed their pockets and celebrated large parties in the past few years instead of doing their job properly!' \nDai hit the table with full force. \n 'Please tell me how it can be that military units like Chiang's can be strategically positioned around and in the capital without being noticed!' \nEveryone at the table was silent. \nWell, I have found some evidence that some of you have been offered bribes and a safe escape from China by the coup leaders if you in return make me fall into the hands of Chiang! Would anyone like to contradict me?' \nSome of the attendees were visibly nervous when Dai paused to look around. \nThen Dai snapped his finger and his guards pulled out their guns and shot everyone in the room except a general and two senior ZhongTeJu administrators. Then Dai spoke again: 'I hope the three of you now understand the terrible consequences of disobedience. You now have a choice, you will either continue to serve me as a loyal subordinate, or I will kill and replace you as well. And so that it is clear: China is mine and only mine and everyone who wants to contest it will end up like the dead traitors here in the room!'"
chi_tot.14.a:0 "Everyone is happy to accept Dais's kind offer! Long live the Chairman!"

chi_tot.15.t:0 "Generalissimo Chiang's first public appearance!"
chi_tot.15.d:0 "Thousands of people had gathered in front of the Kuomintang Central Committee building this morning because the new Chairman wanted to address the nation. None of the audience knew exactly who this new chairman actually was. It was only a few days since Dai Chunfeng was arrested and the NRA coup was over, and order had not yet been fully restored in and around the capital. Still everyone was excited to find out who had defied and overthrown the tyrant Dai. \nAfter the square and the street in front of the Central Committee were almost overcrowded, a person finally stepped onto the balcony of the building. People were a little shocked when they saw that it was a terribly disfigured man in uniform who was now standing up there. Then he started to speak and the voice sounded strangely familiar: \n'I greet you warmly, ladies and gentlemen! Thank you for showing up here today, despite the difficult situation! As you have probably already learned, Dai Chunfeng and his followers were arrested for their crimes against the Chinese people and I was elected new Chairman.' \nBy now, pretty much everyone had realized that the man on the balcony was none other than the believed dead Chiang Kai-shek! \n'I understand your shocking that I suddenly reappear, even though everyone thought I was killed during the German intervention. But I can assure you that I was never killed, I had only completely lost my memory. I don't want to lengthen this speech unnecessarily today and therefore I have only one request to all of you: Please help me and the party to lead China out of this dark, difficult time by keeping everyone calm and helping with the reconstruction. Trust the government and give us some time, we will make sure that every citizen can live safely and freely! A new democratization will take place as soon as China is stable again! Thank you for your attention!'"
chi_tot.15.a:0 "The... the Generalissimo lives?!"

chi_tot.16.t:0 "Replacement of the Legislative Yuan"
chi_tot.16.d:0 "The seats in the Legislative Yuan, the parliament of the Chinese National State, have now largely been filled with our loyal followers and put on government line, but there are still some politicians from other KMT factions who are aggressively opposing our government there. Even if these politicians no longer have political power, their words still reach our people. We cannot tolerate this any longer! For this reason, the Chairman of the Legislative Yuan proposed a bill that would combine the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan and the Kuomintang Central Committee to save costs and personnel. This new body will then become known as the Supreme National Assembly and will have 3,000 seats. It will manage both the executive and the legislature under the direct leadership of the President, who is also the Chairman of the KMT and head of ZhongTeJu. Opposition politicians condemned this proposal as dictatorial and autocratic and that it was only an attempt to destroy democracy and centralize power on Dai Chunfeng. They protested until just before the vote, but it didn't help them. The law was adopted by an absolute majority of the votes of the members of the now abolished Legislative Yuan. The critical politicians have thus finally lost their seats and their remaining influence, since the members of the Supreme National Assembly can only be appointed on the proposal of the Examination Yuan and the President himself."
chi_tot.16.a:0 "The Supreme National Assembly brings stability!"

chi_tot.17.t:0 "The Hundred Flowers Campaign"
chi_tot.17.d:0 "As discussed in advance by the Central Committee, the Hundred Flowers Movement is being launched today. For the duration of the campaign, all citizens of the country can send their criticism or suggestions for improvement directly to the government by sending a letter with name and address to the President's office. After half a year, all letters sent should then be evaluated and then a plan drawn up to implement the best ideas. \n\nChairman Dai just remarked again that it is really important that everyone who writes a letter should give their exact address so that it will be easier to find and reward the citizens if one of their ideas is implemented! \n\nMany intellectuals and critics, who have so far been hiding out of fear, welcome the campaign and agreed to participate in it. Others sense a deadly trap and call on their colleagues to be careful! What a nonsense! \n\nChairman Dai also said at the end of the campaign opening ceremony: 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend!'"
chi_tot.17.a:0 "Please write a lot of letters! We 'really' want to hear the opinion of the people!"

chi_tot.18.t:0 "The Chinese Surveillance State"
chi_tot.18.d:0 "Chairman Dai has done what no one in China's modern history has done before: he has united China under the banner of a single central government. But he is not yet satisfied with the success. \n\nf we have learned one thing from the events of the past few months, it is that we cannot trust our citizens. \nWe can no longer tolerate our citizens putting their so-called 'personal freedom' or their 'families' above the interests of the state, the party and the chairman. All citizens must understand that their lives now belong to the state. \n\nFor this reason, Chairman Dai has been able to extend the state of emergency by decree, abolish all citizens and human rights and have ordered the ZhongTeJu and the police to take even harder action against our enemies. The measures we have already taken may be extremely harsh, but as we have seen during the Hundred Flowers Movement, it has not been enough to make all critics tremble with fear and finally silence them. Therefore, from now on, all citizens will be divided into categories and evaluated using a points system. All who have a high score and are loyal can live a good life, but all those who accumulate minus points will be 'sorted out' for the good of all. Our country will only be absolutely perfect if the state, the people and the party act as one. \n\n\nA new morning dawns for China, but this morning does not belong to the Chinese people, it belongs solely to Chairman Dai."
chi_tot.18.a:0 "The future belongs only to those who have fought hard for it! Long live the Chairman!"

chi_tot.19.t:0 "The Fate of Dai Chunfeng"
chi_tot.19.d:0 "'China has regained its freedom! Down with the traitor Dai! ' These were the words on the front page of many major daily newspapers that have resumed their work. \n\nThe coup is not too long ago, but the people are already in a spirit of optimism because they have confidence again and the tyrant Dai has been deposed. \n\nAt the moment, Dai Chunfeng is sitting in a high security cell waiting for his execution. The judgment was already foreseeable in the eyes of many, because treason is almost always punished with death by the Supreme Military Court. \n\nThe moment of his execution had come a few days after the verdict. Dai and a few of his most loyal followers, who were also sentenced to death, were taken to the gallows, where they were hanged shortly afterwards. The court denied the criminals the right to have final words before the execution. \n\nThis is how the dark chapter of Dai Chunfeng's tyrannical dictatorship ends. Now the Chinese people under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek and the NRA can take a new path to a better future. Chiang has announced that he will temporarily lead a military government and appoint a new interim government in a few months."

It was only through the strength of our citizens and our NRA's loyalty to the constitution that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek succeeded in overthrowing the tyrant Dai and restoring order. Chiang would like to deliver a speech to Nation today announcing the new course for China: \n\n'My friends! I want to thank you all for your hard work in the past months, without your help it wouldn't have been possible to stabilize the country again! I can't deny that at first I wasn't particularly happy about the dominance of the left wing of the KMT in the country and that the right wing was completely wiped out by Dai Chunfeng, but in recent years I have become a man capable of compromising! Our country is different today than it was in 1925, today we stand together with a united and upright spirit! Let's build a better China together! I hereby announce the first free elections for the Legislative Yuan! My allegiance was to the Republic, to democracy! Thank you!'"

The majority of our enemies were caught by the police and secret service when they were preparing to flee China. Most of them complied with their fate, but there were also some who preferred to commit suicide rather than to be captured. \n\nThe most prominent among them is the former Chairman Wang Jingwei: \nWhen the ZhongTeJu Officers entered Wang's office in his home to arrest him, a terrible picture emerged: \n\nWang Jingwei was crying at his desk, holding a pistol in his hand, on the floor the bodies of his wife and children, all with a bullet wound in their heads.\n\nWhen he saw the officers, he said to them: \n'You bastards will never be able to harm me or my family, I have protected them from the cruel torment that will await us in captivity! I refuse to take part in Dai's sick game somehow making political capital out of us!' \n\nAfter these words, he pointed the gun at his head and pulled the trigger. \n\nThen there was silence. \n\nThe officers were speechless and at first didn't know what to do, but then they decided to take the bodies to their bedrooms and burn the house and put the guilt for the Wang family's death on the fire."

You must read this report immediately! Something terrible is going on in our prisons!' \n\nChiang carefully read the report, which said that the ZhongTeJu is no longer just executing political prisoners, but is now mass murdering their families! \nYesterday, Chen Jiongming and other leaders of the federalists were first executed, then their families were murdered! \nThis text apparently only found its way onto his table because the ZhongTeJu requested trucks from the NRA to remove the bodies and one of the drivers had a conscience and informed the military secret service that they were carrying enormous amounts of bodies of women and children out of the prisons . \nChiang was disgusted and shocked by what he had just read and turned to his adjutant: \n\n'Lieutenant, arrange a meeting with Chairman Dai immediately! I need to find out if he knows that his ZhongTeJu is massacring these innocent people in prisons!' \n\n'Yes! I will arrange it immediately, sir!'"

And not just the prisoners, but also their families! How can you explain that to me? Do you know of this cruel hideousness?' \n\nDai's face instantly darkened from a friendly smile to an angry face. \n\nDai: 'This is not something that is relevant to you in any way, is that clear? You ask if I know about it? I ordered it myself! How else can I stabilize China and secure our power if my enemies and their dirty clans are allowed to run around alive? If I don't remove the entire root, weeds will sprout again in the same place! This is the only way we can ensure prosperity and progress!' \n\nChiang: 'Have you gone completely insane? Punishing our enemies with the full rigor of the law is one thing, but we can't just murder innocent women and children because you believe your interests are at risk! We...' \n\nDai: 'YOU DARE TO TALK TO ME THIS WAY! Never forget that it was me who found you there in that dirty field and it was me who helped you get your memories back! And now you dare to stab me in the back? Remember where your place is and immediately forget everything you just told me!' \n\nChiang: 'I'm sorry, but I cannot overlook the fact that you obviously have no interest in doing good for China with your position, you are only interested in your personal power expansion! And in order to achieve your goal you even walk over the bodies of innocent women and children! I will never forget what you did for me, but this is going way too far!'"

I'm almost proud of you, that's exactly what I would have done in your situation! I would say we are currently in a stalemate.' \n\nChiang: 'I would say that too' \n\nDai: 'I'm sorry, but I still have other important appointments today, I think we need to clarify that later, so we won't be able to resolve our dispute now. I wish you a few nice last days. Goodbye.' \n\nAt that moment, both Chiang and Dai slowly walked out of the room with their guards and closed the doors to Dai's office."

### Flavour Events ###

### NRTA Events ###

chi_tot_flavour.1.t:0 "Foundation of the National Revolutionary Teachers' Association"
chi_tot_flavour.1.d:0 "Our efforts to make the New Life movement a success are finally bearing fruit: \n\nThis morning we received a telegram from the newly founded central committee of the so-called 'National Revolutionary Teachers' Association' (NRTA). They congratulate us on our righteous efforts to make China a modern state that can compete with the West, and they would be happy to help us. In their message, they suggest that we make them the official umbrella organization of all teachers in China under their chairman, a simple teacher from Hunan Province called Mao Zedong. \n\nIn return, they promise us that all teachers at all schools across the country will fully represent our ideals and pass them on to the next generation so that our children can fully understand Sun Yat-sen's ideas and become better people and successful adults."
chi_tot_flavour.1.a:0 "An excellent suggestion! Invite Mao to a meeting so we can discuss that!"
chi_tot_flavour.1.b:0 "What a nonsense! What credible references can this 'Chairman Mao' show us?"

chi_tot_flavour.2.t:0 "Foundation of the National Revolutionary Boy Scouts"
chi_tot_flavour.2.d:0 "Just a few months after the founding of the NRTA, its efforts are already having a positive effect on our education system, now Chairman Mao approached our government with another proposal: The founding of National Revolutionary Boy Scouts (NRBS), modeled on the United States' Boy Scouts but with Chinese characteristics. \n\nWith the help of the NRBS, our students will be taught many useful manual skills and the value of teamwork and friendship so that they can learn how to behave as a loyal and responsible citizen of the Republic of China. \n\nThis proposal is very similar to an idea that has been under discussion within our government for a while now, but it could be even more effective than ours through close cooperation with the NRTA leadership."
chi_tot_flavour.2.a:0 "That is a very good idea! Let's contact the NRTA!"
chi_tot_flavour.2.b:0 "Mao should rather concentrate on his lessons!"

chi_tot_flavour.3.t:0 "Foundation of the National Revolutionary Youth Summer Camps"
chi_tot_flavour.3.d:0 "Chairman Mao and the NRTA presented our government with another great idea that we could use to better support our students. \n\nThey proposed the establishment of National Revolutionary Youth Summer Camps, where our students can spend their holidays meaningfully by playing sports together, singing patriotic songs, learning useful skills for life, or strengthening group cohesion. \n\nAccording to the NRTA, this would not only benefit our students, but ensure that the state later has capable, useful adults who conscientiously live their lives and enjoy their work. \n\nBut now we have to ask ourselves whether we want to continue to provide money for the NRTA projects. Their efforts in all honor, but we cannot deny that their influence is growing faster and faster ..."
chi_tot_flavour.3.a:0 "Another great idea from Chairman Mao! Give him green light!"
chi_tot_flavour.3.b:0 "Mao has already received more than enough attention! Tell him we're not interested!"

chi_tot_flavour.4.t:0 "The Great Education Leap Forward"
chi_tot_flavour.4.d:0 "After all previous projects that were planned and implemented by the NRTA were each a complete success, the government decided to commission them with the complete revision of our current education system. \n\nAfter a few weeks, the final plan was presented to us personally by Chairman Mao: \nIt provides that we should implement ideas already developed in our country by our teachers, but also adapt the best of the best of the education systems in western countries and Japan to ensure that the reform can be a complete success. Mao gave the plan the name: "The Great Education Leap Forward". \n\nMao also said that in order to implement all of this, the NRTA needs the full cooperation of the Ministry of Education, as well as an expansion of its powers. Many in our government support the NRTA's plan, but there are also voices warning that the NRTA, and especially Mao, shouldn't be given more influence in our government because the many projects are already consuming enormous amounts of money. Therefore, they suggest that we should replace Mao with someone less ambitious as the chairman of the NRTA and that we have to significantly reduce the high expenses."
chi_tot_flavour.4.a:0 "Extend the powers of the NRTA. Chairman Mao can implement his new project!"
chi_tot_flavour.4.b:0 "Pat him on the shoulder, but replace him with someone less ambitious as soon as possible."

chi_tot_flavour.5.t:0 "Appointment of the new minister of education"
chi_tot_flavour.5.d:0 "After the success of the NRTA and Chairman Mao in improving and modernizing our education system became more and more noticeable in the country, Generalissimo Chiang decided to restructure his cabinet and to appoint Chairman Mao as the new Minister of Education. \n\nIn his speech, Chiang stated that Mao was a true Chinese patriot who, through his hard work, made China's education system competitive with those of the West and Japan in just a few years. And he says it fills him with pride and trust to see that he even works on holidays to improve the educational standard of the people. And projects that would have taken dozens of years before can now be carried out in just a few years under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao."
chi_tot_flavour.5.a:0 "He even works on holidays! Cheers to Education Minister Mao!"

### Chiang Family Events ^_^ ###

chi_tot_flavour.6.t:0 "A normal day?"
chi_tot_flavour.6.d:0 "Chiang was sitting in his new office thinking about what had happened in the past few weeks. \nIt was only a short time since Dai Chunfeng was overthrown, and yet Chiang felt that he still didn't know the complete truth about his past and could not remember everything yet. \nBut these worries should soon be a thing of the past. \nOn the same day, he was visited by two men in his office who, as it turned out after a long conversation, were his two sons. He was angry that Dai had kept it secret all the time, that he still had a family, and had even actively prevented him from ever remembering it. \nAfter talking for more hours, Chiang decided that they should continue meeting in the coming weeks to help him remember everything that had happened in the past."
chi_tot_flavour.6.a:0 "I'm pleased that the Generalissimo is reunited with his family!"

chi_tot_flavour.7.t:0 "A reunited family"
chi_tot_flavour.7.d:0 "After their first meeting, the three Chiangs met more than fifteen times within the last month and talked to each other for hours. \nDuring this time, Kai-shek, with the help of his two sons, managed to remember what really happened before 1925. \nHe slowly realized that Dai Chunfeng had only helped him remember certain things in recent years, to use his military capabilities to help him destroy his political opponents. \nHe felt dirty, he had thought that Dai was his friend, but he actually only used him out of pure self-interest to come to power and make China his personal playground. \nHe apologized to his sons for not believing them from the start. To make up for it, he asked the two of them if they could help him rebuild China and free it from Dais dark shadow. \nThe two agreed to continue supporting their father. Together they will create a better country for the people."
chi_tot_flavour.7.a:0 "Together as a family we will succeed!"

### Baihua Qifang Events ###

chi_tot_flavour.8.t:0 "Report on the Hundred Flowers Movement"
chi_tot_flavour.8.d:0 "Today, the organizers of the Hundred Flowers movement presented us with an interim report on the progress of the movement. \n\nTo date, over 355,842 citizens have sent a letter to the government with criticism or suggestions for improvement. The organizers are confident that there will be many more letters because 'surprisingly' the citizens have a lot to tell us, which they think is going wrong in the country. \n\nChairman Dai has announced that he is 'very satisfied and extremely happy' with the active participation of so many 'valuable citizens' and also hopes that many more people will turn to him with their thoughts in confidence!"
chi_tot_flavour.8.a:0 "The Movement will definitely improve China!"

chi_tot_flavour.9.t:0 "The Truth About The Hundred Flowers Movement"
chi_tot_flavour.9.d:0 "Today the organizers presented us with the final report of the Hundred Flowers movement: \nOver a period of six months, a total of 1,162,589 citizens sent us a letter with criticism or suggestions for improvement. Among them were intellectuals, simple farmers and fishermen, factory workers and of course also politicians who had hoped to gain prominence and influence again. \n\nThey will all notice that they were fatally wrong. \n\nShortly after the report was evaluated, people across the country who insulted us with their unjustified, outrageous criticism were either shot immediately by the ZhongTeJu, the national Police, or extradited to lynch mobs to amuse our loyal followers, who then brutally murdered these traitors . \n\nThe streets of the country are colored deep red by the huge amount of blood that was shed today, but now even the last traitors in our country should finally understand that we will not stop until they are all dead. All in all, one can say that the movement was a complete success for our side, we managed to lure our enemies out of the reserve by clever action in order to destroy them. \n\nNow China is finally free from selfishness and betrayal by dissatisfied people. Everyone in the country now serves only one purpose, the one goal of making China the greatest nation in the world, and above all serving President Dai, our great Supreme Leader!"
chi_tot_flavour.9.a:0 "Long live Supreme Leader Dai!"

### Chiang Election Events ###

chi_tot_election.1.t:0 "[?global.year] Election of the Legislative Yuan"
chi_tot_election.1.d:0 "In the first free election of the Legislative Yuan after Generalissimo Chiang's counter-coup, only two factions of the KMT have emerged as favorites for a majority. \n\nFirstly, the §CMinzu Faction§! with its leader Li Liejun, who survived Dai Chunfeng's terror. The Minzu Faction of the KMT advocates democratization, but is against allowing other parties besides the KMT in the near future and hehemently refuses to support the Syndicalist Party or the European Syndicalists. In this election, however, they also support Chiang Kai-shek as the top candidate for the office of chairman of the KMT. \n\nThen there is the §OCentral Club Clique§!, an alliance of supporters of the former right-wing KMT, as well as close friends and loyal supporters of Generalissimo Chiang, most notably the brothers Chen Lifu and Chen Goufu, who lead the Clique alongside Chiang. \n\nThe other factions, §TMinquan§! and §RMinsheng§!, are still in a leadership crisis after the tragic deaths of Song Qingling and Wang Jingwei and therefore have no significant chances of winning a majority in this election. \n\nNow everyone was eagerly waiting for all the votes to be counted and the winner is:"
chi_tot_election.1.a:0 "The Minzu Faction wins the most votes and chooses Chiang Kai-shek as chairman!"
chi_tot_election.1.b:0 "The CC-Clique wins the most votes and chooses Chiang Kai-shek as chairman!"

chi_tot_election.2.t:0 "[?global.year] Election of the Legislative Yuan"
chi_tot_election.2.d:0 "Four years ago, after only the Minzu Faction and the CC-Clique were able to stand in the elections, the other two KMT-Factions have since been able to end their leadership crisis and continue to develop a new program for themselves. \n\nIn the Minquan Faction, Fang Junying prevailed against her competitors and is now leading the Faction into the upcoming elections. Fang Junying has shaped the faction in recent years along the lines of Song Qinlingss ideas and has advocated that the KMT should allow more parties in the future and work more closely with the Chinese Syndicalist Party and the Syndicalists in the rest of the world. \n\nIn contrast, Wang Jingweis longtime follower, Chen Gongbo, has asserted himself in the Minsheng Faction and is now leading it. He reaffirmed the KMT's claim to leadership across China and considers it dangerous to allow other parties, and supports continued tutelage of the people. He also advocates that China itself should take an active leadership role in the world instead of becoming a lap dog of the Europeans. \n\nThe Minzu Faction has announced that they want to run this election with their leader Li Liejun as their own candidate because they disagreed with some of Chiang's decisions in the past legislative period and therefore rule out further cooperation with him. \n\nAnd, as expected, the CC-Clique has announced that it will run again with Chiang Kai-shek as their top candidate after 'the Minzu Faction has foolishly insulted him and the other two factions cannot be expected to do any decent government work,' as Chen Lifu said. \n\nNow everyone was eagerly waiting for all the votes to be counted and the winner is:"
