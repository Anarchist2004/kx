### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_SENGIER_DESC:0 "Few men are responsible for or control as much wealth in Africa as Edgar Sengier. Born in 1870, Sengier trained to become an engineer at the University of Leuven in his native Flanders before moving to the Congo to begin work at the Union Miniére in 1911, just as the UMHK was beginning to expand into new markets and different directions. Heading the UMHK’s expansion at this opportune time, Sengier first aided the Union Miniére by helping build up its domestic copper industry. By applying his technical expertise in the construction of new mines and refineries in Katanga, Sengier made a name for himself as a shrewd foreman and sound logician, planting the seeds for his rise through the UMHK’s hierarchy. In the years since, Sengier has taken the Union Miniére du Haut Katanga to new heights, particularly taking a keen interest in expanding the uranium mines of the Congo due to a tip from his colleague Sir Henry Tizard, and the massive mining monopoly now stands as the largest company in all of Congo. Sengier’s ambitions knows no bounds as he endeavors to make the UMHK, and by extension himself, the richest single entity in Africa."
POLITICS_MAD_MIKE_DESC:0 "An Irish boy far from his ancestral home, born in the distant city of Calcutta in 1919 - 6 years before the fall of the British Empire to fiery revolution - Thomas Michael Hoare is an odd sight to see in Katanga, and yet here he rules over a growing band of mercenaries like a modern warrior-king. \n\nThe son of a river pilot and military veteran, Hoare’s family fled Calcutta when he was a boy as the city burned in the death throes of British Imperialism, and fled to his father’s old home in South Africa. \n\nWhile in his new home, Hoare attended regular schooling in Pretoria before growing bored and impatient with the lack of action. To remedy this boredom and burning hatred built up since his family’s forced migration, Hoare took up an early tour with the South African Union Defense Force by lying about his age, where he received a baptism by fire while still just a teenager against Zulu rebels and border conflicts with the Germans. After becoming entranced by the beauty and glory of war at a young age and after witnessing his family be uprooted and run out of India by Socialist revolutionaries, Hoare has developed into a violent, ravenous, and deadly young soldier with an abhorrent disdain for Socialism and rebellion. Leading a group of other like-minded young officers, soldiers, bandits, and other vagabonds called Commando 5, or as Hoare calls them his ‘Wild Geese,’ Thomas Michael Hoare has begun to make a name for himself, and now the world shall watch as this ‘Mad’ Mike builds his own fiefdom in the heart of Africa."
POLITICS_TSHOMBE_KATANGA_DESC:0 "Moïse Kapend Tshombe would probably sell out his own mother if it meant it would complete his dream of a free Katanga, but luckily that may not be necessary, for it seems that Tshombe has achieved this dream himself. After seceding from the Kivu Clique and their bastardized attempt at a republic, Tshombe now reigns as the President of the State of Katanga - a newly independent state held up by a loose alliance of colonial investors from the UMHK, mercenary brigades, Mwami loyalists, and CONAKAT politicians and tribal leaders. Under its new President, Katanga is expected to be further exploited for the sweet allure of profit, for no man in Africa loves money like President Tshombe. Now, this Golden God of Katanga must dance a fine line between his web of alliances lest the wolves that circle his position so ravenously find their moment to strike."
POLITICS_MUNONGO_DESC:0 "Once Moïse Tshombe’s main ally in CONAKAT, Godefroid Munongo has surpassed his old friend to be the new leader of Katanga through dubious means. Tshombe’s true fate matters not now, for Munongo is the new President, and has great plans for his new domain. As a descendent of the Msiri - the original founder of Garanganze and the first of the Mwami - Munongo has begun to fashion himself as an alternative to the aging Mwami of Katanga, though he still bends the knee for appearances to ensure the Mwami’s loyalists still support him. Munongo plans to further the purification of Katanga and seeks to amplify the current campaign against the Kasaians while slowly distancing himself from the mercenaries and colonials in his employ. What is in store for the evermore chaotic Katanga is not sure, but with the young, inexperienced, and brash Munongo at the helm, many fear that Katanga is fated to be in turmoil forever."

### Focuses ###

UMN_the_union_minere:0 "The Union Minière"
UMN_the_union_minere_desc:0 "The Union Minière du Haut-Katanga, or as its more commonly called the Union Minière or UMHK, is a massive mining concern founded as a joint venture by Flandro-Wallonian and Anglo industrial, rail, and mining concerns already operating in the region in 1906. Since then, German interests have increasingly replaced the Anglos as the dominant partner to the Flandro-Wallonian operators, and as such, Germany has been able to benefit from the rich mineral wealth the UMHK extracts from the Earth. With the collapse of Mittelafrika and the Congo Vrijstaat, the UMHK has found itself adrift without the support of Europe for the first time since its foundation, and now they stand as the dominant force of power in Katanga. They must resist the swirling chaos that now engulfs them as it consumes the Congo, even as whispers of an old foe’s return circulate these jungles."

UMN_declare_independence:0 "A Formal Declaration of Independence"
UMN_declare_independence_desc:0 "We have been cast adrift onto this sea of chaos that has replaced and consumed the once pristine and placid region of Congo. To consolidate our rule as we find our company tossed into the role of a provisional government, we must issue a formal declaration of independence from the Congo colony. Under the leadership of Chief Director Edgar Sengier and the Union Minière board of directors, a new sovereign corporate state shall rise in Katanga. For good health, good spirits, and high productivity!"

UMN_fate_of_the_north:0 "Fate of the Congo"
UMN_fate_of_the_north_desc:0 "To the North of our capitalist haven, the rest of the Congo is embroiled in fierce war as mercenaries and natives rise against the colonialist machine. We must decide here and now what our policy towards these collapse-states shall be. Whether we soldier on to take these resource-rich lands for ourselves or choose to enjoy our splendid isolation here in Katanga, the UMHK will find profit wherever we go."

UMN_unify_congo:0 "From Katanga to All of Congo"
UMN_unify_congo_desc:0 "The vast colonial apparatus that once ruled over this region we call Congo had long squandered the unimaginable material wealth hidden within the jungles and bedrock of this primordial Eden. Only we, the newly christened ‘Union Minière du Grand Congo’ can truly appreciate and exploit the natural bounty that is this Dark Heart of Africa."

UMN_the_force_publique:0 "Join with the Force Publique"
UMN_the_force_publique_desc:0 "The Force Publique has long served as the final line of defense between Congo and absolute chaos. Their oppressive but effective tactics are infamous throughout the colony, and despite their aging equipment and dwindling White officer corp, the native in their employ make up for it with their savagery and tenacity. We must align with this last sword and shield of colonial rule in Congo, lest we face the wolves alone."

UMN_support_the_government:0 "Recognize the Vrijstaat"
UMN_support_the_government_desc:0 "The Vrijstaat, or Free State, is the rightful Congolese government, and as such, our natural allies. Long has the Union Minière served the Ryckmans Regime, and this cooperation shall continue. Our company makes up over two-thirds of the Congo’s economy. They simply can not survive without us, and we both know it."

UMN_rejoin_the_freestate:0 "Question of Unification"
UMN_rejoin_the_freestate_desc:0 "Though our territorial extent is small, we are the bigger player in these coming negotiations. As the richest entity in Congo, the Ryckmans Regime will simply not survive without the capital and resources that flow from our mines. We will approach them about unification, but if they choose to accept, we will hold their nation and all future ambitions of Congo by the balls."

UMN_secure_the_mines:0 "Secure Our Mines"
UMN_secure_the_mines_desc:0 "From the expansive Ruashi Copper Mine to the massive uranium and radon pits of Shinkolobwe, the mines and mineral extraction depots that stretch across our company’s domain are the backbone of our economy and our power. We must ensure that the mines are secured and protected from rebel tampering, for without these ore pits, the UMHK is nothing."

UMN_merc_strikebreakers:0 "Mercenary Strikebreakers"
UMN_merc_strikebreakers_desc:0 "Most of our industrial workforce consists of few and far between White formen and managers overseeing swaths of native laborers and workers. With the collapse of all sense of stability as Mittelafrika imploded, these natives, despite our seemingly ample pro-worker’s legislation, have risen up against our commands and have started to strike for better conditions and a greater say in the company. Luckily, the Congo is crawling with many mercenaries who will eagerly labour away or crack the heads of strikers, as long as they are paid - and if there is one thing we have no shortage of, its money."

UMN_our_buisness_is_buisness:0 "Our Business is Business"
UMN_our_buisness_is_buisness_desc:0 "Our business is business - the Union Minière is the richest company in Congo and one of the most profitable ventures in all of Africa. No organization, European or African, knows how to profit off the backs of natives in this bountiful paradise like we do, and none shall while we are around. No matter our positions or situation, the money must always flow."

UMN_the_mines_keep_running:0 "The Mines that Never Sleep"
UMN_the_mines_keep_running_desc:0 "Every minute of every day, the ground rumbles and the sky further blackens as our mining operations continue ever forward. At night, our forges and lanterns light up the night sky as our miners and foundrymen toil hard and ceaselessly; their burden never ending. Tin, cobalt, copper, uranium, cadmium, silver, gold, manganese, and so much more are ripped from the earth without end, for our mines never sleep, and neither do our workers."

UMN_belgian_ancapistan:0 "A Congo Rolling in Cash"
UMN_belgian_ancapistan_desc:0 "We have taken control over the vast expanse of what once was the Congo Vrijstaat, and now it is up to us to administer this massive, bountiful region. The Union Minière du Grand Congo has risen, and all of the Congo will be made into our financial playground as the UMGC moves to tap into every possible avenue for profit available to us. The cash will flow and Chief Director Sengier and the rest of the company shall be rolling in more capital than they know what to do with. All turns to gold in the Congo."

UMN_exploiting_the_congo:0 "Exploiting Eden"
UMN_exploiting_the_congo_desc:0 "The Congo Rainforest and the surrounding wilds are some of the most beautiful, wondrous, and diverse natural ecosystems in the known world. Not only does this region hold more biodiversity in both flora and fauna than anywhere else on Earth save maybe the Amazon, but this living paradise also holds under its soil and within its thickets a treasure trove of profitable riches unlike the world has ever seen. It is the Union Minière’s destiny to be the ones to break open this treasure once and for all, and so we will sweep across every square mile of this Garden of Eden, reaping profit with every ore vein broken into and every hardwood tree cut down."

UMN_ties_with_home:0 "A Journey Home to Brussels"
UMN_ties_with_home_desc:0 "Now that we have established ourselves as the rightful government of the former territory of the Congo Vrijstaat, we should make overtures with the nation that birthed our very existence. Without their recognition and aid, establishing ourselves on the international market will be much more difficult, as currently many nations see us as a rogue corporate state. To Brussels, we go!"

UMN_work_harder:0 "Good Health..."
UMN_work_harder_desc:0 "We must ensure we have a steadily supplied and amble workforce in order to fulfill the quotas we have put in place to maintain the demand we have sparked due to our successful financial endeavors. We profess good health, and we mean it - the health of our profit margins that is! Work our forgers and smiths hard and the miners harder, and rotate them on shifts so work carries on non-stop indefinitely. The forges must never grow cold and the minecarts must never arrive from the depths empty, so we must work, work, work!"

UMN_uranium_diplomacy:0 "Uranium Diplomacy"
UMN_uranium_diplomacy_desc:0 "With our access to Shinkolobwe, we control one of the greatest deposits of nuclear material on Earth in the form of massive uranium and radium mines. Using the precious, yet dangerously radioactive, cargo sourced from this mine, we shall leverage our way into the arms of one of the great powers. This shall secure our newfound independence and garner us new allies and trade partners, all in exchange for a few tons of ore."

UMN_control_the_miners:0 "Good Spirits..."
UMN_control_the_miners_desc:0 "Worker moral is a fickle thing, but a happy, or motivated, worker is a productive worker. We are one of the wealthiest conglomerates on this planet, so we can afford to toss our thousands of labourers devent benefits to quell their natural tendency to complain, strike, and rebel. There is always Plan B if these incentives and benefits fail to sufficiently inspire our workforce to toil, for the Force Publique is always only a call away..."

UMN_rolling_in_cash:0 "...and High Productivity"
UMN_rolling_in_cash_desc:0 "At the end of the day, the bottom line is the most important aspect of our operation. Everything we do, everything we have done, and everything we shall continue to do has been in the endless pursuit of profit. We are the largest company in all of Africa, and one of the largest in Humanity’s history. Like the A.O.G or the East Indian Trading Company of old, we have bent a continent to our own whims as we endeavor to ever higher levels of success and fortune, for it is the destiny of the Union Minière du Grand Congo to become the richest nation in history!"

UMN_lighter_hand:0 "A Lighter Hand"
UMN_lighter_hand_desc:0 "If we are to keep control over Katanga and the swathe of natives we now lord over, we are going to need to think about long-term cooperation. We will not be able to sustain our precarious position of power by oppressing the Africans, so we must take a lighter approach if we hope to keep the profits coming. Non-Socialist unions shall be allowed to organize, fairer hours and safer work conditions shall be ensured, pay will be increased, and more to show the native Katangans we are here to stay and that we are serious about administering these lands."

UMN_congolese_industraial_revolution:0 "The Congolese Industrial Revolution"
UMN_congolese_industraial_revolution_desc:0 "To hell with the whims and needs of the natives! What the UMHK needs is of the utmost importance, above all. We do not need to take a softer approach, but instead we must double down on our profit-seeking mission. Katanga must be transformed into a state where profit matters above all, and to fuel this drive, a new industrial revolution here in the southern expanse of the Congo shall be jump started. Sure, factory conditions, working conditions, and the overall condition of the environment shall all suffer, but they are all necessary to achieve maximum profit."

UMN_minor_labour_regulations:0 "Minor Pragmatic Labour Regulations"
UMN_minor_labour_regulations_desc:0 "We must be pragmatic in our legislation lest the natives who compose most of our workforce shall overthrow our Board without second thought. More minor regulations shall be passed to appease these labourers while a new pragmatic attitude towards our native policy shall be fully adopted. Though not every choice made and agreement reached will please both parties fully, we must at least maintain a balance between profit and employee satisfaction, lest this whole capitalist experiment collapse."

UMN_allow_blacks_positions:0 "Give Prominent Natives Token Positions"
UMN_allow_blacks_positions_desc:0 "To alleviate tensions with the native Congolese peoples, we must grant token positions within our administration to prominent Africans within our borders. Figures such as Moïse Tshombe and Godefroid Munongo, among many others, shall be given seats on the UMHK’s Board of Directors while lesser figures are allotted to far less important roles, sprinkling enough diversity hires around enough to appease the masses as we feign cooperation."

UMN_hire_administrators:0 "Hire New Administrators and Soldiers"
UMN_hire_administrators_desc:0 "As we expand our administration and operations, we will need more blood to fill the ranks of our growing bureaucracy. Former colonial figures, prominent tycoons and business moguls, soldiers, and even mercenaries shall all be hired from across the wider Congo and Mittelafrika, beckoning any and all seeking fortune and freedom to come to our borders. Though we will likely be forced to take in many candidates far less than qualified, it must be done to fill-out this infantile administration. "

UMN_corporate_administrative_bureaucracy:0 "Corporate Administrative Bureaucracy"
UMN_corporate_administrative_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The governmental apparatus of our capitalism-fueled state is entirely built around the UMHK. This monopolistic leviathan controls all aspects of Katanga’s government, economy, and entire socioeconomic system. The company is the final say, the only say, in all matters and everything flows back to the Board of Directors one way or another. Their eyes are everywhere and their lackeys every patrol as the skies of Katanga and beyond turn black with the smoke of Capitalism’s dominance and progress. Life and civilization itself in Katanga is owned by the UMHK, and nothing can stop their pursuit of profit now as the corporate bureaucracy continues to grow."

Doing this out of no patriotic spirit, for Tshombe only loves the pursuit of profit and his allied tribesmen within CONAKAT, the future of this infantile state now lies in his hands, but even now his rivals circle like wolves, waiting for their moment to strike. Tshombe must dance a fine line between the various cliques that support his rule, lest his new regime crumble to madmen and mercenaries."

None know this truth more than President Tshombe, who has seemingly built an entire independent state just to pursue this siren’s call in peace, without interruption and interference from outside parties who may not be so understanding of Tshombe's plight and ambition. Now, in the jungles of Katanga, Tshombe shall seek to build his own enterprise, securing his people’s independence and his own fortune."

To combat these lesser leeches and cease their drain upon our new state, Tshombe and Munongo had long ago concocted a plan to deal with these parasites.

unionminere.1.d:0 "No company or other single entity within Congo is more economically dominant than the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga. Formed in 1906 as a joint venture of the Flandro-Wallonian Compagnie du Katanga and Comite Special du Katanga with the Anglo company Tanganyika Concessions LTD., the UMHK has grown over the decades to become dominant like none other. Controlling mines, refineries, factories, processing and shipping centers, their own rail infrastructure, and so much more, this monopoly of monopolies rivals the East India Company in its influence and power. Having a controlling interest in roughly 70% of the Congo’s total economy, it is safe to say that this miner’s union effectively controls the financial sector of the Congo. \n\nWith the collapse of the Vrijstaat, the Lead Director of the Union Minière, [UMN.getleader], the UMHK has had to quickly establish a makeshift governmental structure as it has become responsible over swathes of Katanga. This company-turned-state must now establish itself in this rising tide of chaos and destruction, for the wolves circle it at every moment. To the North, mercenaries and native Askari have risen up to fight for their right of sovereignty, and within our own borders, whispers have spread of the Mwami’s return. We must remain vigilant as we build up our new corporate state, for even all the money in the world can not save us if we fail now."

unionminere.2.t:0 "Our Benefactors in Katanga Make an Offer"
unionminere.2.d:0 "The capitalist-dominated provisional government in Haut-Katanga under Director Edgar Sengier has petitioned our government to join their growing coalition of colonialist holdouts. If we accepted, we would be forced under the rule of the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga and Sengier, throwing away our sovereignty for mere autonomy under their control. Alternatively, we could just deny this ludicrous request, but as a result we may have to face the wrath of the UMHK on the open battlefield. How shall we respond?"

unionminere.6.t:0 "A New Wave of Worker Unrest"
unionminere.6.d:0 "As the atmosphere of instability continues to grow within Katanga due to the violent and chaotic civil war, tensions within our struggling corporate state have risen near the breaking point. Miners and refinery workers across the plots and properties held by the UMHK have risen up in strike and protest, demanding better pay, safer working conditions, and shorter shifts along with other minor social welfare, for they have realized that they are the lifeblood of our company and our power. Worse still, due to our recently ‘earned’ independence, our workforce has been greatly limited, increasing the damage these rapidly spreading strikes have done to our economy and political influence. Without the money flowing and the gears of industry spinning, greased with the promise of profit and opportunity, our hold over Katanga will quickly crumble. We are a literal corporate state, and without a functioning and profitable corporation, our regime is not only doomed to fail but is virtually non-existent. These riots and strikes will need to be dealt with soon lest we desire for our feeble hold over this expanse to collapse, especially with the rumors of old foes regaining their strength in the dense jungles that surround and isolate us."

With this crisis not having reached such a critical stage, many within the UMHK’s administration had called for drastic and harsh action to be taken to deal with the riots. These scared tycoons and captains of industry seek to pay off as many mercenaries as possible to function as emergency strike breakers while using refugees from the civil war as underpaid strike scabs. This sweeping plan would hopefully crush the spirits of these protestors as we move to consolidate our rule. \n\nHowever, many on the Board of Directors feel that this plan is far too drastic, likely to cause more problems than it would solve and only further angering the native Africans. These more level-headed administrators believe that only through negotiation with these strikers can there be any hope of peace, and Edgar Sengier has expressed his sympathy with this more moderate group behind closed doors. Whatever our Board’s final decision is, we must make it delicately, for Katanga inches closer to collapse by the day."

unionminere.8.d:0 "With our decision to crack down harshly on the African workers striking against our regime, old foes have begun to rise from the primordial expanses of Katanga and beyond. From within the jungles and disconnected villages that remain untouched by our monopoly has once again risen the Mwami, heir to the Yeke Kingdom and ‘rightful’ ruler of Katanga. Patriarch of the Bayeke, or Garanganze, people and noble descendent of the Msiri, Mwami Kitanika and his loyal forces wage a guerilla war against our regime as they did against Ryckmans before us. Though his forces are dwindling due to his failed war against the Vrijstaat, he has still proven to be a thorn in our side, and some believe he is to blame for the recent rise in protests and strikes. Though this claim is dubious, with the protest more likely forming as a response to both our new rule in the wake of the civil war and our abhorrent managerial practices, this has not stopped the Mwami from becoming a scapegoat for our issues. With our situation growing more dire by the minute and with our resources already stretched so thin, our regime must make a choice. Should we waste precious weapons, supplies, and manpower, all resources we have little to spare, to deal with this minor tribalist threat to show the nation that something is being done to deal with the unrest, or shall we simply let this mad king rave as we deal with the larger issues at hand."

unionminere.9.d:0 "We have been foolish, too busy pursuing profit and dealing with the strikers, too long ignoring the rising tribalist threat, and now it may be too late to save our precious capitalist experiment. Even now, the forces of Mwami Kitanika Mabumba Mushalila and his brother Munongo march against us, and across Katanga more and more of our outlying mines and outposts go dark, failing to hail back to us on any frequency. These centers of our influence have slipped away without so much as a word of notice, and with each that falls, our hold over Katanga grows ever weaker. \n\nIn a final showdown outside the UMHK’s main compound in Elisabethville, the soul of Katanga is on the line as a large force of Mwami loyalists, all fervent supporters of the House of Msiri."
unionminere.9.a:0 "All that is needed is a bit of lead paid in gold; send in the mercs."

Mwami Kitanika Mabumba Mushalila and his brother, heirs to Msiri and champions of the people of Garanganze, are the liberators of Katanga, and now shall oversee the recreation of their ancestral kingdom. Pushing for a return to tradition, expanding resource extraction, consolidation of power under the Mwami’s kingdom, and slight reforms to model this resurgent monarchy after the enlightened Chrstian monarchies of Europe, the Mwami and his loyal forces shall finally free Katanga from the vices of colonialism and drag these primordial lands into the future, without losing sight of their tradition and tribalist roots."

unionminere.11.t:0 "Our Greatest Diplomatic Asset"
unionminere.11.d:0 "Of all the resource extraction sites, miners, and refineries within the Congo under the control of the UMHK, none is more important than Shinkolobwe. Also known as Kasolo or Chinkolobew, this massive mine at the heart of the Kambove mining region in Katanga is one of the largest single deposits of uranium on Earth, providing untold amounts of uranium and radium for us to extract and sell. With recent scientific advances, the potential of such a material is quickly being realized, and every great power on the planet is chomping at the bit for access to any known deposits of the stuff. \n\nThis lucrative nature could prove to be our greatest bargaining chip, as every nation with a hand in international diplomacy seeks to harness the power of this ore for themselves, yet most lack the necessary access to uranium and other elements like it to do it. With this in mind, we shall use our stores of uranium as leverage as we seek to find new allies to protect our newly independent capitalist haven. The most beneficial candidates for us to reach out to are of course Germany and the Entente - both the current and former colonial overlords of Africa. Whoever we reach out to shall be offered the necessary materials to unlock and harness the secrets of the atom, and all they need to do in return is supply our troops and keep our borders safe."
unionminere.11.a:0 "Reach out to the Kaiserreich, for they are the true and proven hegemon."

They have offered full access to their stores of this precious fissile material under the condition that we admit them into our alliance and offer them our protection. While doing so would further entangle us within African affairs, it would also align us with one of the richest and largest companies in Africa - and the only one both functioning as an independent state and with such easy access to one of the most sought-after materials on the planet.

With this hard-earned victory, Tshombe now stands as the sole figure of power in the Congo, at least for a moment, and now has free reign to carve up his prize as he sees fit. \n\nBefore him lay a few possible options for how to deal with the vast swathe of land he has just come intro control of. Tshombe could simply leave the rest of the Congo to their own devices, breaking Katanga off from the larger whole and leaving the fools in Kinshasa to fend for themselves as Tshombe reaps the profits and rewards of his hard work, saving him the headache of ruling over all of Congo. Alternatively, Tshombe could reinstate the Congolese Republic, declaring himself as President of all Congo while likely still heavily favoring his home region. In direct opposition to these ideas, Tshombe could also instead move to balkanzie the Congo entirely, shattering the colonially-forged makeshift borders destroying the idea of a unified Congo completely. If he were to take this more drastic solution, Tshombe could then either decide to merely leave the newly created states to their own devices, or instead corral them under his influence as satellite governments. In the end, the choice is up to the President, and the rest of the Congo waits with bated breath on his decision."

Though this position is largely ceremonial, since most political power shall truly reside in Tshombe’s hands, it is still a required position to maintain legitimacy in the eyes of the people and the wider world while also helping to share the burden of ruling over this wild frontier. \n\nThe main candidates Tshombe has in mind are his main political ally in CONAKAT - Godefroid Munongo, the leader of Commando 5 and the head of Katanga’s mercenary military - ‘Mad’ Mike Hoare, and the current chairman of the UMHK - Edgar Sengier. Each of these candidates are vital to the overall survival of Katanga, but only one can be Vice-President. Who shall Tshombe choose?"

President Tshombe has done much to assuage the concerns of his comrades, ensuring them that Mad Mike and his forces are only ensuring that the money continues to flow, denying any accusations that the young merc wants any power for himself.

Hearing the pilot from the cockpit, it seems the plane collided with a flock of wild African geese, whose heavy frames have collided with the left engine, causing it to fail and causing the plane to slowly drop altitude as it travels thousands of feet above the Atlantic. With time of the essence, the flight crew have begun emergency measures, and now it is up to fate and the crew whether or not they can land this bird and bring our President home safely."

Under Munongo, Katanga is expected to take a darker turn as the new President consolidates his position. The chief architect behind Tshombe’s reprisals against the Kasaian peoples like the Baluba, Munongo is expected to increase the regime’s attacks and harsh policies against this troublesome minority. A relative and self-proclaimed heir to the Mwami’s royal line, Munonogo is also expected to massively increase Katanga’s emphasis on the culture of the old Yeke Kingdom while also moving more closely to the Mwami as he distances himself from Hoare and Sengier."

katanga.8.t:0 "Hoare Takes Over for the Late President"
katanga.8.d:0 "With President Moïse Tshombe now missing and presumed dead, a replacement has quickly been named to maintain stability in our chaotic little state. To make the transition as simple and quick as possible, Tshombe’s Vice President Mike Hoare has been sworn in as acting President until Tshombe, or his body, is found. Though he shall tacitly follow the legacy of Tshombe, many expect this facade of respect to drop quickly after Tshombe’s body is still left to be unfound after a few weeks with Hoare as President."
katanga.8.a:0 "This seems familiar."

katanga.9.t:0 "Sengier Takes Over for the Late President"
katanga.9.d:0 "With President Moïse Tshombe now missing and presumed dead, a replacement has quickly been named to maintain stability in our chaotic little state. To make the transition as simple and quick as possible, Tshombe’s Vice President Edgar Sengier has been sworn in as acting President until Tshombe, or his body, is found. Though he shall tacitly follow the legacy of Tshombe, many expect this facade of respect to drop quickly after Tshombe’s body is still left to be unfound after a few weeks with Sengier as President."
katanga.9.a:0 "Really, this again?"

katanga.10.t:0 "Hoare Seizes the Apparatus of State"
katanga.10.d:0 "With his ascension to acting President, ‘Mad’ Mike Hoare and the men of 5 Commando have worked diligently to consolidate their grip over Katanga. With their agents implanted within every major level of the Katanga hierarchy, Hoare has begun to shed the thin veneer of subservience he once had to Tshombe’s legacy, and now had fully broken off to fulfill his own agenda. ‘Mad’ Mike is expected to further militarize Katanga like never before as he and his Wild Geese move to fully transform the Congo into a wild and free merc state. Under Hoare’s regime, adventure, profit, and the ecstasy of combat shall become paramount pillars of the State of Katanga while Tshombe’s influence is washed away for good. Though the UMHK shall still maintain its level of wealth and prominence within Hoare’s new regime, the other old allies of Tshombe like Munongo and the Mwami loyalists have been ousted from the government for good. Now, the world watches as yet another powergrab takes place in Africa’s darkest heart, throwing Katanga and the wider region into chaos once more."
katanga.10.a:0 "Mad Mike's Control grows evermore."

katanga.11.t:0 "The UMHK Seizes the Apparatus of State once More"
katanga.11.d:0 "With his ascension to acting President, Edgar Sengier and the haughty colonials of the UMHK have worked diligently to consolidate their grip over Katanga. With their agents implanted within every major level of the Katanga hierarchy, Sengier has begun to shed the thin veneer of subservience he once had to Tshombe’s legacy, and now had fully broken off to fulfill his own agenda. The UMHK is expected to further industrialize Katanga like never before as he and his business partners move to fully transform the Congo into the most profitable swathe of colonial frontier in the world. Under Sengier’s regime, rampant capitalism and the unending march towards ever-higher profits shall become paramount pillars of the State of Katanga while Tshombe’s influence is washed away for good. Though the mercs of 5 Commando shall still maintain their level of prominence within our military under Sengier’s new regime, the other old allies of Tshombe like Munongo and the Mwami loyalists have been ousted from the government for good. Now, the world watches as yet another powergrab takes place in Africa’s darkest heart, throwing Katanga and the wider region into chaos once more."
katanga.11.a:0 "Again?"
