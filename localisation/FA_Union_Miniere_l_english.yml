### Focuses ###

UMN_the_union_minere:0 "The Union Minière"
UMN_the_union_minere_desc:0 "The Union Minière du Haut-Katanga, or as its more commonly called the Union Minière or UMHK, is a massive mining concern founded as a joint venture by Flandro-Wallonian and Anglo industrial, rail, and mining concerns already operating in the region in 1906. Since then, German interests have increasingly replaced the Anglos as the dominant partner to the Flandro-Wallonian operators, and as such, Germany has been able to benefit from the rich mineral wealth the UMHK extracts from the Earth. With the collapse of Mittelafrika and the Congo Vrijstaat, the UMHK has found itself adrift without the support of Europe for the first time since its foundation, and now they stand as the dominant force of power in Katanga. They must resist the swirling chaos that now engulfs them as it consumes the Congo, even as whispers of an old foe’s return circulate these jungles."

UMN_declare_independence:0 "A Formal Declaration of Independence"
UMN_declare_independence_desc:0 "We have been cast adrift onto this sea of chaos that has replaced and consumed the once pristine and placid region of Congo. To consolidate our rule as we find our company tossed into the role of a provisional government, we must issue a formal declaration of independence from the Congo colony. Under the leadership of Chief Director Edgar Sengier and the Union Minière board of directors, a new sovereign corporate state shall rise in Katanga. For good health, good spirits, and high productivity!"

UMN_fate_of_the_north:0 "Fate of the Congo"
UMN_fate_of_the_north_desc:0 "To the North of our capitalist haven, the rest of the Congo is embroiled in fierce war as mercenaries and natives rise against the colonialist machine. We must decide here and now what our policy towards these collapse-states shall be. Whether we soldier on to take these resource-rich lands for ourselves or choose to enjoy our splendid isolation here in Katanga, the UMHK will find profit wherever we go."

UMN_unify_congo:0 "From Katanga to All of Congo"
UMN_unify_congo_desc:0 "The vast colonial apparatus that once ruled over this region we call Congo had long squandered the unimaginable material wealth hidden within the jungles and bedrock of this primordial Eden. Only we, the newly christened ‘Union Minière du Grand Congo’ can truly appreciate and exploit the natural bounty that is this Dark Heart of Africa."

UMN_the_force_publique:0 "Join with the Force Publique"
UMN_the_force_publique_desc:0 "The Force Publique has long served as the final line of defense between Congo and absolute chaos. Their oppressive but effective tactics are infamous throughout the colony, and despite their aging equipment and dwindling White officer corp, the native in their employ make up for it with their savagery and tenacity. We must align with this last sword and shield of colonial rule in Congo, lest we face the wolves alone."

UMN_support_the_government:0 "Recognize the Vrijstaat"
UMN_support_the_government_desc:0 "The Vrijstaat, or Free State, is the rightful Congolese government, and as such, our natural allies. Long has the Union Minière served the Ryckmans Regime, and this cooperation shall continue. Our company makes up over two-thirds of the Congo’s economy. They simply can not survive without us, and we both know it."

UMN_rejoin_the_freestate:0 "Question of Unification"
UMN_rejoin_the_freestate_desc:0 "Though our territorial extent is small, we are the bigger player in these coming negotiations. As the richest entity in Congo, the Ryckmans Regime will simply not survive without the capital and resources that flow from our mines. We will approach them about unification, but if they choose to accept, we will hold their nation and all future ambitions of Congo by the balls."

UMN_secure_the_mines:0 "Secure Our Mines"
UMN_secure_the_mines_desc:0 "From the expansive Ruashi Copper Mine to the massive uranium and radon pits of Shinkolobwe, the mines and mineral extraction depots that stretch across our company’s domain are the backbone of our economy and our power. We must ensure that the mines are secured and protected from rebel tampering, for without these ore pits, the UMHK is nothing."

UMN_merc_strikebreakers:0 "Mercenary Strikebreakers"
UMN_merc_strikebreakers_desc:0 "Most of our industrial workforce consists of few and far between White formen and managers overseeing swaths of native laborers and workers. With the collapse of all sense of stability as Mittelafrika imploded, these natives, despite our seemingly ample pro-worker’s legislation, have risen up against our commands and have started to strike for better conditions and a greater say in the company. Luckily, the Congo is crawling with many mercenaries who will eagerly labour away or crack the heads of strikers, as long as they are paid - and if there is one thing we have no shortage of, its money."

UMN_our_buisness_is_buisness:0 "Our Business is Business"
UMN_our_buisness_is_buisness_desc:0 "Our business is business - the Union Minière is the richest company in Congo and one of the most profitable ventures in all of Africa. No organization, European or African, knows how to profit off the backs of natives in this bountiful paradise like we do, and none shall while we are around. No matter our positions or situation, the money must always flow."

UMN_the_mines_keep_running:0 "The Mines that Never Sleep"
UMN_the_mines_keep_running_desc:0 "Every minute of every day, the ground rumbles and the sky further blackens as our mining operations continue ever forward. At night, our forges and lanterns light up the night sky as our miners and foundrymen toil hard and ceaselessly; their burden never ending. Tin, cobalt, copper, uranium, cadmium, silver, gold, manganese, and so much more are ripped from the earth without end, for our mines never sleep, and neither do our workers."

UMN_belgian_ancapistan:0 "A Congo Rolling in Cash"
UMN_belgian_ancapistan_desc:0 "We have taken control over the vast expanse of what once was the Congo Vrijstaat, and now it is up to us to administer this massive, bountiful region. The Union Minière du Grand Congo has risen, and all of the Congo will be made into our financial playground as the UMGC moves to tap into every possible avenue for profit available to us. The cash will flow and Chief Director Sengier and the rest of the company shall be rolling in more capital than they know what to do with. All turns to gold in the Congo."

UMN_exploiting_the_congo:0 "Exploiting Eden"
UMN_exploiting_the_congo_desc:0 "The Congo Rainforest and the surrounding wilds are some of the most beautiful, wondrous, and diverse natural ecosystems in the known world. Not only does this region hold more biodiversity in both flora and fauna than anywhere else on Earth save maybe the Amazon, but this living paradise also holds under its soil and within its thickets a treasure trove of profitable riches unlike the world has ever seen. It is the Union Minière’s destiny to be the ones to break open this treasure once and for all, and so we will sweep across every square mile of this Garden of Eden, reaping profit with every ore vein broken into and every hardwood tree cut down."

UMN_ties_with_home:0 "A Journey Home to Brussels"
UMN_ties_with_home_desc:0 "Now that we have established ourselves as the rightful government of the former territory of the Congo Vrijstaat, we should make overtures with the nation that birthed our very existence. Without their recognition and aid, establishing ourselves on the international market will be much more difficult, as currently many nations see us as a rogue corporate state. To Brussels, we go!"

UMN_work_harder:0 "Good Health..."
UMN_work_harder_desc:0 "We must ensure we have a steadily supplied and amble workforce in order to fulfill the quotas we have put in place to maintain the demand we have sparked due to our successful financial endeavors. We profess good health, and we mean it - the health of our profit margins that is! Work our forgers and smiths hard and the miners harder, and rotate them on shifts so work carries on non-stop indefinitely. The forges must never grow cold and the minecarts must never arrive from the depths empty, so we must work, work, work!"

UMN_control_the_miners:0 "Good Spirits..."
UMN_control_the_miners_desc:0 "Worker moral is a fickle thing, but a happy, or motivated, worker is a productive worker. We are one of the wealthiest conglomerates on this planet, so we can afford to toss our thousands of labourers devent benefits to quell their natural tendency to complain, strike, and rebel. There is always Plan B if these incentives and benefits fail to sufficiently inspire our workforce to toil, for the Force Publique is always only a call away..."

UMN_rolling_in_cash:0 "...and High Productivity"
UMN_rolling_in_cash_desc:0 "At the end of the day, the bottom line is the most important aspect of our operation. Everything we do, everything we have done, and everything we shall continue to do has been in the endless pursuit of profit. We are the largest company in all of Africa, and one of the largest in Humanity’s history. Like the A.O.G or the East Indian Trading Company of old, we have bent a continent to our own whims as we endeavor to ever higher levels of success and fortune, for it is the destiny of the Union Minière du Grand Congo to become the richest nation in history!"
