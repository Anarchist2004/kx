### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_SENGIER_DESC:0 "Few men are responsible for or control as much wealth in Africa as Edgar Sengier. Born in 1870, Sengier trained to become an engineer at the University of Leuven in his native Flanders before moving to the Congo to begin work at the Union Miniére in 1911, just as the UMHK was beginning to expand into new markets and different directions. Heading the UMHK’s expansion at this opportune time, Sengier first aided the Union Miniére by helping build up its domestic copper industry. By applying his technical expertise in the construction of new mines and refineries in Katanga, Sengier made a name for himself as a shrewd foreman and sound logician, planting the seeds for his rise through the UMHK’s hierarchy. In the years since, Sengier has taken the Union Miniére du Haut Katanga to new heights, particularly taking a keen interest in expanding the uranium mines of the Congo due to a tip from his colleague Sir Henry Tizard, and the massive mining monopoly now stands as the largest company in all of Congo. Sengier’s ambitions knows no bounds as he endeavors to make the UMHK, and by extension himself, the richest single entity in Africa."

With the collapse of the Vrijstaat, the natives have grown unruly, and we must be careful not to push them over the edge, for they know we are now vulnerable and whispers of the Mwami’s return have put fear into the hearts of our more cowardly officials and employees."

### Focuses ###

UMN_the_union_minere:0 "The Union Minière"
UMN_the_union_minere_desc:0 "The Union Minière du Haut-Katanga, or as its more commonly called the Union Minière or UMHK, is a massive mining concern founded as a joint venture by Flandro-Wallonian and Anglo industrial, rail, and mining concerns already operating in the region in 1906. Since then, German interests have increasingly replaced the Anglos as the dominant partner to the Flandro-Wallonian operators, and as such, Germany has been able to benefit from the rich mineral wealth the UMHK extracts from the Earth. With the collapse of Mittelafrika and the Congo Vrijstaat, the UMHK has found itself adrift without the support of Europe for the first time since its foundation, and now they stand as the dominant force of power in Katanga. They must resist the swirling chaos that now engulfs them as it consumes the Congo, even as whispers of an old foe’s return circulate these jungles."

UMN_declare_independence:0 "A Formal Declaration of Independence"
UMN_declare_independence_desc:0 "We have been cast adrift onto this sea of chaos that has replaced and consumed the once pristine and placid region of Congo. To consolidate our rule as we find our company tossed into the role of a provisional government, we must issue a formal declaration of independence from the Congo colony. Under the leadership of Chief Director Edgar Sengier and the Union Minière board of directors, a new sovereign corporate state shall rise in Katanga. For good health, good spirits, and high productivity!"

UMN_fate_of_the_north:0 "Fate of the Congo"
UMN_fate_of_the_north_desc:0 "To the North of our capitalist haven, the rest of the Congo is embroiled in fierce war as mercenaries and natives rise against the colonialist machine. We must decide here and now what our policy towards these collapse-states shall be. Whether we soldier on to take these resource-rich lands for ourselves or choose to enjoy our splendid isolation here in Katanga, the UMHK will find profit wherever we go."

UMN_unify_congo:0 "From Katanga to All of Congo"
UMN_unify_congo_desc:0 "The vast colonial apparatus that once ruled over this region we call Congo had long squandered the unimaginable material wealth hidden within the jungles and bedrock of this primordial Eden. Only we, the newly christened ‘Union Minière du Grand Congo’ can truly appreciate and exploit the natural bounty that is this Dark Heart of Africa."

UMN_the_force_publique:0 "Join with the Force Publique"
UMN_the_force_publique_desc:0 "The Force Publique has long served as the final line of defense between Congo and absolute chaos. Their oppressive but effective tactics are infamous throughout the colony, and despite their aging equipment and dwindling White officer corp, the native in their employ make up for it with their savagery and tenacity. We must align with this last sword and shield of colonial rule in Congo, lest we face the wolves alone."

UMN_support_the_government:0 "Recognize the Vrijstaat"
UMN_support_the_government_desc:0 "The Vrijstaat, or Free State, is the rightful Congolese government, and as such, our natural allies. Long has the Union Minière served the Ryckmans Regime, and this cooperation shall continue. Our company makes up over two-thirds of the Congo’s economy. They simply can not survive without us, and we both know it."

UMN_rejoin_the_freestate:0 "Question of Unification"
UMN_rejoin_the_freestate_desc:0 "Though our territorial extent is small, we are the bigger player in these coming negotiations. As the richest entity in Congo, the Ryckmans Regime will simply not survive without the capital and resources that flow from our mines. We will approach them about unification, but if they choose to accept, we will hold their nation and all future ambitions of Congo by the balls."

UMN_secure_the_mines:0 "Secure Our Mines"
UMN_secure_the_mines_desc:0 "From the expansive Ruashi Copper Mine to the massive uranium and radon pits of Shinkolobwe, the mines and mineral extraction depots that stretch across our company’s domain are the backbone of our economy and our power. We must ensure that the mines are secured and protected from rebel tampering, for without these ore pits, the UMHK is nothing."

UMN_merc_strikebreakers:0 "Mercenary Strikebreakers"
UMN_merc_strikebreakers_desc:0 "Most of our industrial workforce consists of few and far between White formen and managers overseeing swaths of native laborers and workers. With the collapse of all sense of stability as Mittelafrika imploded, these natives, despite our seemingly ample pro-worker’s legislation, have risen up against our commands and have started to strike for better conditions and a greater say in the company. Luckily, the Congo is crawling with many mercenaries who will eagerly labour away or crack the heads of strikers, as long as they are paid - and if there is one thing we have no shortage of, its money."

UMN_our_buisness_is_buisness:0 "Our Business is Business"
UMN_our_buisness_is_buisness_desc:0 "Our business is business - the Union Minière is the richest company in Congo and one of the most profitable ventures in all of Africa. No organization, European or African, knows how to profit off the backs of natives in this bountiful paradise like we do, and none shall while we are around. No matter our positions or situation, the money must always flow."

UMN_the_mines_keep_running:0 "The Mines that Never Sleep"
UMN_the_mines_keep_running_desc:0 "Every minute of every day, the ground rumbles and the sky further blackens as our mining operations continue ever forward. At night, our forges and lanterns light up the night sky as our miners and foundrymen toil hard and ceaselessly; their burden never ending. Tin, cobalt, copper, uranium, cadmium, silver, gold, manganese, and so much more are ripped from the earth without end, for our mines never sleep, and neither do our workers."

UMN_belgian_ancapistan:0 "A Congo Rolling in Cash"
UMN_belgian_ancapistan_desc:0 "We have taken control over the vast expanse of what once was the Congo Vrijstaat, and now it is up to us to administer this massive, bountiful region. The Union Minière du Grand Congo has risen, and all of the Congo will be made into our financial playground as the UMGC moves to tap into every possible avenue for profit available to us. The cash will flow and Chief Director Sengier and the rest of the company shall be rolling in more capital than they know what to do with. All turns to gold in the Congo."

UMN_exploiting_the_congo:0 "Exploiting Eden"
UMN_exploiting_the_congo_desc:0 "The Congo Rainforest and the surrounding wilds are some of the most beautiful, wondrous, and diverse natural ecosystems in the known world. Not only does this region hold more biodiversity in both flora and fauna than anywhere else on Earth save maybe the Amazon, but this living paradise also holds under its soil and within its thickets a treasure trove of profitable riches unlike the world has ever seen. It is the Union Minière’s destiny to be the ones to break open this treasure once and for all, and so we will sweep across every square mile of this Garden of Eden, reaping profit with every ore vein broken into and every hardwood tree cut down."

UMN_ties_with_home:0 "A Journey Home to Brussels"
UMN_ties_with_home_desc:0 "Now that we have established ourselves as the rightful government of the former territory of the Congo Vrijstaat, we should make overtures with the nation that birthed our very existence. Without their recognition and aid, establishing ourselves on the international market will be much more difficult, as currently many nations see us as a rogue corporate state. To Brussels, we go!"

UMN_work_harder:0 "Good Health..."
UMN_work_harder_desc:0 "We must ensure we have a steadily supplied and amble workforce in order to fulfill the quotas we have put in place to maintain the demand we have sparked due to our successful financial endeavors. We profess good health, and we mean it - the health of our profit margins that is! Work our forgers and smiths hard and the miners harder, and rotate them on shifts so work carries on non-stop indefinitely. The forges must never grow cold and the minecarts must never arrive from the depths empty, so we must work, work, work!"

UMN_uranium_diplomacy:0 "Uranium Diplomacy"
UMN_uranium_diplomacy_desc:0 "With our access to Shinkolobwe, we control one of the greatest deposits of nuclear material on Earth in the form of massive uranium and radium mines. Using the precious, yet dangerously radioactive, cargo sourced from this mine, we shall leverage our way into the arms of one of the great powers. This shall secure our newfound independence and garner us new allies and trade partners, all in exchange for a few tons of ore."

UMN_control_the_miners:0 "Good Spirits..."
UMN_control_the_miners_desc:0 "Worker moral is a fickle thing, but a happy, or motivated, worker is a productive worker. We are one of the wealthiest conglomerates on this planet, so we can afford to toss our thousands of labourers devent benefits to quell their natural tendency to complain, strike, and rebel. There is always Plan B if these incentives and benefits fail to sufficiently inspire our workforce to toil, for the Force Publique is always only a call away..."

UMN_rolling_in_cash:0 "...and High Productivity"
UMN_rolling_in_cash_desc:0 "At the end of the day, the bottom line is the most important aspect of our operation. Everything we do, everything we have done, and everything we shall continue to do has been in the endless pursuit of profit. We are the largest company in all of Africa, and one of the largest in Humanity’s history. Like the A.O.G or the East Indian Trading Company of old, we have bent a continent to our own whims as we endeavor to ever higher levels of success and fortune, for it is the destiny of the Union Minière du Grand Congo to become the richest nation in history!"

UMN_lighter_hand:0 "A Lighter Hand"
UMN_lighter_hand_desc:0 "If we are to keep control over Katanga and the swathe of natives we now lord over, we are going to need to think about long-term cooperation. We will not be able to sustain our precarious position of power by oppressing the Africans, so we must take a lighter approach if we hope to keep the profits coming. Non-Socialist unions shall be allowed to organize, fairer hours and safer work conditions shall be ensured, pay will be increased, and more to show the native Katangans we are here to stay and that we are serious about administering these lands."

UMN_congolese_industraial_revolution:0 "The Congolese Industrial Revolution"
UMN_congolese_industraial_revolution_desc:0 "To hell with the whims and needs of the natives! What the UMHK needs is of the utmost importance, above all. We do not need to take a softer approach, but instead we must double down on our profit-seeking mission. Katanga must be transformed into a state where profit matters above all, and to fuel this drive, a new industrial revolution here in the southern expanse of the Congo shall be jump started. Sure, factory conditions, working conditions, and the overall condition of the environment shall all suffer, but they are all necessary to achieve maximum profit."

UMN_minor_labour_regulations:0 "Minor Pragmatic Labour Regulations"
UMN_minor_labour_regulations_desc:0 "We must be pragmatic in our legislation lest the natives who compose most of our workforce shall overthrow our Board without second thought. More minor regulations shall be passed to appease these labourers while a new pragmatic attitude towards our native policy shall be fully adopted. Though not every choice made and agreement reached will please both parties fully, we must at least maintain a balance between profit and employee satisfaction, lest this whole capitalist experiment collapse."

UMN_allow_blacks_positions:0 "Give Prominent Natives Token Positions"
UMN_allow_blacks_positions_desc:0 "To alleviate tensions with the native Congolese peoples, we must grant token positions within our administration to prominent Africans within our borders. Figures such as Moïse Tshombe and Godefroid Munongo, among many others, shall be given seats on the UMHK’s Board of Directors while lesser figures are allotted to far less important roles, sprinkling enough diversity hires around enough to appease the masses as we feign cooperation."

UMN_hire_administrators:0 "Hire New Administrators and Soldiers"
UMN_hire_administrators_desc:0 "As we expand our administration and operations, we will need more blood to fill the ranks of our growing bureaucracy. Former colonial figures, prominent tycoons and business moguls, soldiers, and even mercenaries shall all be hired from across the wider Congo and Mittelafrika, beckoning any and all seeking fortune and freedom to come to our borders. Though we will likely be forced to take in many candidates far less than qualified, it must be done to fill-out this infantile administration. "

UMN_corporate_administrative_bureaucracy:0 "Corporate Administrative Bureaucracy"
UMN_corporate_administrative_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The governmental apparatus of our capitalism-fueled state is entirely built around the UMHK. This monopolistic leviathan controls all aspects of Katanga’s government, economy, and entire socioeconomic system. The company is the final say, the only say, in all matters and everything flows back to the Board of Directors one way or another. Their eyes are everywhere and their lackeys every patrol as the skies of Katanga and beyond turn black with the smoke of Capitalism’s dominance and progress. Life and civilization itself in Katanga is owned by the UMHK, and nothing can stop their pursuit of profit now as the corporate bureaucracy continues to grow."

unionminere.1.t:0 "The Largest Company in Congo"
unionminere.1.d:0 "No company or other single entity within Congo is more economically dominant than the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga. Formed in 1906 as a joint venture of the Flandro-Wallonian Compagnie du Katanga and Comite Special du Katanga with the Anglo company Tanganyika Concessions LTD., the UMHK has grown over the decades to become dominant like none other. Controlling mines, refineries, factories, processing and shipping centers, their own rail infrastructure, and so much more, this monopoly of monopolies rivals the East India Company in its influence and power. Having a controlling interest in roughly 70% of the Congo’s total economy, it is safe to say that this miner’s union effectively controls the financial sector of the Congo. \n\nWith the collapse of the Vrijstaat, the Lead Director of the Union Minière, [UMN.getleader], the UMHK has had to quickly establish a makeshift governmental structure as it has become responsible over swathes of Katanga. This company-turned-state must now establish itself in this rising tide of chaos and destruction, for the wolves circle it at every moment. To the North, mercenaries and native Askari have risen up to fight for their right of sovereignty, and within our own borders, whispers have spread of the Mwami’s return. We must remain vigilant as we build up our new corporate state, for even all the money in the world can not save us if we fail now."
unionminere.1.a:0 "To Good Health, Good Spirits, and High Productivity!"

unionminere.2.t:0 "Our Benefactors in Katanga Make an Offer"
unionminere.2.d:0 "The capitalist-dominated provisional government in Haut-Katanga under Director Edgar Sengier has petitioned our government to join their growing coalition of colonialist holdouts. If we accepted, we would be forced under the rule of the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga and Sengier, throwing away our sovereignty for mere autonomy under their control. Alternatively, we could just deny this ludicrous request, but as a result we may have to face the wrath of the UMHK on the open battlefield. How shall we respond?"
unionminere.2.a:0 "The Force Publique needs no greed-fueled benefactors any longer."
unionminere.2.b:0 "With their capital funding our state, we shall be unstoppable!"

unionminere.3.t:0 "An Unprofitable Denial"
unionminere.3.d:0 "The fools that run the Force Publique provisional government in Leopoldville have denied our request for unification, and now we are left with a choice. We could either merely forget this transgression and leave them to their own fate, or we could triumphantly march into Leopoldville and cut these traitors down for good. How shall we proceed?"
unionminere.3.a:0 "Send in the Mercs and the Union guards, for the Force Publique falls today!"
unionminere.3.b:0 "We do not need these decadent urban fools."

unionminere.4.t:0 "A Deal is Struck"
unionminere.4.d:0 "Our likeminded allies and countrymen in the Force Publique of Leopoldville have accepted our generous request at unification.

unionminere.5.d:0 "The resurgent Vrijstaat has beaten back the mercenary and native hordes, and now stand as the dominant power in the Congo once again. With their victory, these imperialists have come knockin on our doors once more asking for us to reintegrate ourselves back into the wider Vrijstaat’s colonial government. If we were to accept, we would be fully integrated back into their borders, though given autonomy and extra incentives and benefits for agreeing to holster our weapons for the good of our employees and our profit margins. However, we could just simply deny these fools instead, seeing as they already failed their previous mandate to rule, though doing so would likely incur their wrath. How shall we respond?"
unionminere.5.a:0 "Together, for the good of the colony."
unionminere.5.b:0 "What was the point of this revolt then?! Deny them at once!"

unionminere.6.t:0 "A New Wave of Worker Unrest"
unionminere.6.d:0 "As the atmosphere of instability continues to grow within Katanga due to the violent and chaotic civil war, tensions within our struggling corporate state have risen near the breaking point. Miners and refinery workers across the plots and properties held by the UMHK have risen up in strike and protest, demanding better pay, safer working conditions, and shorter shifts along with other minor social welfare, for they have realized that they are the lifeblood of our company and our power. Worse still, due to our recently ‘earned’ independence, our workforce has been greatly limited, increasing the damage these rapidly spreading strikes have done to our economy and political influence. Without the money flowing and the gears of industry spinning, greased with the promise of profit and opportunity, our hold over Katanga will quickly crumble. We are a literal corporate state, and without a functioning and profitable corporation, our regime is not only doomed to fail but is virtually non-existent. These riots and strikes will need to be dealt with soon lest we desire for our feeble hold over this expanse to collapse, especially with the rumors of old foes regaining their strength in the dense jungles that surround and isolate us."
unionminere.6.a:0 "We will watch these strikes like hawks as we devise a plan forward."

unionminere.7.t:0 "A Possible Response to the Riots"
unionminere.7.d:0 "The various disconnected strikes, riots, and protests across Katanga have coalesced into a cohesive general strike, grinding the apparatus of the state to a complete standstill. With this crisis not having reached such a critical stage, many within the UMHK’s administration had called for drastic and harsh action to be taken to deal with the riots. These scared tycoons and captains of industry seek to pay off as many mercenaries as possible to function as emergency strike breakers while using refugees from the civil war as underpaid strike scabs. This sweeping plan would hopefully crush the spirits of these protestors as we move to consolidate our rule. \n\nHowever, many on the Board of Directors feel that this plan is far too drastic, likely to cause more problems than it would solve and only further angering the native Africans. These more level-headed administrators believe that only through negotiation with these strikers can there be any hope of peace, and Edgar Sengier has expressed his sympathy with this more moderate group behind closed doors. Whatever our Board’s final decision is, we must make it delicately, for Katanga inches closer to collapse by the day."
unionminere.7.a:0 "Heed Sengier’s warnings and work towards a peaceful solution."
unionminere.7.b:0 "Send in the scabs and mercs, it's strikebreaking time!"

unionminere.8.t:0 "Old Foes Reemerge"
unionminere.8.d:0 "With our decision to crack down harshly on the African workers striking against our regime, old foes have begun to rise from the primordial expanses of Katanga and beyond. From within the jungles and disconnected villages that remain untouched by our monopoly has once again risen the Mwami, heir to the Yeke Kingdom and ‘rightful’ ruler of Katanga. Patriarch of the Bayeke, or Garanganze, people and noble descendent of the Msiri, Mwami Kitanika and his loyal forces wage a guerilla war against our regime as they did against Ryckmans before us. Though his forces are dwindling due to his failed war against the Vrijstaat, he has still proven to be a thorn in our side, and some believe he is to blame for the recent rise in protests and strikes. Though this claim is dubious, with the protest more likely forming as a response to both our new rule in the wake of the civil war and our abhorrent managerial practices, this has not stopped the Mwami from becoming a scapegoat for our issues. With our situation growing more dire by the minute and with our resources already stretched so thin, our regime must make a choice. Should we waste precious weapons, supplies, and manpower, all resources we have little to spare, to deal with this minor tribalist threat to show the nation that something is being done to deal with the unrest, or shall we simply let this mad king rave as we deal with the larger issues at hand."
unionminere.8.a:0 "Break out the rifles, boys! It’s time to hunt some guerillas."
unionminere.8.b:0 "The last ditch efforts of a failed king are trivial. Let us return to our brandy and cigars."

unionminere.9.t:0 "The Mwami Plays His Hand Once More"
unionminere.9.d:0 "We have been foolish, too busy pursuing profit and dealing with the strikers, too long ignoring the rising tribalist threat, and now it may be too late to save our precious capitalist experiment. Even now, the forces of Mwami Kitanika Mabumba Mushalila and his brother Munongo march against us, and across Katanga more and more of our outlying mines and outposts go dark, failing to hail back to us on any frequency. These centers of our influence have slipped away without so much as a word of notice, and with each that falls, our hold over Katanga grows ever weaker. \n\nIn a final showdown outside the UMHK’s main compound in Elisabethville, the soul of Katanga is on the line as a large force of Mwami loyalists, all fervent supporters of the House of Msiri."
unionminere.9.a:0 "All that is needed is a bit of lead paid in gold; send in the mercs."
unionminere.9.b:0 "The Mwami, heir of the great Msiri and father of the Bayeke people, seizes power."

unionminere.10.t:0 "The Rebirth of the Yeke Kingdom"
unionminere.10.d:0 "The impossible has been completed - the colonialist dogs that have long infected the Congo have been cast out - and now the Bayeke people of Katanga breathe free air once again for the first time in decades. Mwami Kitanika Mabumba Mushalila and his brother, heirs to Msiri and champions of the people of Garanganze, are the liberators of Katanga, and now shall oversee the recreation of their ancestral kingdom. Pushing for a return to tradition, expanding resource extraction, consolidation of power under the Mwami’s kingdom, and slight reforms to model this resurgent monarchy after the enlightened Chrstian monarchies of Europe, the Mwami and his loyal forces shall finally free Katanga from the vices of colonialism and drag these primordial lands into the future, without losing sight of their tradition and tribalist roots."
unionminere.10.a:0 "The Yeke Kingdom rises once more atop the ashes of the UMHK."

unionminere.11.t:0 "Our Greatest Diplomatic Asset"
unionminere.11.d:0 "Of all the resource extraction sites, miners, and refineries within the Congo under the control of the UMHK, none is more important than Shinkolobwe. Also known as Kasolo or Chinkolobew, this massive mine at the heart of the Kambove mining region in Katanga is one of the largest single deposits of uranium on Earth, providing untold amounts of uranium and radium for us to extract and sell. With recent scientific advances, the potential of such a material is quickly being realized, and every great power on the planet is chomping at the bit for access to any known deposits of the stuff. \n\nThis lucrative nature could prove to be our greatest bargaining chip, as every nation with a hand in international diplomacy seeks to harness the power of this ore for themselves, yet most lack the necessary access to uranium and other elements like it to do it. With this in mind, we shall use our stores of uranium as leverage as we seek to find new allies to protect our newly independent capitalist haven. The most beneficial candidates for us to reach out to are of course Germany and the Entente - both the current and former colonial overlords of Africa. Whoever we reach out to shall be offered the necessary materials to unlock and harness the secrets of the atom, and all they need to do in return is supply our troops and keep our borders safe."
unionminere.11.a:0 "Reach out to the Kaiserreich, for they are the true and proven hegemon."
unionminere.11.b:0 "Though in exile, the Entente has proven their righteousness. Reach out to Ottawa."

unionminere.12.t:0 "Nuclear-Fueled Overtures From Katanga"
unionminere.12.d:0 "We have received a curious yet enticing proposal from the far-off land of Katanga, nestled in the southern reaches of the Congo. From this primordial eden, the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga has petitioned our regime with a most unexpected request. These capitalists have unmitigated access and ownership over Shinkolobwe, one of the world’s largest uranium mines. They have offered full access to their stores of this precious fissile material under the condition that we admit them into our alliance and offer them our protection. While doing so would further entangle us within African affairs, it would also align us with one of the richest and largest companies in Africa - and the only one both functioning as an independent state and with such easy access to one of the most sought-after materials on the planet. We must decide how to go about this situation, for this deal could change the face of history as we know it."
unionminere.12.a:0 "Accept the ore, for Germany shall harness its power for Gott und Kaiser."
unionminere.12.b:0 "Perhaps, on second thought, we should pursue other avenues to unlock the secrets of the atom."

unionminere.14.t:0 "Nuclear-Fueled Overtures from Katanga"
