AUS_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
AUS_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecesors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
AUS_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
AUS_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
AUS_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the aging fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
AUS_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
AUS_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
AUS_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

AUS_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
AUS_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
AUS_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would ressurect the D.IV monicker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
AUS_fighter_equipment_1: "WNF Wn.21"
AUS_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Wn.21"
AUS_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "The 1935 Wn.21, designed by nascent designer August Stepan, was a culmination of all the Dual Monarchy's efforts to bring the K.u.K. Luftfahrtruppen into the modern age. A currently-experimental Wiener Neuestadter design has been specifically alloted into German-Austrian service to test its capabilities over the standard Avia B.534. Outfitted with a radical new design of cannons over the regular machine guns, the Wn.21 has yet to earn its stars."
AUS_fighter_equipment_2: "WNF Wn.24"
AUS_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Wn.24"
AUS_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "Continuing in the direction that the Wn.21 established, the Wn.24 was approved with near immediacy by the Luftfahrtruppen. The order was simply to update and optimize the performance of the Wn.21 - while excellent at its duties, the aircraft suffered from an engine weighed down by its weapons. The new design, the Wn.24, sports new cannons and a more powerful 820 hp Austro-Daimler V10D engine."
AUS_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
AUS_fighter_equipment_3_short: "B.224"
AUS_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."
AUS_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia Bf.262"
AUS_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf.262"
AUS_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Lagging behind in the development of jet fighters, Avia acquired a license to produce the Bf 262 for the Fliegerkorps, replacing the German 30mm guns with locally-produced 20mm guns in their slightly-revised design."
AUS_jet_fighter_equipment_2: "Letov L.52"
AUS_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "L.52"
AUS_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "When Austro-Daimler developed the U2 'Uzelac' engine, Letov produced a state-of-the-art jet fighter that would become the Monarchy's first local jet aircraft adopted into service."

AUS_nav_bomber_equipment_3_short: "WM.442"
AUS_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.442 is the seaplane variant of the WM.44 made for the Seefliegerkorps, intended for Adriatic and Mediterranean anti-ship operations."

AUS_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "Praga E.51"
AUS_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "E.51"
AUS_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Initially designed as a reconnaissance aircraft, it was quickly determined that the E.51 could be quickly adapted as a heavy fighter to counter strategic bombers."
AUS_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.31"
AUS_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "WM.31"
AUS_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "The Hungarian aviation engineer László Varga designed this 3-seat fighter around experimental gas turbine engines. However, technical difficulties arised over the engines and were replaced by two Austro-Daimler V12D instead. Notably, the WM.31 was of mixed construction."
AUS_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.50"
AUS_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "WM.50"
AUS_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.50 was a rather advanced designed for its time: The two engine push-pull configuration, twin-boom aircraft by Lázló Varga was designed to significantly improve the performance of two-engine fighters to counter high-altitude bombers."

AUS_tac_bomber_equipment_0: "Avia F.39"
AUS_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "F.39"
AUS_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "Originally developed by Fokker as a transport craft, the F.IX, the Avia company quickly saw the plane's military potential, and upon receiving a licence for the aircraft, redesigned the F.IX as a bomber, the F.39. The Dual Monarchy, lacking sufficient bombers, adopted the F.39 as a stopgap while newed models were developed."
AUS_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š-50"
AUS_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š-50"
AUS_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Intending to fill the Fliegerkorps' request for a multirole two-engine, three-man crew aircraft, Letov submitted the Š-50. However, the design did not catch interest and would never be produced, with Aero's design being eventually adopted instead."

CRO_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
CRO_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would ressurect the D.IV monicker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."

CRO_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."

FIN_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Developed from the Canadian Beaufort medium bomber in line with Canada's own Beaufighter design, the VL Tähti has been signifcantly lightened and its armaments and engine retrofitted for its new role. Though, unlike the Canadian Beaufighter, the bombardier's compartment has not been removed. Instead, the Tähti features a rotating front turret."

FIN_fighter_equipment_0_short: "C.VI.25"
FIN_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "The C.VI.25 has had a troubled development history - its first operational model crashed due to an underpowered engine. The Siemens engine was replaced with a more modern German one, and outfitted with dual machine guns - and thus Finland's standard fighter was born."

FIN_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Myrsky"
FIN_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In the 1930s, Finland realized that it was rapidly falling behind its allies and enemies alike in fighter designs, lacking a steel-framed monoplane entirely. The Myrsky was designed by the Finnish state aircraft factory on the basis of German designs and featuring a Canadian engine."

GAL_CAS_equipment_1: "Aero Vodochody A.101"
GAL_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
GAL_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecesors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
GAL_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
GAL_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
GAL_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the aging fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
GAL_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
GAL_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
GAL_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

GAL_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
GAL_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
GAL_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would ressurect the D.IV monicker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
GAL_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
GAL_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
GAL_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
GAL_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
GAL_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
GAL_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equiped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
GAL_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
GAL_fighter_equipment_3_short: "B.224"
GAL_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."
GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia Bf.262"
GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf.262"
GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Lagging behind in the development of jet fighters, Avia acquired a license to produce the Bf 262 for the Fliegerkorps, replacing the German 30mm guns with locally-produced 20mm guns in their slightly-revised design."
GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_2: "Letov L.52"
GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "L.52"
GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "When Austro-Daimler developed the U2 'Uzelac' engine, Letov produced a state-of-the-art jet fighter that would become the Monarchy's first local jet aircraft adopted into service."

GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "F.39"
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "Originally developed by Fokker as a transport craft, the F.IX, the Avia company quickly saw the plane's military potential, and upon receiving a licence for the aircraft, redesigned the F.IX as a bomber, the F.39. The Dual Monarchy, lacking sufficient bombers, adopted the F.39 as a stopgap while newed models were developed."
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š-50"
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š-50"
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Intending to fill the Fliegerkorps' request for a multirole two-engine, three-man crew aircraft, Letov submitted the Š-50. However, the design did not catch interest and would never be produced, with Aero's design being eventually adopted instead."
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Aero Vodochody A.300"
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "A.300"
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "This bomber design by Antonín Husník was, when it entered service, one of the fastest aircraft in inventory, only behind the newly-adopted B.135 fighter. Fast and with a good payload, it proved to be a versatile bomber and reconaissance aircract."
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.311"
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short: "WM.311"
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.31 was quickly adapted to perform the role of a fast, tactical bomber by weakening its offensive armament and improving its payload capacity."

HUN_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecesors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."

HUN_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the aging fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."

HUN_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would ressurect the D.IV monicker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."

HUN_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."

SLO_CAS_equipment_1: "Aero Vodochody A.101"
SLO_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
SLO_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecesors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
SLO_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
SLO_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
SLO_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the aging fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
SLO_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
SLO_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
SLO_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

SLO_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
SLO_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
SLO_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would ressurect the D.IV monicker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
SLO_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
SLO_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
SLO_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
SLO_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
SLO_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
SLO_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equiped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
SLO_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
SLO_fighter_equipment_3_short: "B.224"
SLO_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."
SLO_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia Bf.262"
SLO_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf.262"
SLO_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Lagging behind in the development of jet fighters, Avia acquired a license to produce the Bf 262 for the Fliegerkorps, replacing the German 30mm guns with locally-produced 20mm guns in their slightly-revised design."
SLO_jet_fighter_equipment_2: "Letov L.52"
SLO_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "L.52"
SLO_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "When Austro-Daimler developed the U2 'Uzelac' engine, Letov produced a state-of-the-art jet fighter that would become the Monarchy's first local jet aircraft adopted into service."

SLO_nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š.328.v"
SLO_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š.328.v"
SLO_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The Š.328.v was the seaplane derivative of the Š.28 series. It was armed with two forward-firing 8mm machine guns and two more in a flexible mount at the rear, and had a payload capacity of around 500kg."
SLO_nav_bomber_equipment_2: "Lohner-Fokker T.VIII W/C"
SLO_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "T.VIII W/C"
SLO_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Lohner, a company that previously made seaplanes and flying boats for the k.u.k. Seefliegerkorps during the war, acquired the rights to produce the Fokker T.VIII for the Austro-Hungarian Navy."
SLO_nav_bomber_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.442"
SLO_nav_bomber_equipment_3_short: "WM.442"
SLO_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.442 is the seaplane variant of the WM.44 made for the Seefliegerkorps, intended for Adriatic and Mediterranean anti-ship operations."

SLO_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "Praga E.51"
SLO_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "E.51"
SLO_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Initially designed as a reconnaissance aircraft, it was quickly determined that the E.51 could be quickly adapted as a heavy fighter to counter strategic bombers."
SLO_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.31"
SLO_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "WM.31"
SLO_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "The Hungarian aviation engineer László Varga designed this 3-seat fighter around experimental gas turbine engines. However, technical difficulties arised over the engines and were replaced by two Austro-Daimler V12D instead. Notably, the WM.31 was of mixed construction."
SLO_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.50"
SLO_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "WM.50"
SLO_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.50 was a rather advanced designed for its time: The two engine push-pull configuration, twin-boom aircraft by Lázló Varga was designed to significantly improve the performance of two-engine fighters to counter high-altitude bombers."

SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_0: "Avia F.39"
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "F.39"
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "Originally developed by Fokker as a transport craft, the F.IX, the Avia company quickly saw the plane's military potential, and upon receiving a licence for the aircraft, redesigned the F.IX as a bomber, the F.39. The Dual Monarchy, lacking sufficient bombers, adopted the F.39 as a stopgap while newed models were developed."
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š-50"
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š-50"
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Intending to fill the Fliegerkorps' request for a multirole two-engine, three-man crew aircraft, Letov submitted the Š-50. However, the design did not catch interest and would never be produced, with Aero's design being eventually adopted instead."
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Aero Vodochody A.300"
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "A.300"
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "This bomber design by Antonín Husník was, when it entered service, one of the fastest aircraft in inventory, only behind the newly-adopted B.135 fighter. Fast and with a good payload, it proved to be a versatile bomber and reconaissance aircract."
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.311"
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short: "WM.311"
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.31 was quickly adapted to perform the role of a fast, tactical bomber by weakening its offensive armament and improving its payload capacity."
SLO_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov L.11"
SLO_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "L.11"
SLO_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Based on a jet fighter design by the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, the L.11 adapted the design into a fast and light jet bomber for multiple roles, hoping to replace the Monarchy's fleet of older prop-driven tactical bombers."
SLO_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Aero L.44"
SLO_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "L.44"
SLO_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "With the reliability of jet engines increasing and competition ever-so fierce, Aero tackled the challenge to design a next-generation fast-bomber, culminating into the L.44 fast bomber."

SLO_strat_bomber_equipment_1: "Avia-Dornier Do.19"
SLO_strat_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Do.19"
SLO_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Lacking designs for strategic bombers, Avia purchased a number of Dornier four-engine bombers to showcase the their potential to the air force."

SVK_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
SVK_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecesors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
SVK_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
SVK_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
SVK_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the aging fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
SVK_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
SVK_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
SVK_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

SVK_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
SVK_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would ressurect the D.IV monicker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."

SVK_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
SVK_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
SVK_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
SVK_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
SVK_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equiped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."

SVK_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."

SWE_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "An old interwar biplane fighter built by Svenska Aero first in the 20s, and then by AB Svenska Järnvägsverkstädernas Aeroplanavdelning, used in all Scandinavia. Despite its efficiency for patrol and reconnaissance missions, it has had its day in our air force and will be not suitable for the requirements of the modern air warfare."

SWE_fighter_equipment_1_short: "J 9"
SWE_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "An American built fighter, made by the Serverski company. The US air military chose its competitor, the P-36, from the Curtiss company, but it's reliable and perfectly fills our needs for our missions above Sweden. After some negociations, Seversky sold us the manufacturing rights and the plans, allowing us to produce it."

SWE_fighter_equipment_2_short: "J 22"
SWE_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "The J 22, designed by Kungliga Flygförvaltningens Flygverkstad i Stockholm, is our first locally designed monoplane fighter. Appreciated by our pilots for its maniablity, it is also easy to maintain. It should allow us to defend Sweden efficiently from any threats."

SWE_fighter_equipment_3_short: "J 27"
SWE_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "The air warfare has evolved during the second Weltkrieg, and because of the intensive aerial fights above the Baltic, a lot of foreign planes planes could not find their way back to their home bases or just crashed on our shores. After there capture (or their recovery for the unluckiest ones), our technical units studied a lot these fighters of a new kind. Because the J 21 didn't met the needed requirements to be an efficient fighter, those studies resulted into the J 27, a modern fighter inspired from German and American designs, but mostly from the British Supermarine 'Spitfire'. A powerful engine, a high maniability, a contra-rotating propeller, powerful armament.. our 'Svensk Super Spitfire' will be a nightmare for the countries which dare to invade us!"

SWE_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "After years of R&D, we've finally managed to build a jet fighter. The piston engine fighter J 21, which wasn't very efficient as a fighter, that's a fact. But it's a reliable and strong platform. Repowered with a jet engine and armed with 20 mm guns, the J 21R is entirely capable of defending our skies against the air invaders of the next years. No more propellers, time is for jets now."

The J 29 is the climax of our air industry: it has an advanced radar, bigger fuel tanks, air to air missiles and high speed. If we continue to build planes like the 'Tunnan', the skies of Sweden are guaranteed for the future."

It is a bit limited, but greatly plays his role of air support for our ground forces. Thanks to the American engineering, the aircraft cell isn't complex and allows us to install winter equipment, including skis for the landing gear."
SWE_CAS_equipment_2: "SAAB B 17"
SWE_CAS_equipment_2_short: "B 17"
SWE_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "After studying the latest attacker aircraft designs of the other powers in Europe, we have successfully managed to create a local aircraft capable to conduct efficiently air-to-ground support missions. The B 17, designed by SAAB, is well powered, capable of use a lot of bombs and can perform dive bombing. Its landing gears are also modulars, which allow us to install skis and floats."

Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the aging fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
TRS_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
TRS_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
TRS_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

TRS_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
TRS_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
TRS_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would ressurect the D.IV monicker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."

TRS_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
TRS_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
TRS_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
TRS_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
TRS_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equiped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
TRS_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
