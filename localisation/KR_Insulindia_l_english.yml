### Leaders ###
POLITICS_SUKARNO_DESC:0 "The son of Javanese aristocrats, the young Sukarno came into the world in 1901. Sukarno first become interested in politics when he was introduced to unique philosophy of a farmer named Marhaen. Marhaen's personal political philosophy inspired Sukarno to found the PNI in 1926. Sukarno's other great influence being the Algemeene Studieclub, which studied Dutch translations of the German constitution to form their basis of elected rule. Now that independence is here, Sukarno is beholden to the many faiths and desperate ideologies of Insulindia to unify all people in the peninsula."
POLITICS_TAN_MALAKA_DESC:0 "Tan Malaka has always walked a tight rope between orthodox and heterodox beliefs. In religion, Tan's support of Sarekat Islam, an egalitarian Islamist organisation, contrasted against the hierarchy of religious leadership. His commitment towards socialist thought also contrasted against the prevailing trade unionism that was growing in Europe. Between the lines Tan has pushed cooperation towards a brighter future."
POLITICS_SUTAN_DESC:0 "A student of Amsterdam University during the fierce debates of the late 1920s, Sutan's observations turned him away from revolutionary socialism and towards the economic theories of cooperative socialism. Upon his return to Indonesia, he attempted to join the PNI. Issues with the self-sufficiency message expressed by Sukarno led to him exit from the party. In defiance of the ban on socialist parties imposed by the Dutch, Sutan created the PSI under his own very loose definition of socialism."
POLITICS_HASHIM_ASYARI_DESC:0 "Long before the world was shaken by war, Hasyim's was destroyed while he was unaware. During his Hajj, his wife and child in Java died. Upon his return he saw both the apathy of Muslim authorities and the oppression of the Dutch as intolerable. Hasyim used this anger to ascend through the NU to transform the relationship between Islamic teachers and their students from directional to mutual."
POLITICS_MUNAWAR_MUSSO_DESC:0 "Musso was one of the leaders of the revolutionaries in 1925, a revolution inspired by the British one which was swiftly crushed by the colonial authorities and eventually resulted in the destruction of the PKI, forcing Musso to flee to the People's Republic of Bengal, from where he got into touch with Totalist thinkers from Europe. Convinced by the revolutionary ideas of this new movement, Musso hosted a reading and translation of the Totalist Charter among Insulindian exiles in Calcutta, subsequently forming the Partai Totalis Insulindia (PTI) that was to be the successor of the PKI. This definitively alienated Tan Malaka and his followers as the PTI rejected collaboration with Muslims towards independence, setting the stage for a permanent split in Insulindian socialism."
POLITICS_SEMAUN_DESC:0 "While many other Insulindian independence leaders avoided deportation by the Dutch, a group of vocal trade unionists lead by Semaun were caught trying to organize a trade union meeting in Surabaya and deported to the Legation Cities. From this exile Semaun grew in power by drawing attention to the miserable working conditions in factories. As his trade union was becoming more and more popular with Malayan immigrants, distance support from Sarekat Islam dried up. The mantle to uphold trade unionism was picked up by agents of the Third internationale, who assisted Semaun in founding the PVI. Now, Semaun's dramatic return has brought new issues that integrating with a political left that distrusts him."
POLITICS_WESTERLING_DESC:0 "Out of all the nations for Westerling to land in, Insulindia was his last choice, although he had adopted Islam at a young age, his relations with Sarekat Islam and leftism couldn't be worse. His unit in Insulindia was both famous and infamous for their discipline and lack of emotions in carrying out their tasks. In the utter chaos of strife that engulfed the nation. Westerling emerged as a very much foreign influence within the nation of many foreigners. That has given Westerling an sort of outsider edge that allowed him to crawl to the top of the heap."

### Events ###
 ins.1.t:0 "Assassination on Sukarno"
 ins.1.d:0 "Our president Sukarno was visiting Sumatra today when someone hurled a grenade at him. The suspect was quickly detained and revealed to be a Darul Islam militant, but the status of our president remains unclear at the moment, did the bomb fail to explode and did he survive or did the Darul Islam scum succeed in their evil plot to destabilize our government?"
 ins.1.a:0 "The grenade didn't blow: the president is fine!"
 ins.1.b:0 "The president died, the vice president becomes acting president..."
 ins.2.t:0 "Attempted Coup"
 ins.2.d:0 "Shortly after the attack on our president, Darul Islam militants attacked key strategic points all over Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi, with their troops taking control over a radio station and declaring the establishment of a Negara Islam Insulindia - an Insulindian Islamic state, in response to the heathenly secularisation of president Sukarno."
 ins.2.a:0 "The militants are pushed back in Jakarta and shortly after chased back into the jungle!"
 ins.2.b:0 "The militants secure the strategic points and following a mass defection take control!"
 ins.3.t:0 "Royalist Countercoup!"
 ins.3.d:0 "Witnessing the takeover by the traditionalist Darul Islam, the more western-minded sultans of the many sultans in the archipelago decided to take action. Rallying their supporters and armies they marched on Jakarta to save Insulindia from doomed Islamist rule, hoping to rally support from the non-muslim community of Insulindia and moderates."
 ins.3.a:0 "...upon which the militants beat them back!"
 ins.3.b:0 "...upon which Jakarta is secured by the rebels!"
 ins.4.t:0 "[GetYear] Elections"
 ins.4.d:0 "The president has decided legislative elections are to go ahead, hoping to secure a large majority for his PNI party and a mandate from the Insulindian people. The other parties, like Tan Malaka's Partai Murba and the newly formed PPP, and to a lesser degree the PSI (though suffering from a loss of voters to Murba) are campaigning zealously, arguing they are the best choice for a bright Insulindian future."
 ins.4.a:0 "Murba secures the workers' vote!"
 ins.4.b:0 "PPP wins on its mandate of religious democracy!"
 ins.4.c:0 "Sukarno's hopes are fulfilled and the PNI wins the Dewan!"
 ins.4.e:0 "The Dewan is hung and the PNI is forced into a coalition with PPP."
 ins.5.t:0 "Inauguration of president Sukarno"
 ins.5.d:0 "Having secured the independence of our country, the time has come to officially inaugurate president Sukarno as president of our nation. The ceremony takes place in Yogyakarta, in the Kraton palace. Sukarno soon arrived in his white ceremonial suit, and proceeded to swear the oath of office after an Islamic priest offered a prayer for our country's future. Our nation has become a little more real today!"
 ins.5.a:0 "Long live the president!"
 ins.6.t:0 "Meeting with the President"
 ins.6.d:0 "Tan Malaka realized that while his electoral victory was great step towards power, he would have to proceed carefully. With both the conservative leadership of the army and Insulindian royalty feeling threatened by the prospect of socialist rule, any attempted overthrowal of the state was doomed to be ended at the hands of an armed putsch by either of these parties. The leadership of Murba however recognized the ally the president and his PNI formed, who also partially embraced socialist ideals. One visit later, and the president agreed to appoint Malaka as prime minister of Insulindia, while Tan promised to keep the institutions of Insulindia in place... For now."
 ins.6.a:0 "The conservatives aren't completely reassured however..."
 ins.7.t:0 "Rebellion in Yogyakarta"
 ins.7.d:0 "A socialist rebellion has erupted in the Yogyakarta province against its hereditary governor, sultan Hamengkubuwono IX. Starting in the countryside, the rebel band soon moved on to siege the city itself. The rebellion was quickly pacified through promises by the national government, but this is a clear sign that the local population doesn't approve of the earlier settlement in which the sultan retains a good part of their power as governor. The president is already considering revoking Yogyakarta's special status: if the population doesn't want the sultan to have this position, who are we to protect him?"
 ins.7.a:0 "Revoke Yogyakarta's special status!"
 ins.8.t:0 "The New Constitution"
 ins.8.d:0 "Insulindia has had two Constitutions so far: one written by Sukarno that doesn't meet the basic requirements to safeguard Insulindian democracy and one we were forced to replace the earlier with by our former Dutch overlords, one that for that fact alone no Insulindian would want to stand by. It is time for the newly elected Dewan, under the leadership of PPP, the largest party in it, to write a new constitution that both the average Insulindian will want to swear by and safeguards our democracy sufficiently."
 ins.8.a:0 "Article 1..."
 ins.9.t:0 "Position of the president"
 ins.9.d:0 "Previously the president has had quite substantial powers. The president is leading the PNI and thus isn't too friendly to our democratic rule and who knows who might come after him? The flip side of the coin however is that if we limit the position of the president, we risk losing support of the PNI, who we might need for the 2/3rd majority needed to institute the new constitution."
 ins.9.a:0 "Reduce the presidency to a purely ceremonial status."
 ins.9.b:0 "Make the president the guiding hand in the formation of coalitions."
 ins.9.c:0 "Allow the president to write decrees and veto bills."
 ins.10.t:0 "Election of the president"
 ins.10.d:0 "Previously, the president was elected by the dewan. This leads to significant complications however, for instance if a majority isn't reached. To counter this we could include in the new constitution that the party who claim the largest share of the vote in the election claim the presidency, which again might upset the PNI."
 ins.10.a:0 "The Dewan continues to elect the president."
 ins.10.b:0 "The president is directly elected by the people."
 ins.11.t:0 "Mandate of the Dewan"
 ins.11.d:0 "In the current constitution the length of the term of the Dewan is supposed to be 5 years. We could shorten this to 4 years to keep the participation in democracy of the common Insulindian higher and to make the election ever so slightly more direct."
 ins.11.a:0 "4 years."
 ins.11.b:0 "5 years."
 ins.12.t:0 "Position of religion"
 ins.12.d:0 "In the original constitutions the country was secular and not bound to one religion. Many in Nahdlatul Ulama don't approve of this and want to establish Islam as Insulindia's official state religion. This will likely put off Murba and the PSI from voting for the new constitution, and neither does the idea excite the PNI very much, so we better have given away enough to the PNI before or it will be highly unlikely for us to garner the votes for the needed 2/3rd majority."
 ins.12.a:0 "Remain secular."
 ins.12.b:0 "Establish Islam as our state religion."
 ins.12.c:0 "Codify Sharia law into the constitution."
 ins.13.t:0 "Constitution passes"
 ins.13.d:0 "We have successfully secured the voted required to overwrite the old constitution and our new permanent constitution has gone into effect. This is a great day for the Insulindian state, its democracy and its people."
 ins.13.a:0 "A toast to the new constitution!"
 ins.14.t:0 "Constitution fails"
 ins.14.d:0 "It appears we were unable to secure the required 2/3rd majority needed to overwrite the previous constitution; the bill has sadly been quashed and the future of the Nahdlatul Ulama government looks most uncertain as we made several important persons angry with this attempted change."
 ins.14.a:0 "I expected more of this..."
 ins.15.t:0 "A Presidential Decree"
 ins.15.d:0 "Following our government's failure to replace the constitution imposed on us by the Dutch, the president has issues a decree declaring that we return to the previous constitution. This clearly means that the largest share of the power has been transferred to the president and that the PNI has taken over at the cost if us."
 ins.15.a:0 "It was to be expected..."
 ins.16.t:0 "Autocoup: Successful arrest of the president"
 ins.16.d:0 "Today, the so-called silent revolution is silent no more: president [Root.GetLeader], while having been cooperative for a while, is ultimately an enemy of the Insulindian worker and farmer. Early in the morning the Milisi Murba successfully used their official position in the government to infiltrate the presidential palace and took him into custody. The autocoup will not fail thanks to him, but the question remains whether our forces elsewhere will be able to maintain control."
 ins.16.a:0 "A good start!"
 ins.17.t:0 "Autocoup: Arrest of the president fails"
 ins.17.d:0 "The Milisi Murba unit we've sent to arrest president [Root.GetLeader] failed in their endeavour, with the presidential guard denying them entrance, which resulted in a brawl. The result was the mobilisation of the Djakarta military, who immediately picked the side of the PNI regime. Soon after, the president could be heard around the country denouncing our actions and already our men outside the palace note being pushed back. It seems our autocoup failed before it even properly began."
 ins.17.a:0 "And thus Tan Malaka goes off to exile again..."
 ins.18.t:0 "Autocoup: Opposition vanquished"
 ins.18.d:0 "Having the element of surprise in our favour, and with the president, the leader of the armed forces sidelined, chaos ruled in the military. It didn't take long until several divisions already defected to our righteous side, with the remainder largely being either trapped or too disorganized to take up arms. Some reactionary forces tried to rally in Yogyakarta behind sultan Hamengkubuwono IX, but as he lost all his privileges previously, the alliance soon found itself outnumbered. Barring some small skirmishes there, our socialist forces have clearly gained the overhand!"
 ins.18.a:0 "Hurrah!"
 ins.19.t:0 "Autocoup: Opposition overruns us"
 ins.19.d:0 "While we successfully managed to remove the president from the equation, we have sadly concluded that the sultan of Yogyakarta has filled in his role, using his privileges as governor of Yogyakarta, and his connections with Insulindia's other royalty, who also feel threatened by the prospect of proletarian rule. Much of the military quickly abided by this, and as a result reorganized: while our supporters did manage to overrun them in several cases, they are overall quickly being pushed back. Our autocoup has clearly failed and the reactionaries under their sultan puppet have taken over."
 ins.19.a:0 "And thus Tan Malaka goes off to exile again..."
 ins.20.t:0 "Proclamation of the Nusantara Communes"
 ins.20.d:0 "Following our success in sweeping away the corrupt old regime of Insulindia, it is time to set up the true workers state: the Federation of Communes of the Nusantara Archipelago, Nusantara Communes in short. Tan Malaka will fill in the role of chairman of this new country, while in many ways the old cabinet remains where they were, if under new names for their departments. Since Tan Malaka is the chairman now, however, a new general secretary (a position formerly known as prime minister) will need to be appointed. This choice could establish a permanent ally for Murba."
 ins.20.a:0 "Semaun, champion of western-style syndicalism."
 ins.20.b:0 "Amir Sjarifuddin, the radical force in the PSI."
 ins.20.c:0 "Tan Malaka can easily be both chairman and general secretary."
 ins.21.t:0 "Corruption rises"
 ins.21.d:0 "We are sadly seeing an upwards trend of corruption: many jobs that previously were either very closely coordinated or only held by the Dutch, such as customs duties, have now been opened up to general Insulindian populace. Many of these are poor and uneducated, and gladly take those extra rupiahs in return for letting an eye or returning a small favour. This has negative effects on our economy and by extension, our country."
 ins.21.a:0 "Terrible!"
 ins.22.t:0 "Operation Kemenangan"
 ins.22.d:0 "The filthy Portuguese imperialists still occupy the east of the island of Timor, part of Insulindia by right. The Portuguese are much weaker than us and overwhelming the Portuguese forces on the island should be doable, if risky as it could escalate in a full-blown war with the entente."
 ins.22.a:0 "Send in the troops!"
 ins.23.t:0 "Insulindian troops violate our sovereignty"
 ins.23.d:0 "Insulindian forces have moved into our colony in Timor Leste. Several skirmishes have already happened and their intent seems clear: occupying it and wrestling it from our control. Sadly our hopes of being able to defend the island are very limited considering the size and the garrison, but perhaps we can hold them off with the support of our allies?"
 ins.23.a:0 "There is nothing we can do."
 ins.23.b:0 "Issue an ultimatum, they need to leave our territory!"
 ins.24.t:0 "Portugal caves"
 ins.24.d:0 "Recognizing the hopelessness of the situation, Portugal has issued only protests against our 'illegal' move on 'rightful colony'. It's clear they have accepted the truth, and Timor Leste is ours."
 ins.24.a:0 "Long live Insulindia!"
 ins.25.t:0 "Portuguese Ultimatum"
 ins.25.d:0 "The Portuguese have issued an ultimatum: we have 6 hours to leave their sovereign territory or they will consider it a declaration of war. Seeing as the entente supports Portugal, it might be a war we cannot win..."
 ins.25.a:0 "War it is, then!"
 ins.25.b:0 "Retreat back to west Timor immediately!"
 ins.26.t:0 "Defeat in Timor"
 ins.26.d:0 "Despite our hardened resistance, it seems we were unable to defend East Timor from the Insulindians. Continuing the war over the island, which isn't very valuable anyways, seems like an unrealistic option."
 ins.26.a:0 "We have no choice."
 ins.26.b:0 "We shall never abandon the Portuguese people of Timor!"
 ins.27.t:0 "Portugal surrenders"
 ins.27.d:0 "Following our successful takeover of the island, the Portuguese have caved in and surrendered the colony to us. This is a great victory for Insulindia, as well as for the poor oppressed people of East Timor!"
 ins.27.a:0 "Victory is ours!"
 ins.27.b:0 "Obviously, if we peace out with the entente, East Irian is ours too!"
 ins.27.c:0 "No peace until Insulindians march in Lisbon!"
 ins.28.t:0 "Insulindia demands Papua"
 ins.28.d:0 "We have been at war with Insulindia for a while now, and said war did not necessarily work out in our favour. With Insulindia controlling Papua, they decided to not merely accept just annexing Timor, but they demand control over Papua, or 'East Irian' as they call it, too."
 ins.28.a:0 "We have little choice."
 ins.28.b:0 "Nah mate, that's not how it works here!"
 ins.29.t:0 "Peace at last"
 ins.29.d:0 "With our demands fulfilled at last, a peace can be signed with the entente powers. It was a rough war, but well worth it, considering our gains in New Guinea as well as those in Timor!"
 ins.29.a:0 "Victory is ours indeed!"
 ins.30.t:0 "Australasia refuses"
 ins.30.d:0 "The stubborn Australasians are refusing to cede our rightful land in East Irian. It appears that peace talks have broken down."
 ins.30.a:0 "And thus the war continues."
 ins.31.t:0 "Australasia broke down the peace negotiations"
 ins.31.d:0 "Despite our willingness to sit on one table with the Insulindians, the Australasians are refusing to concede their holdings in New Guinea that are occupied by the Insulindians to them. As such, the war continues..."
 ins.31.a:0 "Oof!"
 ins.32.t:0 "The Fall of Australasia"
 ins.32.d:0 "Our war with Insulindia has clearly gone way too far: with Insulindia having taken control over Australasia, it appears like all our hopes to bring this war in the far east to good end has been lost."
 ins.32.a:0 "Surrender to the Insulindians."
 ins.32.b:0 "We will never surrender!"
 ins.33.t:0 "The Entente surrenders"
 ins.33.d:0 "With the Entente virtually disabled with our occupation of Australasia, the [From.GetAdjective] government has given up on defeating us. Australasia has fallen to our mercy and its colonies will most certainly be transferred to our country."
 ins.33.a:0 "Hurrah!"
 ins.34.t:0 "Defeat in Timor"
 ins.34.d:0 "Our plan to take over Timor has backfired badly: the Portuguese imperialist dogs have pushed us off our side of the island. Little choice remains but to offer a humiliating surrender of the rest of the island to the Portuguese, who, knowing that we'd come back when we regained strength, won't settle for less..."
 ins.34.a:0 "We knew this was the risk!"
 ins.34.b:0 "Never shall we abandon the people of Timor!"
 ins.35.t:0 "The Insulindians surrender"
 ins.35.d:0 "Following their inevitable failure to hold on to the island of Timor, the Insulindians have returned to us with their pride broken. They offer to concede west Timor to us in return for peace..."
 ins.35.a:0 "Sounds like a deal!"
 ins.35.b:0 "We will not settle for less than the total destruction of the Insulindian regime!"
 ins.36.t:0 "The Portuguese accept"
 ins.36.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the Portuguese have accepted the humiliating peace offer we've had to draft. It was the only way, sadly..."
 ins.36.a:0 "One day, we will be back!"
 ins.37.t:0 "Insulindia offers to buy Papua"
 ins.37.d:0 "The Insulindians have made an offer to pay 20% of their yearly worth in return for our possessions in Papua. While the land is worth relatively little, some take exception to the idea as the local population overwhelmingly rejects any notion of joining Insulindia."
 ins.37.a:0 "That sounds like a decent deal."
 ins.37.b:0 "We want twice that amount!"
 ins.37.c:0 "No thank you..."
 ins.38.t:0 "Australasia accepts"
 ins.38.d:0 "Australasia accepted our offer to buy their possessions on Papua. This is a great day for the Irianese population and Insulindia alike!"
 ins.38.a:0 "Hurrah!"
 ins.39.t:0 "Australasia wants a greater sum."
 ins.39.d:0 "The Insulindians have let us know that they are open to the idea, but that they do want us to pay twice the amount we originally offered; many a sceptic, knowing that the realistic value of the land is fairly limited."
 ins.39.a:0 "We'll take it!"
 ins.39.b:0 "No deal!"
 ins.40.t:0 "Insulindia accepts"
 ins.40.d:0 "The Insulindian authorities reacted positively to our request for a better bargain. It seems we have a deal and the transfer of sovereignty is being arranged."
 ins.40.a:0 "A good bargain!"
 ins.41.t:0 "Insulindia refuses"
 ins.41.d:0 "The Insulindian authorities decided that our land in Papua isn't nearly worth the price we're asking of them. They opted out; Papua will stay ours..."
 ins.41.a:0 "All's well that ends well."
 ins.42.t:0 "Australasia rejects our suggestion"
 ins.42.d:0 "The Australasians have rejected our suggestion to purchase the Papua, claiming that it would go against the wishes of the native population and thus can't be arranged."
 ins.42.a:0 "Those are lies..."
 ins.43.t:0 "Insulindia demands the rest of the Indies"
 ins.43.d:0 "During our negotiations with the Insulindian menace we negotiated continued control over parts of the west of Insulindia. Now they have come back, arguing that according to the treaty, this was to be renegotiated in time. We aren't particularly inclined to actually give the area to them, especially considering the fact that the locals don't really want to become part of Insulindia, but our military presence in the area may be insufficient to keep the Insulindians in check."
 ins.43.a:0 "We have little choice!"
 ins.43.b:0 "They can come and take it!"
 ins.44.t:0 "The Dutch agree!"
 ins.44.d:0 "The Dutch have seen our point, and recognizing how their limited military presence in the area is likely insufficient to keep the island safe from our forces, have agreed to transfer the sovereignty of their possessions to us."
 ins.44.a:0 "A wise choice!"
 ins.45.t:0 "The Dutch refuse!"
 ins.45.d:0 "The foolish Dutch imperialists have denied the people in the west their unification with their brethren in the east, arguing that they don't want to join us. We have no choice but to save them by force!"
 ins.45.a:0 "We are coming to save you!"
 ins.46.t:0 "We are defeated!"
 ins.46.d:0 "It has shown that we indeed were unable to maintain our hold over our possessions in Insulindia following the offensive of said nation. It seems we have little choice but to accept this fact."
 ins.46.a:0 "A sad state of affairs..."
 ins.46.b:0 "Never shall we give up!"
 ins.47.t:0 "We are defeated!"
 ins.47.d:0 "The Dutch defenses were significantly stronger than we'd anticipated prior. It seems we are unable to mount an effective offensive against them and there are even fears of a counterattack. A humiliating peace seems to be our fate."
 ins.47.a:0 "We have little choice..."
 ins.47.b:0 "We shall never give up!"
 ins.48.t:0 "The Dutch surrender!"
 ins.48.d:0 "The weak Dutch imperialists were easily defeated by the much stronger Insulindian army. The amount of celebration of their liberation remained a bit pale, however, but that's probably because they overestimated the Dutch and thought they might secure a counterattack."
 ins.48.a:0 "Long live Insulindia!"
 ins.49.t:0 "The Insulindians give up!"
 ins.49.d:0 "The Insulindians have given up on their hopes to take western New Guinea by force. They now offer to pay reparations, it seems we have won..."
 ins.49.a:0 "That's good!"
 ins.49.b:0 "We have the moral obligation to cleanse that corrupt regime!"
 ins.50.t:0 "The Dutch want to destroy our government!"
 ins.50.d:0 "The Dutch have decided that they want to destroy our 'corrupt' government over just accepting our reparations. They apparently 'feel responsible about allowing such an aggressive regime to take power in our former colony'."
 ins.50.a:0 "Is that so?"
 ins.51.t:0 "Defeat in New Guinea"

 ins.52.a:0 "Victory is ours!"

 ins.52.c:0 "No peace until the Insulindian military marches in Canberra!"
 ins.53.t:0 "Insulindia demands Timor"
 ins.53.d:0 "We have been at war with Insulindia for a while now, and said war did not necessarily work out in our favour. With Insulindia controlling Timor as well, they decided to not merely accept just annexing East Papua, but they demand control over Timor as well."

 ins.53.b:0 "Never shall we abandon our colony!"
 ins.54.t:0 "Peace at last"

 ins.54.a:0 "Victory is ours indeed!"
 ins.55.t:0 "Portugal refuses"
 ins.55.d:0 "The stubborn Portuguese are refusing to cede our rightful land in East Timor. It appears that peace talks have broken down."

 ins.56.t:0 "Portugal broke down the peace negotiations"
 ins.56.d:0 "Despite our willingness to sit on one table with the Insulindians, the Portuguese are refusing to concede their holdings in New Guinea that are occupied by the Insulindians to them. As such, the war continues..."

 ins.57.t:0 "Victory in New Guinea"
 ins.57.d:0 "The Insulindians apparently thought they'd easily be able to push us out of our colony in New Guinea, but how wrong they were!

 ins.58.t:0 "[AST.GetNameDefCap] demands our surrender"

 ins.70.d:0 "None of the parties elected to the Dewan has achieved a workable majority and a government will need to be formed through compromise. While it is clear the [INS.GetLeader] will make sure this government is to be led by the PNI, the question posed is whether they will work with the pro-religious Nahdlatul Ulama and Sarekat Islam groups, or rather with the pro-socialist Partai Sosialis Insulindia and Murba..."
 ins.70.a:0 "A coalition with the PSII and NU."
 ins.70.b:0 "A coalition with Murba and the PSI."
 ins.71.t:0 "Crisis in the coalition"
 ins.71.d:0 "Noone, in the PNI nor Nahdlatul Ulama or PSII, was particularly excited to form a government together, but the people had spoken and there was little choice left. Recently however, tensions between the Partai Nasional Insulindia and the Islamic parties have grown, as the earlier seeks to cement their power through the president as leader of this secular state and the latter seems mostly interested in securing Islam's position as state religion of Insulindia. These stance are almost impossible to unite and the coalition seems bound to collapse; president [Root.GetLeader] is considering a decree declaring the current constitution void and reverting to the previous constitution in which the president has near absolute power and to send the conservative ministers home as the PNI cements its absolute rule over the republic."
 ins.71.a:0 "[INS.GetLeader] decrees that we revert to the previous constitution."
 ins.71.b:0 "Do everything within your power to salvage the coalition!"
 ins.72.t:0 "Coalition-saving Successful!"
 ins.72.d:0 "Our bartering by conceding at key points that are of lesser importance has led to the successful salvaging of our coalition, it seems this coalition will fulfil its term."
 ins.72.a:0 "Good!"
 ins.73.t:0 "Coalition-saving Failed!"
 ins.73.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, relations between the three parties continued fall, and today Nahdlatul Ulama and Sarekat Islam ministers have resigned from their posts. From this political disposition, the president has no choice but to bring out this decree..."
 ins.73.a:0 "So be it..."
 ins.74.t:0 "The [GetDateText] Affair"
 ins.74.d:0 "On [GetDateText], several armed soldiers moved to the palace to demand the dissolution of the People's Representative Council.

 ins.78.t:0 "Dealing with Borobudur"
 ins.78.d:0 "Near Yogyakarta in Java, there is the Borobudur temple complex, used by Buddhist infidels and restored by the Dutch 2 decades ago. Obviously this is a stain on our nation and we can't leave it be to attract more infidels, so it'll have to be demolished. The only question is how?"
 ins.78.a:0 "Dynamite!"
 ins.78.b:0 "Sledgehammers!"
 ins.79.t:0 "Question of the capital"
 ins.79.d:0 "With the royalist takeover, voices have appeared arguing to officially change the capital of our great nation to the city of Yogyakarta, the capital of the Sultan's own sultanate, where his seat of power is located. Others argue that such a move would imply Yogyakartan dominance within the nation and that it would be better to leave Jakarta as the capital of our nation to show our impartiality."
 ins.79.a:0 "I don't care for impartiality."
 ins.79.b:0 "Jakarta seems the better choice."
 ins.80.t:0 "Centralisation or Decentralisation?"
 ins.80.d:0 "The power of the nobility has been safeguarded through the coup, but now they start bickering amongst themselves: the sultan of Yogyakarta and by extension of all of [INS.GetNameDef] would like to centralize all power in the national government, but his allies, the lesser nobles and other sultans, would much rather keep power decentralized, with them at the head of their own kingdom. Now the sultan is trying to push through his wish for a centralized Insulindia - will the other nobles be able to stop the most powerful amongst them all?"
 ins.80.a:0 "Sultan Hamengkubuwono secures his wish!"
 ins.80.b:0 "The nobles successfully block the move!"
 ins.81.t:0 "The Royal Constitution - succession"
 ins.81.d:0 "As we start drafting a definitive constitution for our glorious nation, the first most glaring issue is succession: what if our sultan dies? The sultan himself would prefer his son to inherit, but many of the other nobles don't agree at all and argue instead that the best solution would be letting them vote on who shall rise to the throne, so the most capable among them all will rule."
 ins.81.a:0 "Elective monarchy it is..."
 ins.81.b:0 "Implying that the heir to Yogyakarta isn't always the most capable..."
 ins.82.t:0 "The Royal Constitution - executive power"
 ins.82.d:0 "After several questions that were rather easy to agree upon, such as the status of religion (free) and syndicalism (banned), once again a contentious issue has resurfaced: where should the responsibility of executive power lie? According to sultan Hamengkubuwono, this should be with the nation's sultan: this very debate proves it, if we don't, any decision would be reduced to the current bickering while absolute rule by the sultan would ensure quick decisionmaking. Several princes however, disagree, arguing that this places too much power in the sultan at the cost of the other nobles."
 ins.82.a:0 "The council of princes should have the final say."
 ins.82.b:0 "The sultan should have the final say."
 ins.83.t:0 "The Royal Constitution - revocation of titles"
 ins.83.d:0 "Towards the end of the constitution the sultan mentioned that there should be a possibility to revoke the titles in case of extraordinary events. This makes the bulk of the nobility anxious for their position and noone really believes the sultan would be able to push this through. Then he makes concessions however: it requiring a 2/3rd majority approval in the council of princes."
 ins.83.a:0 "Revocation is not acceptable..."
 ins.83.b:0 "...unless a 2/3rd majority of the other nobles agree!"
 ins.84.t:0 "Signing the Constitution"
 ins.84.d:0 "After long weeks of negotiation, we have finally finished the constitution. The sultan is signing it as we speak, it is clear however that we perhaps gave too much power to the national sultan. The princes and raja's do not look particularly happy with the new constitution, pessimists might say they will not be particularly loyal to this government they feel like they're not completely part of."
 ins.84.a:0 "Hurrah! Ah... Come on guys, cheer along!"
 ins.85.t:0 "Signing the constitution"
 ins.85.d:0 "After long weeks of negotiation, we have finally finished the constitution. The sultan is signing it as we speak, although he hesitates. It's clear we've had to give in a lot to the demands of the lesser nobles, with the result that this constitution renders them disproportionately powerful compared to before. It will be harder to push through our will in this environment."
 ins.85.a:0 "H... Hurrah?"
 ins.86.t:0 "Signing the constitution"
 ins.86.d:0 "After long weeks of negotiation, we have finally finished the constitution. The sultan is signing it as we speak, and afterwards a feast begins. While every side had to give in some things, it's clear that the end result is rather satisfying for both sides."

 ### Decisions ###
 INS_silent_revolution_category:0 "Silent Revolution"
 INS_silent_revolution_category_desc:0 "Tan Malaka and the Partai Murba do not approve of the current form of government of Insulindia, but also realise that they will have to tread carefully. Having secured the majority in the elections, we are perfectly positioned to slowly solidify our control over the nation, until we can commit an autocoup without weakening the nation to the point where we will be ousted from power or provoke a foreign power from intervening."
 ins_secure_the_milisi_murba:0 "Make the Milisi Murba an official part of the government"
 ins_secure_the_milisi_murba_desc:0 "The Milisi Murba is a small defence organisation we established not long after securing our victory to help prevent reactionaries from ignoring the mandate of the people and taking power. They are relatively weak though: we should make them officially part of the government besides the police, the army, air force and the navy to ensure they will be capable of fulfilling their goal."
 ins_socialist_rebellion_yogya:0 "Instigate a Socialist Rebellion in the Yogyakarta Sultanate"
 ins_socialist_rebellion_yogya_desc:0 "The sultanate of Yogyakarta managed to blackmail the Insulindian government earlier with support to gain a special status within the republic, governing their own state as if it were a monarchy. We can't just revoke this status without public backlash however, so let us 'fabricate' a socialist rebellion in order to produce a casus for the revocation - obviously they aren't ruling their province in an altruistic way."
 INS_expansion_category:0 "Insulindian Expansion"
 INS_expansion_category_desc:0 "The current borders of [Root.GetNameDef] are imperialist construct: on virtually all sides of our country there are lands that are most definitely supposed to be part of the united [Root.GetAdjective] nation from ethnical, religious or geographical perspectives."
 ins_occupy_east_timor:0 "Occupy Timor Leste"
 ins_occupy_east_timor_desc:0 "The Portuguese imperialists have held Timor under their imperialist rule for far too long. We should invade this stain on the map and liberate the Insulindian populace from their Portuguese tyranny."
 ins_try_to_buy_southeast_irian:0 "Attempt to buy Australasian New Guinea"
 ins_try_to_buy_southeast_irian_desc:0 "Australasia isn't an enemy to be desired, but their holdings on the island of New Guinea are an unjust occupation. To avoid full-scale armed conflict we could try to entice them into a sale."
 ins_invade_australian_irian:0 "Attack South-East Irian"
 ins_invade_australian_irian_desc:0 "The Australasians are shamelessly oppressing the Papua population of East Irian. Let us liberate them with force!"
 ins_demand_west_irian:0 "Demand the leftovers of Dutch rule"
 ins_confront_the_german_menace:0 "Confront the German menace"
 ins_confront_the_german_menace_desc:0 "The Germans maintain the formerly British areas in Malaya and northern Borneo. This area being separated from Insulindia, being culturally very similar, is nothing more than shameless imperialist construct that ought to be rectified!"
 ins_invade_sarawak:0 "Invade Sarawak"
 ins_invade_sarawak_desc:0 "The tiny nation of Sarawak is plagued by improper rule. We should be gracious enough to intervene and incorporate them in our nation, with the local Malay population surely seeing us as liberators, right?"
