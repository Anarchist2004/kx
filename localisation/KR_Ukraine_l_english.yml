###Bio###
POLITICS_PAVLO_SKOROPADSKYI_DESC: "Pavlo Skoropadskyi, opportunist, Cossack, military officer, descendant of Ukrainian nobility, but above all - he is Hetman, leader of Ukraine, whose power depends only on Soim and the King.\n\nTracing his lineage back to the hetman of the 18th century Zaporozhian Army, Skoropadskyi rose through the ranks of the tsar’s military in a flash. During the Ukrainian Revolution, Pavlo Skoropadskyi became the chief organizer of the specially created Ukrainian Army Corps and numerous Cossack volunteer detachments that sought to fight the pro-Bolshevik militias. An ardent opponent of socialism, Skoropadskyi, along with his capitalist, landowner and military allies, began a conspiracy against the Ukrainian People’s Republic before overthrowing it on April 29, 1918. This could not have been accomplished without the Kaiser’s help, and to repay him, Skoropadskyi soon found himself in deep military and economic ties with Germany.\n\nOnly King Vasyl, who in the eyes of the hetman is seen only as a compromise imposed by the Austrians, resists. Anything deemed contrary to the national interest is strictly forbidden and brutally persecuted. With the weakness and powerlessness of Soim, there is only a faint illusion of democracy in Ukraine, but hatred for the Hetman’s autocracy grows among the court and a conspiracy matures..."
POLITICS_VASYL_DESC: "Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen is known to many as King Vasyl Vyshyvanyi. By many he is regarded as a symbol of foreign dominance, imposed on Ukraine as a result of a compromise between Germany and Austria. However, the others know, that Vasyl is fascinated by Ukrainian culture, he writes and speaks Ukrainian, and there is not a single argument, except for his origin, that he is not worthy of the throne of Ukraine. Even before he became Vasyl Vyshyvanyi, he received the nickname \"The Red Prince\" for his desire to improve the living conditions of the poor Ukrainian population of Galicia. In fact, among the few legal parties of Ukraine sitting in the Soim, it is Vasyl who is being put faith on. However, with a stagnant economy, a dysfunctional bureaucracy, and most of all, tension with the influential Hetman and his SHD, Vasyl struggles to maintain authority."
POLITICS_VASYL_PRESIDENT_DESC: "Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen is known to many as King Vasyl Vyshyvanyi. By many he is regarded as a symbol of foreign dominance, imposed on Ukraine as a result of a compromise between Germany and Austria. However, the others know, that Vasyl is fascinated by Ukrainian culture, he writes and speaks Ukrainian, and there is not a single argument, except for his origin, that he is not worthy of the throne of Ukraine.

In fact, among the few legal parties of Ukraine sitting in the Soim, it is Vasyl who is being put faith on. However, with a stagnant economy, a dysfunctional bureaucracy, and most of all, tension with the influential Hetman and his SHD, Vasyl struggles to maintain authority."
POLITICS_LEO_STEFAN_DESC: "King Leo Stefan von Habsburg-Lothringen, while ethnically Austrian, has been raised in the Ukrainian culture. While to some, Leo’s ascension is indicative of compromise between the Reichspakt and Ukraine, many lament the continued dominance of Ukraine by foreigners. The real compromise, these dissidents claim, was between Germany and Austria, who are now united in support for Leo. Domestically much of Leo’s support comes from the powerful land-owning class who now control the Soim and who see the young king as little more than a puppet to illicit Austro-German support for their endeavours."
POLITICS_LEV_II_DESC: "Count Leo Stefan was born to the Habsburg-Lorraine family on June 12, 1928. Being groomed to potentially succeed to the throne of a Eastern European state, Leo ended up gaining a lot of knowledge and respect for Ukrainian customs. Eventually he would be raised to this position as Lev III once King Vasyl was killed by a communist, he now tries his best to represent Ukraine. This knowledge and actual attempt to help Ukraine was noticed by some socialists who wished to keep the stability of the crown yet bring forth leftist ideals. Being entangled within these ideals, Lev the II now reigns Ukraine as the People’s King, representing and supporting their struggles against those that would keep the peasantry, and wider Ukraine down."
POLITICS_DANIIL_I_DESC: "Danylo Skoropadskyi, son of the famous 'Hetman', has ascended to the Ukrainian throne. With the long power-struggle between the Hetman and the monarchy finally resolved, Ukraine breathes a sign of relief. Danylo however is quite rightly seen by many as little more than a puppet king, effectively allowing his father to the bulk of rulership while he himself acts as the front-man. Perhaps after Pavlo Skoropadskyi’s death will the young king finally be able to assert himself but for now the young king will do just as he is told."
POLITICS_MIKHAIL_BULGAKOV_DESC: "Mikhail Bulgakov, an ethnic Russian born in the Kyiv governate, was for much of his life known more so for his prolific writings and literary talents rather than politics. After finding himself heading up the russophile ViN organisation, he is now in charge of the government and has made his intentions clear that the so-called 'Free State of Ukraine' is little more than a temporary fixture until the nation can be annexed into the motherland once more."
POLITICS_DMITRI_DONTSOV_DESC: "Dmytro Dontsov has been are the forefront of Ukrainian nationalism for many years and has solidified his position as the primary nationalist ideologue in Ukraine. Having allied with Konovalets and his UVO, Dontsov has become powerful during the interwar and now finally ascended to a position of leadership with his intentions of driving out both German and Russian influences as well as a general crackdown against socialist activity."
POLITICS_YEVHEN_KONOVALETS_DESC: "Yevhen Konovalets is the recognizable leader of the Ukrainian nationalist movement and its prime military-political organization, the UVO. His biography is the history of Ukrainian Independence, its struggle for national identity and sovereignity.\n\nBorn in the village near Lemberg, Austria-Hungary, Konovalets was always connected to the Ukrainian national movement. In the pre-Weltkrieg years he became an active member of the Prosvita becoming the secretary of the Lemberg Department, the Ukrainian educational association, In 1913 he met Dmytro Dontsov and became greatly influenced by the nationalist ideology and rhetoric. \n\nConscripted to the Austro-Hungarian Army during the war, he became prisoner-of-war in Russia, where he joined a group of former Galician officers together with Andrii Melnyk, eventually fleeing to Kyiv together. Serving for the independent Ukrainian Republic, he organized the division of Sich Striltsi and later assumed its command, effectively suppressing the Bolshevik uprising in Kyiv and resisting the Communist offensive.\n\nHe soon became the Colonel of Army and the Sich Striltsi regiment of Konovalets were considered one of the most combat-ready units of the Ukrainian army.\n\nEverything changed when the Hetmanate has risen. The regiment was disarmed and disbanded at the request of German command only to Konovalets receiving permission from Hetman Skoropadskyi to form a separate detachment of Sich Striltsi as part of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian state in Bila Tserkva a few months later. The command of the created unit was opposed to the Hetman, but remained faithful to the oath given to the Hetman.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Konovalets, together with Andrii Melnyk and Dmytro Dontsov formed the UVO - a nationalistic organisation, which proclaimed its goal to create a conciliar independent Ukrainian state on ethnic Ukrainian lands with a supreme leader, Konovalets, as its head."
POLITICS_VYACHESLAV_LYPYNSKY_DESC: "Viacheslav Lypynskyi is known to be the main ideologue of the new Ukrainian statehood, the Hetman Movement, the Ukrainian Conservatism, or as he called it himself, the 'theory of Ukrainian Hetman Nationalism'. Despite this, he is a staunch critic of the Hetmanate, as he confronts Skoropadskyi’s desire to become the absolute monarch of Ukraine, as well as he sharply criticizes the radical 'integral nationalism' of Dontsov.\n\nBeing leader of the USKhD, a party once created to support the Hetman, Lypynskyi is soon to find himself among the other oppositional parties and main enemies of the Hetmanate regime."
POLITICS_OLEKSANDR_SHAPOVAL_DESC: "Not much known about Oleksandr Shapoval. Born in Poltava Governorate in a family of peasants, Oleksandr rose, as many did, with the help of army service. In 1917 he became the commander of the 1st Cossack regiment named after Bohdan Khmelnitskyi, the first Ukrainian unit in the Russian Army, later better known as Bohdanivtsi. That is when he became acquainted with Petro Bolbochan and became involved in the activities of the UPSS. First a supporter of the Hetman, Shapoval later found himself in the opposition - together with the USKhD. Being a representative of a conservative wing of the UPSS, Shapoval is looking forward to establish a conservative regime, either with a strong presidential power, or under the command of Vasyl Vyshyvanyi."
POLITICS_OLEKSANDR_HREKIV_DESC: "Born in the noble family near Sumy, Oleksandr Hrekiv lived a life of a typical member of the Russian gentry. According to family tradition, his ancestors were Greeks and the founder was thought to be Logophetos, a courtier of Tsarevna Sophia Palaeologus, who came to Moscow in 1472 along with her court.\nGraduated from Moscow University with the Law Degree in 1897, Oleksandr decided to tie his life with the military service, serving in the grenadier and guardian regiments of the Imperial Russian Army. He also taught political and military history in St. Petersburg until the Weltkrieg.\nIn 1917 he identified himself as Ukrainian and was the head of the garrison and then Deputy Minister of War. After the Hetman came to power, Hrekiv established and headed the Ukrainian Military Society \"Batkivschyna\", closely connected with the UPSS. Batkivschyna was focused to bring together the military officers and leaders, that opposed the Hetmanist government. While he is considered a supporter of Petliura, he served as the Chief of General Staff in Skoropadskyi's Army from October 1918 to 1921, and participated in the Army Reform. It is largely Hrekiv's merit that Skoropadskyi managed to build up a professional army. However, it was dangerous for Skoropadskyi to keep Hrekiv at such a high position. He was almost arrested for false accusations in official embezzlement, but due to Austrian mediation he was sent to train officers of the Ukrainian Galician Army in Galicia-Lodomeria. It was not until 1930, when he returned to Ukraine at the invitation of King Vasyl, his acquaintance, despite Hrekiv never supported his claims and even opposed them.\nNow, as the leader of free Ukraine, Hrekiv is seeking to fulfill the requirements for Ukrainian true independence - and the first and foremost, the strong and disciplined army."
POLITICS_ANDRIY_MELNYK_DESC: "Andriy Melnyk, colonel of the Army of the Ukrainian People’s Republic, one of the closest associates of Yevhen Konovalets, as well as one of the organizers of the Ukrainian Military Organization. Since the late 1920s, by order of Konovalets, he was in Galicia, where he represented the UVO, engaged in propaganda of Ukrainian nationalism and distributed anti-Austrian and anti-Polish leaflets.\n\nA staunch nationalist, proponent of the Ukrainian Natiocracy, Melnyk is seen as less radical than Dontsov and Konovalets, focusing more on militarism and centralisation, than on fierce radical nationalism."
POLITICS_DMYTRO_DOROSHENKO_DESC: "For Hetman - Doroshenko is a loyal subject, for nationalists - a liberal, and for the Central Committee of the UPR in exile - he is a traitor. \n\nOnce a member of the UPSF, shortly after Hetman Skoropadskyi came to power, Doroshenko became one of the leaders of the Hetman movement, Minister of Foreign Affairs and the main representative of the interests of the national democratic forces. Having created the USKhD together with Lypynskyi, Doroshenko was expelled from the party by the end of the 1920s. This was due to the ideological split between Lypynskyi and the Hetman. Doroshenko re-established the UPSF, as the left wing of the party renamed itself to the ULD(S-F), and remained one of the few supporters of Skoropadskyi, although he held more democratic views. Perhaps one day, he will be able to implement them without conflicting with the interests of the Hetman."
POLITICS_DMYTRO_LEVYTSKY_DESC: "Dmytro Levytskyi was born in the Lemberg region of Austria-Hungary, in 1877. He completed law school at the University of Vienna and during Weltkrieg served as an officer in the army of Austria-Hungary. Captured by the Russians in 1915, he spent the remainder of the war in Tashkent. Returning to Ukraine as the Russian Empire fell apart, Levytskyi hoped that the Austria-Hungary will fell, finally allowing for the West Ukrainians to unite with the rest of the country. Unfortunately, it did not happen. Forced to exile, as many democratic leaders, Levytskyi soon established the UNDO together with Mikhnovskyi, becoming his only ally.\n\nNow, when the UNDO finally stays triumphant in the mainland Ukraine, Levytskyi will do all his best to create a constitutional democratic republic with strong national identity."
POLITICS_MYKOLA_MIKHHNOVSKY_DESC: "'Mykola Mikhnovskyi is a Ukrainian elemental force,... which is restrained only by a strong and noble mind. He was a highly educated and experienced lawyer, a subtle psychologist, a successful initiator, an outstanding organizer, a brilliant speaker, a talented publicist, an intelligent and tactful leader, an intuitive military commander, an excellent connoisseur of our past, our history and everyday life, a typical revolutionary, that is, a person capable of decisive action. Brought up in good Ukrainian traditions, raised in a Ukrainian village, Mykola Mikhnovskyi was a model of Ukrainian racial culture, a Ukrainian aristocrat in all meanings of this concept.' - is the most flattering description of Mykola Mikhnovskyi.\n\nIn fact, the reality is somewhat different. All his life Mikhnovskyi defended ideas that were not supported by the majority. He has gained a strong reputation as a complex person with whom it is difficult to communicate. Extreme demands narrowed the circle of his friends: only those who shared his views became close.\n\nAn opponent of the policy of the Central Rada, a supporter of Skoropadskyi’s coup, Mikhnovskyi, unfortunately, turned out to be on the other side of the barricades against his will.\n\nDespite the negative reviews, the Hetman seriously considered Mikhnovskyi as a candidate for the post of Prime Minister of the Ukrainian State. He was impressed by anti-socialist views and his recognition of the right of peasants to private ownership of land. However, Pavlo Skoropadskyi was eventually persuaded not to appoint Mikhnovskyi as prime minister, and he offered him the position of his personal adviser. The ambitious Mikhnovskyi, of course, refused this, which foretold his future fate.\n\nMykola Mikhnovskyi made a lot of efforts to transform the Hetman’s political regime into a truly popular Ukrainian government. He was the author of a series of documents criticizing the composition of the government and its policies, subordinated directly to the Hetman. Mikhnovskyi was part of the delegations that appealed to the German occupation authorities. Not trusting the socialists, Mikhnovskyi did not support the idea of a mass anti-Hetman uprising. In the end, all his attempts led to the fact that he was expelled from Ukraine to Kuban, where he became a professor in Katerynodar Cooperative University, without losing hope of returning to Kyiv."
POLITICS_SERHIY_YEFREMOV_DESC: "Serhiy Yefremov was born into a priestly family and studied at the Kyiv Theological Seminary, which, however, did not prevent him from engaging in active political and educational activities. In 1911 he became one of the 82 famous writers and public figures who signed the protest \"to the Russian society about the bloody slander of the Jews\" published in connection with the \"case of Beilis\" Having become a staunch opponent of xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and Ukrainophobia, he was repeatedly arrested by the imperial authorities. It was he who suggested the use of the name Ukrainian People’s Republic for the state that emerged in Kyiv and thus became the \"godfather\" of the UNR.\n\nIn September 1917 he headed the Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists.\nAfter Skoropadskyi came to power, he criticized him and perceived it as usurpation of power and revenge of pre-revolutionary reaction. He was soon forced to flee to Galicia, where he joined the Dyrektoria and became one of its prominent right-wing leaders.\n\nNow in power, the Socialist-Federalists would finally be able to pursue their policy, liberal and moderate, despite the name, which was rather a tribute to the times."
POLITICS_ANDRIY_NIKOVSKYI_DESC: "Andriy Nikovskyi came from a family of peasants and petty bourgeoisie in Kherson province. He studied at the University of Novorossiysk, first at the Natural Sciences Department, then at the Slavonic-Russian Department of History and Philology. After graduation, he worked for one year as a teacher of Russian language and literature, but soon left for Kyiv to work as an editor of the newspaper \"Rada\". He was also the secretary of the \"Prosvita\" in Odesa.\n\nAfter the Hetman came to power, he participated in the creation of the Ukrainian National Union, which was preparing a coup against Skoropadskyi and became its first head. However, in September he was replaced by Volodymyr Vynnychenko, after which the UNS turned into the Dyrektoria.\n\nNikovskyi collaborated with Serhiy Yefremov and worked with him in the Kyiv newspaper Rada. In exile in Galicia he became one of the leaders of the ULD(S-F)."
POLITICS_OLEKSANDER_SHULHYN_DESC: "Born in Poltava Region, coming from the elder Cossack family, related to the Polubotky, the Skoropadskyi and the Apostol families, Oleksandr Shulhyn is a socio-political activist, one of the leaders of the Ukrainian Liberal-Democrats. During his short political career in the early days of the Ukrainian People's Republic, Shulhyn managed to serve as general secretary of international affairs, co-authored the Statute of the Supreme Administration of Ukraine and co-organized the Congress of the Enslaved Peoples of Russia. During his short, but successful foreign policy leadership, Ukraine was de-facto recognized by Britain and France and de-jure - by Central Powers.\n\nIn exile, Shulhyn headed the Extraordinary Diplomatic Mission of the Ukrainian People's Republic in the United Kingdom, which however ended with the British Revolution. Becoming an author of reports on the history of Ukrainian statehood and the activities of the UNR government-in-exile, he continuously criticized the Hetmanate regime and managed to be elected as the nation's prime-minister with the landslide victory of ULD(S-F). Being a skillful diplomat and master in foreign affairs, Shulhyn is looking forward to securing Ukraine's position in the world and establishing it as a leading democratic power in Eastern Europe."
POLITICS_VSEVOLOD_HOLUBOVYCH_DESC: "The youngest Ukrainian prime minister in history became head of government shortly before his 33rd birthday. Fellow politicians did not speak of him in the best words. A Scoundrel is a common word addressed to the Ukrainian Prime Minister in 1918.\n\nHe was no stranger to politics. He participated in the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party and even received administrative penalties in 1905.\n\nSince 1912 he joined the circle of Ukrainian SRs. In 1915 he went to work for the railroad. In 1916, he moved to the position of head of the department of water, highway and dirt roads of the Romanian Front. There he built roads for the military. Probably, at this time he was not up to political pursuits.\n\nThe revolution of 1917 opened up new opportunities. He was eagerly invited to join the revived Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries. More and more often he was seen at pro–Ukrainian events in the city - rallies and meetings. He created an Odesa department of the UPSR amongst the railway workers of the Odesa railway network and soon was elected as the head of the Odesa City Council. Quickly rising in ranks, Holubovych soon found himself as the head of Ukrainian Government after the poor management of the Vynnychenko’s government. He also headed the Ukrainian delegation to Brest-Litovsk, after which he returned triumphant, but soon became the main culprit of the Austro-German occupation of Ukraine and a German-backed coup of Hetman Skoropadskyi. On April 29, 1918, he was arrested by the Germans for his participation in the kidnapping of the pro-German banker A. Dobry. In 1919, a German military court sentenced Holubovych to 2 years in prison.\n\nAfter his release in 1921 he left Ukraine for Galicia, where he joined the Dyrektoria. However, his reputation stayed with him, despite his prison sentence, and if elected once again, it is likely that much pressure and suspicion would be put on him."
POLITICS_LEVKO_KOVALIV_DESC: "Levko Kovaliv became one of the leaders of the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries and member of the Central Committee of the party in 1917. In 1918, together with Oleksandr Shumskyi, Panas Liubchenko and others, he joined the left fraction of the party, which soon became known as Borotbysts. During the Hetmanate, he headed the work of underground counter-intelligence. The struggle of the revolutionary forces against the Hetman's power was a significant destabilizing force, which hindered Hetmanate's ability to act according to their own plans. Unfortunately, not a single political party was able to organize a large-scale anti-Hetman uprising at that time due to the lack of an all-Ukrainian revolutionary and political center. Borotbysts failed to take the peasant uprising into their own hands. Soon enough all socialist-minded politicians in Ukraine were forced to exile by the Skoropadskyi’s Derzhavna Varta and German forces.\n\nIn emigration, he diverged in views with Oleksandr Shumskyi, leader of the Borotbysts, who refused cooperation with other socialist parties and insisted on continuing the revolutionary struggle against the Hetman regime. Instead, Kovaliv, believed that cooperation with other socialist parties is a necessary step to overthrow the Hetman. On this basis, he returned to the UPSR, where he headed the left faction and promoted pro-Borotbyst views among the party members.\n\nNow, elected as party head, there are even fewer contradictions between the two parties and their unification is closer than ever."
POLITICS_MYKOLA_KOVALEVSKYI_DESC: "Mykola Kovalevskyi joined the Kyiv Committee of Ukrainian SRs in 1914. He co-authored the project of the party program, participated in the preparation of a protest demonstration against the Tsar's ban on celebrating the 100th anniversary of T. Shevchenko's birthday and later worked in a cooperative in Poltava.\n\nIn 1917 he became an active participant in Ukrainian revolution - as a member of the Ukrainian Central Rada and member of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Selianska Spilka. He also served as the Minister of Land Affairs\n\nIn 1920 he was forced into emigration. At first he lived in Vienna, but soon moved to Galicia in order to join Dyrektoria, where he became the most likely candidate for the Minister of Land Affairs.\n\nNow, elected as the new Prime Minister, Kovalevskyi will focus on the final resolution of the land issue in Ukraine."
POLITICS_PAVLO_KHRISTIUK_DESC: "Born in a Kuban Cossack family, Pavlo Khristiuk, has become actively involved in political life when he was just 22. He became a proponent of Ukrainian cultural development and tried his best to achieve it as far as possible. Among others, he signed a letter addressed to a member of the Russian Imperial State Duma, which reflected the well-founded anxiety of the Ukrainian intelligentsia, caused by constant and purposeful Russification policy of the tsarist government.\nLater joining the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party, he became a leading member of its Central Committee and the Selianska Spilka and a minister of internal affairs in the government of Vsevolod Holubovych in 1918.\n\nIn 1919, among other Ukrainian SR members, he emigrated to Vienna, where he stayed for some time and worker as an co-editor of the 'Boritesia - Poborete' magazine. He later went to Lviv, where he actively hepled the local cooperative movement, combining it with his work in the Dyrektoria.\n\nNow, elected as the Ukrainian head of state, Khristiuk is willing to make Ukraine a truly people's republic with strong national identity and healthy and happy nation."
POLITICS_MYKYTA_SHAPOVAL_DESC: "Mykyta Shapoval is not just a politician. Known as a publicist, sociologist, a poet, and even as a forester by his profession, Shapoval became one of the leaders of the 'centrist faction' in the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary party in exile. Unlike the other Dyrektoria members, he spent much of the recent years in Prague, where he became well-known as an organizer of the All-Ukrainian Workers' Union of Bohemia, co-creator of Ukrainian higher schools in Prague and head of the Ukrainian Sociological Institute in Prague, thanks to the support of T.Masaryk.\n\nIn his own party he is well known to be a socialist demagogue and a populist. Whether his 'presidency' will show any tangible results is yet to be seen."
POLITICS_MYKHAILO_HRUSHEVSKYI_DESC: "On November 7, 1918, the chairman of the Ukrainian Central Rada, Mykhailo Hrushevskyi, has proclaimed the Ukrainian People's Republic...\n\nJust a few months before, a well-known Ukrainian historian, author of the ten-volume monograph \"History of Ukraine-Rus\", which caused a great deal of acute scientific disputes and demagoguery, Mykhailo Hrushevskyi had been elected the chairman of Rada.\nHrushevskyi, a liberal democrat before the Revolution, soon made the Ukrainian SRs his main support and began to fulfill the cardinal political task of his movement - the formation of national statehood, initially in the form of national—territorial autonomy of Ukraine in Russia, which was later supposed to be transformed into a treaty federation. However, everything changed soon - or even too soon. With the Bolshevik revolution in Russia - Ukraine first declared its independence, just to became a German protectorate a few months later.\n\nIn 1919 Hrushevskyi left for Austria and established Ukrainian Sociological Institute in Vienna, distancing himself from the Dyrektoria's political intrigues. Nevertheless, he stayed as an active member of the Ukrainian SR Party, and with People's Republics flags waving over Kyiv, he was invited to lead the Ukrainian government once again."
POLITICS_CENTRAL_RADA_DESC: "Ukrainian Law says that if the office of the Prime-Minister is vacant, the Ukrainian Parliament becomes a collective executive institution until the new government is appointed."
POLITICS_YEVHEN_PETRUSHEVYCH_DESC: "Yevhen Petrushevych is a real mastodon in Western Ukrainian politics. He was a talented organizer of socio-political and cultural-educational life in Eastern Galicia, chairman of the district "Prosvita" and a fighter against "Muscovophilia", widespread in the Sokal region in those years. He won the favor of the broad masses by his professional defense against the arbitrariness of the authorities as a lawyer.\nIn the first elections to the Austrian parliament in 1907 he became ambassador for a large constituency in Eastern Galicia. Among the 30 Ukrainian deputies he became one of the leaders, the chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary representation, whose speeches at the sessions were distinguished by purposefulness and deep argumentation. He did not hesitate to criticize the policy of the Austrian government in the national question and insistently demanded reforms, first of all in the electoral sphere. Thanks to Petrushevych’s activities, Ukrainians became more involved in leadership positions in local and regional institutions, and he even achieved the appointment of Ukrainians to leadership positions in the Austrian government. \n\nTogether with parliamentarians from the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Petrushevych worked out and submitted to Emperor Charles a plan for restructuring the Austro-Hungarian Empire, transforming it into a federation of free nations with the prospect of forming national states in alliance with Austria, which soon happened, though partially.\nDuring the last 16 years after the war, Petrushevych achieved the creation of the Ukrainian Galician Army as a unit of the Austrian armed forces, as well as the favor of the emperor on the issue of the UNR government in exile in Galicia. However, the Ukrainians never received the promise of broad autonomy, which significantly undermined confidence in the Austrians.\n\nNow, having proclaimed the sovereignty of the Western Ukrainian People’s Republic, there is no doubt that, under Petrushevych’s leadership, these lands will finally reunite with their brothers in Kyiv."
POLITICS_SYMON_PETLIURA_DESC: "A native of Poltava, Symon Petliura, is known as an impulsive person, prone to noisy effects, yet pragmatic and rational. A member of USDRP, rather socialist-minded politician became the first military minister of the Ukrainian People’s Republic, the creator of the first national armed forces of Ukraine. Unlike his fellow party member Vynnychenko, Petliura believed that only a professional regular army will help to win Ukrainian independence. With his special regiment of Haidamaks, Petliura played a major role in suppressing the 'Arsenal' industrial plant and liquidation of last remnants of Bolshevik uprising.\n\nAfter the Hetman’s Coup, Petliura together with other social-democrats began to establish shadow structures of opposition across the country, preparing an armed uprising against Skoropadskyi. But as most socialist leaders were arrested or exiled, the uprising never happened and Petliura was forced to flee to Galicia-Lodomeria.\n\nBeing one of the leaders of the exiled forces, Petliura patiently waits for the right moment for a coup. But should the socialists once again turn against Ukrainians, Petliura can use his connections in the army for his own good."
POLITICS_ISAAK_MAZEPA_DESC: "Isaak Mazepa was born into a petty bourgeois family of Cossack origin. His father ensured his son's education in the theological seminary in Chernihiv. After graduating from seminary, he enrolled at the Faculty of Natural Sciences at St. Petersburg University. In St. Petersburg fate brought him together with Mykola Porsh and Symon Petliura,. Soon he joined the USDRP, of which he later became one of the leaders.\n\nAfter the formation of the Ukrainian Central Rada, Isaak did much to develop the activities of Ukrainian parties and organizations in Yekaterinoslav province. During the Hetmanate, when the persecution of active Ukrainian movement members began in Yekaterinoslav, Mazepa, working in the provincial zemstvo council, tried to protect them. In October 1918, Mazepa was arrested for editing a social-democratic newspaper and soon was fired. With the formation of the Dyrektoria as the government of the UPR in exile, Mazepa went to Galicia, where he was elected to the Central Committee of the USDRP and became its secretary. \n\nAfter Otaman Petliura's coup, he joined the Ukrainian National Union, which he created, where, along with Mykyta Shapoval, he led a leftist faction. Now at the head of the country, Mazepa was ready to change the country further in the vein of socialist democracy."
POLITICS_VOLODYMYR_VYNNYCHENKO_DESC: "Volodymyr Vynnychenko is considered by many as a founding father of Ukrainian statehood, together with Mykhailo Hrushevskyi. An author of almost all official declarations and legislation of the Ukrainian People’s Republic, he also became the first prime-minister of this formally sovereign short-lived state.\n\nAfter the Hetman’s Coup, he was arrested by the new government for trumped-up charges. in the preparation of a coup d'etat. However, the German administration pressured Skoropadskyi to liberate him, frightened by the possibility of political destabilisation. He became the leader of the alliance of Ukrainian socialist parties, planning to organize an armed uprising against Skoropadskyi’s dictatorship with the help of Russian Bolsheviks. However, his plans were doomed to failure, and, miraculously avoiding another arrest, together with other former UPR leaders, Vynnychenko fled to Galicia and headed the UPR government in exile.\n\nAlong with Symon Petliura, he is one of the leaders of the upcoming uprising against the Hetman regime, but will he be able to hold off another attempt to create a socialist republic in Ukraine?"
POLITICS_VASYL_SHAKHRAI_DESC: "Called a \"national communist\" by his rivals, he is one of the main communist theorists of the Ukrainian national struggle. Speaking out against both nationalism and capitalism, Shakhrai fights for workers' power in Ukraine, unconstrained by imperialism and opportunistic compromises. Having a friendly relationship with Shumskyi, Shakhrai is the only person who can unite the left flank of Ukrainian politics."
POLITICS_IVAN_BAHRIANYI_DESC: ""
POLITICS_IVAN_MAISTRENKO_DESC: "Born in 1899 in the small Ukrainian town of Opyshnya, Poltava region, Ivan Maistrenko, dreaming of a Ukraine without tsarism and exploitation, actively participated in anti-Tsarist student societies, having his first experience of organizing and illegal work. This experience came in handy when the revolution began.\nJoining the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries in 1917, the young Maistrenko became firmly associated with its radical left wing, soon to be called \"Borotba\". \n\nWhen the Germans came, he fought with small units of the UNR army and Borotba partisans against the Hetman government until he became disillusioned with the possibility of a popular uprising against the Hetman government, as the German army suppressed any dissatisfied leftist forces and peasant uprisings. He made a difficult decision and moved to Galicia, a Ukrainian region, to continue the struggle in another way.\n\nSeeing the unwillingness of the policy of the Dyrektoria to organize effective political agitation in Austrian Ukraine and not supporting the right-wing and authoritarian tendencies of Petrushevych, Maistrenko and a small group of Borotbysts and Communists, joined by the left-liberal Ivan Bahrianyi and the democratic nationalist group of Petro Poltava, set out to create a strong Ukrainian leftist party that would promote Ukrainian politics in Galicia as well as in central Ukraine with the goal of uniting it into a prosperous and democratic state\n\nHowever, the creation of such a party was by no means smooth. From its inception, the URDP was split almost in half by the left wing of Maistrenko and the right wing of Bagryanyi, who worked side by side as autonomous groups, in a party that was more like an electoral coalition than a unified political entity. \n\nRepresenting the left wing of the URDP, Maistrenko was editor of the socialist magazine Vpered, where he advocated a socialist system based on market redistribution rather than central planning. While writing that the market was necessary to guard against authoritarianism, he still insisted on full socialization of the means of production and strict regulation to create a just, socialist, and democratic society for Ukraine.\n\nWith his wing of the URDP in power, Maistrenko would do anything to move Ukraine toward his vision of a truly socialist, unified, democratic republic..."

He headed one of the Serdyk divisions of Petliura.\nAfter Skoropadskyi's Coup, Hrekiv joined the opposition to Hetman's regime and headed the Ukrainian Military Society \"Batkivschyna\", that seeked to unite all oppositional pro-Ukrainian officers. While he is considered a supporter of Petliura, he served as the Chief of General Staff in Skoropadskyi's Army from October 1918 to 1921, and participated in the Army Reform. It is largely Hrekiv's merit that Skoropadskyi managed to build up a professional army. However, it was dangerous for Skoropadskyi to keep Hrekiv at such a high position. He was almost arrested for false accusations in official embezzlement, but due to Austrian mediation he was sent to train officers of the Ukrainian Galician Army in Galicia-Lodomeria. It was not until 1930, when he returned to Ukraine at the invitation of King Vasyl, his acquaintance, despite Hrekiv never supported his claims.\nNow, serving as a field general for Ukraine, Hrekiv is still seen as a dangerous element with hidden sympathies to Skoropadskyi and most of the Russophiles in the government and General Staff.§!"

After graduating from the gymnasium, he entered the Philosophy Faculty of Lviv University.\nIn the fall of 1911, he initiated and was the first to implement the idea of a Ukrainian Scout military organisation. Chmola's Plast group, along with the groups of Oleksandr Tysovskyi and Petro Franko became one of the three groups that have established the Plast - Ukrainian national scout organisation. The task of the scout organisation was the military education and training of Ukrainian youth for the future armed struggle for an independent Ukraine.\nIn 1914 he was elected the head of the student Striltsi organization, organized military exercizes and educational events, compiled the first military textbooks and created military terminology. Within a few days of the Weltkrieg, a Striltsi mobilization committee was created in Lviv, which organized the first combat hundred of the Ukrainian Sich Striltsi, under the command of centurion Chmola. Unfortunately, he was captured by the Russians in the very beginning of the Weltkrieg, spending the rect of the war in Russian concentration camps.\nAfter the February Revolution in Russia, he managed to escape to Ukraine together with Yevhen Konovalets and Andriy Melnyk.

Since 1927 in his camp both boys and girls shifts were spent, about 100-200 scouts yeach.

The party was an amalgamation of the Mikhnovskyi’s UNP, military officials, and formerly members of the UPSR and USDRP, who disagreed with the autonomist calls of the Central Rada. When the revolution collapsed and the Hetman rule was established, at first glance the question of independence fell away. But Ukraine was becoming increasingly dependent and controlled by Germany and Austria, and Imperial Russian officials from Protofis and the Union of Landlords still had great influence over Ukraine. Poles, Germans, and Russians exploited the Ukrainian peasants and ruled the land, while workers were repressed. Most party members returned to the parties most suited to them as they adopted an independent platform, joining either the Hetman or the Directory. With the Hetman's passivity in solving national and social problems and the departure of the old guard, the party successfully found a new identity for itself in the form of social patriotism - socialism and radical civic nationalism became the basis for the party. In 1934, a new party program was adopted, inspired by Mikhnovskyi’s early writings.

However, with little hope for the loyalty of the peasantry, the hetman turned to another source of replenishing his army, namely foreign mercenaries. In contrast to civil war-torn Russia, Ukraine was securely protected by Austro-Hungarian and German bayonets and was a real oasis of tranquility, which attracted a great number of officers of the former Tsarist army who formed officer volunteer detachments with a very skeptical, and sometimes hostile, attitude toward Ukrainian statehood. It was only by the end of the 1920s that Hetman managed to establish conscription, open an officers' academy and achieve minimal Ukrainianization of the armed forces. However, the political strife between the military under Hetman and the Soim, led by the king, left the Ukrainian armed forces in such disarray that they are in a dire need of reform."

ukrpol.1.t: "Our Kingdom"
ukrpol.1.d: "The Ukrainian State declared its independence with the support of Germany on April 28, 1918, when, as a result of a coup against the left-leaning Central Rada, the initial experiment with socialism in the form of a People’s Republic was canceled. Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, a strong-willed man and a former general of the Russian army, who set the tone for the future of Ukraine, came to power. This state of affairs was soon ratified by the Brest-Litovsk peace agreement.\n\nUkraine was to become a breadbasket used by the military aristocratic elite from all over Eastern Europe as a source of food, a convenient market for goods and a military bulwark against the weakened Russian Republic. Skoropadskyi relied on large landowners, the old bureaucracy and officers and sought to build a new Ukrainian monarchy with himself at the head. The leaders of the People’s Republic were expelled from the country, and their parties were banned, but they were able to establish a government in exile in neighboring Galicia-Lodomeria, where a significant part of Ukrainians lived.\n\nHowever, German aid soon turned into payment of informal debts to the allies for the Hetman. For some time, the dispute between Germany and its Austro-Hungarian ally continued after the Weltkrieg, eventually settling on a compromise according to which King Vasyl, the Austrian Archduke Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, would rule with the support of Skoropadskyi, who, as a German-allied \"Hetman\", has incredible powers both in civil and military matters. In fact, the Hetman still remained practically the sole ruler of Ukraine, limited only by the King and the Soim, which is increasingly dissatisfied with Skoropadskyi’s policy.\n\nNow, almost twenty years after the Weltkrieg, the situation in the country is unstable. The Reich forces us to sell our goods almost exclusively to countries within its sphere of influence, while syndicalists are gaining popularity every day among the oppressed rural poor and urban workers. Despite these many problems we face, our land is prosperous and fertile, our people are hardworking, and our potential is limitless."

ukrpol.2.t: "The Hetman"
ukrpol.2.d: "The role of the Hetman of Ukraine - the permanent Pavlo Skoropadskyi in domestic and foreign policy is very great. He is the supreme head of the state, the army and the judiciary. State administration was carried out by the Government appointed by him. Pavlo Skoropadskyi was proclaimed the guarantor of order and legality before the elections of the Ukrainian Soim. \n\nHowever, everything changed in 1927. As a result of the compromise of Germany with Austria-Hungary during the 1927 Ausgleich, the political system of the Hetmanate changed. Austrian Archduke Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, was crowned in Kyiv as King Vasyl, elections were held to the new Ukrainian Soim. As a result of all this, the Hetman’s power was limited, although he continued to be the supreme leader and commander-in-chief, and none of the decisions were made without his approval. The parties of the Soim that existed under strict control soon became quite oppositional and stopped seeing the Hetman as the only possible ruler of Ukraine. His desire for sole power rejected them and hindered the emerging ideology of Ukrainian monarchism and conservatism, which saw the Hetman as an exclusively symbolic figure.\n\nThe Hetman sees the future of Ukraine only in increasing his own power and turning the country into a real Hetmanate with himself at the head. And there would be practically no obstacles to this if it were not for the Soim and the King."

ukrpol.3.t: "The King"
ukrpol.3.d: "Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen is known to many as King Vasyl Vyshyvanyi. By many he is regarded as a symbol of foreign dominance, imposed on Ukraine as a result of a compromise between Germany and Austria. However, the others know, that Vasyl is fascinated by Ukrainian culture, he writes and speaks Ukrainian, and there is not a single argument, except for his origin, that he is not worthy of the throne of Ukraine. Even before he became Vasyl Vyshyvanyi, he received the nickname \"The Red Prince\" for his desire to improve the living conditions of the poor Ukrainian population of Galicia.\n\nFor almost 15 years, the Hetman of Ukraine has been doing everything to marginalize the King, and not giving him the opportunity to show his best side. Therefore, the only support and hope of Vasyl is Austria and the Ukrainian Soim. Of the several parties sitting there, Vasyl has long been an integral figure of the new Ukrainian Statehood. Having got rid of the Hetman, the authorities in the country will finally be able to rely on the ideas of Ukrainian Conservatism, maybe even allow Vasyl to throw off the foreign stigma of the \"King\" and become a real Hetman of Ukraine."
ukrpol.3.a: "Schob Vernuty Iyi Chest, Liazhem Holovamy"

ukrpol.300.t: "The Soim"
ukrpol.300.d: "The Ukrainian Soim, convened in 1927 shortly after the coronation of King Vasyl, was the hope not only of His Majesty, but also of the Ukrainian people for democratic change. However, the Hetman clung too tightly to his power. In fact, the Soim is only an advisory body, for the government is formed solely by the Hetman, and any bill can easily be rejected by him. This has allowed the political system of Ukraine to be mothballed.\n\nThere are three main parties in Soim, and many candidates from corporations and organizations, as well as non-partisans. The ruling party, the Union of Hetmantsiv-Derzhavnykiv (SHD or 'Derzhavnyks'), stands on firm pro-Hetman conservative positions and has Germanophile and Russophile wings, uniting mainly old tsarist ministers and landowners. The main oppositional party are the Ukrainian Union of Khliborobs-Derzhavnyks (USKhD or 'Khliborobs') and Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Independentists (UPSS or 'Samostiynyki').\n\nThere are also other parties that are not represented in the parliament, but have all chances to return to politics in the next elections - Dontsov's nationalists, Konovalets's militarists, as well as Doroshenko’s UPSF(m)."
ukrpol.300.a: "Nazovemsia Ukrainy Virnymy Synamy!"

ukrpol.4.t: "Our Economy"
ukrpol.4.d: "The economy of Ukraine is predominantly agrarian. In 1918, Land commissions were established, including the Supreme Land Commission, chaired by Skoropadskyi, to resolve land disputes and develop a land reform project.\n\nA stable currency and tax system were established, the state budget was developed and executed, State and Land Banks were created. Private land ownership, including the one for the large landowners, was restored, the peasants' ownership of land was confirmed with the allocation and sale of communal lands, which contributed to the formation of a broad class of medium-sized landowners. However, the state grain monopoly imposed by the Germans remained. The Skoropadskyi’s government relied on the restoration of large landlords and middle peasant farms, in which the German-Austrian occupation authorities were also interested. Supporting the Hetman, the landlords declared that small peasant farms were not able to provide large-scale commercial production of agricultural products, as demanded by war-ravaged Germany and Austria-Hungary from Ukraine. The soon-established supplies of industrial goods and agricultural implements to Ukraine from these countries helped ease the tense political and socio-economic situation in Ukrainian society.\n\nBy 1936, Ukraine had become one of the most promising economies in Europe, receiving a lot of money and investments from European powers. Industrial enterprises were restored and new ones were gradually created. However, there is only one fear - what if Europe stops buying our bread?"
ukrpol.4.a: "I doubt they will stop."

ukrpol.5.t: "The King Opens The Session Of The Soim"
ukrpol.5.d: "The Christmas festivities are over, and today was the first meeting of the Soim after the New Year’s break. The session was opened in person by King Vasyl, who addressed parliament and announced the need for a new budget for the year. His speech was met with skepticism by the majority consisting of members of the ruling Hetman’s Party, the SHD. However, the King’s supporters, the USKhD, cheerfully applauded the King’s speech, hastening to assure that Ukraine will be even richer and more successful this year."
ukrpol.5.a: "As useless as it could be."

ukrpol.6.t: "Donbas General Strike"
ukrpol.6.d: "Workers and miners in the east of the country staged another strike today over wage cuts and dissatisfaction with the huge number of working hours. They demand indulgences and refuse to work until their demands are met. Despite the fact that strikes are officially banned, Derzhavna Varta does not yet dare to disperse the workers, awaiting instructions from the central government"
ukrpol.6.a: "Make minor concessions to them."
ukrpol.6.b: "Suppress the strikers!"
ukrpol.6.c: "Ignore them, we have more serious problems."

ukrpol.7.t: "Derzhavna Varta Reports to the Hetman"
ukrpol.7.d: "Derzhavna Warta presented its annual report for the past year to Hetman Skoropadskyi personally, noting its merits in the fight against sabotage and terrorism on the territory of the Kingdom. The situation was especially tense in Odesa, where, according to the head of the State Guard, organized crime and banditry were rampant. Funded, according to Getman, by both French syndicalists and Romanian legionnaires, the troubled region has been at the center of various scandals for years. Measures must be taken to eliminate crime as quickly as possible."
ukrpol.7.a: "We must strengthen our anti-terrorist measures"

ukrpol.8.t: "Prosvita Spreads Anti-Monarchist Appeals"
ukrpol.8.d: "The Prosvita, which originally appeared as the Ukrainian Enlightenment Society, from the years of the civil war fell into the hands of the socialists and syndicalists of the Dyrektoria and conducts its subversive activities on the territory of the Kingdom, mainly spreading anti-monarchist slogans. Until recently, their activities had little impact, but with the onset of the crisis, more and more people prefer to believe in any criticism of the regime, seeing in it the culprit of all their misfortunes."
ukrpol.8.a: "Prosvita shall not pass!"

ukrpol.9.t: "Kyiv German Garrison Recalled"
ukrpol.9.d: "The German command in Kyiv, known as the German Garrison, was withdrawn to Berlin as a result of Black Monday. For the first time since 1918 German troops, though no longer as numerous, left the country entirely.\n\nThere is already speculation as to what the political consequences of this decision will be, but in the absence of German control over Ukraine, anything can happen. In any case, the political forces have already begun to consolidate and prepare for anything."
ukrpol.9.a: "It’s time to act."

ukrpol.10.t: "Dualism"
ukrpol.10.d: "The Ukrainian political system, according to many, is imperfect. On the one hand, the Hetman is quite an influential figure with many powers, but on the other hand his ambitions are limited by Soim and the presence of the King. Hetman has long dreamed of returning to the days when his power over Ukraine was virtually unlimited, and his place was not occupied by an Austrian impostor.\n\nOn the other hand, the King and Soim’s opposition parties are dissatisfied with Hetman’s power and believe that his presence interferes with the normal functioning of parliament. In any case, it has often come to a conflict, and now is the best moment to settle the matter once and for all."

### King's path to power ###
ukrpol.11.t: "In Search of Reliable Allies"
ukrpol.11.d: "In Ukraine, which has been almost completely cleansed of any political opposition, the Hetman regime is left with few rivals, and thus few potential allies.\n\nOn the one hand, our main ally in the parliament is Lypynskyi, the main ideologist of Ukrainian conservatism, who came into conflict with Hetman back in the mid-20’s and opposed his autocratic rule. Now he is not only the leader of the Soim opposition, but also the main critic of the regime and supporter of the king. An alliance with his party, the USKhD, is probably the most favorable prospect for us.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also dissatisfied Hetman among the Ukrainian armed forces. In particular, this is the Ukrainian Military Organization under the leadership of Konovalets. At first disarmed by Hetman, the Sichi Striltsi detachments were soon restored and had a significant influence on the formation of the armed forces. However, Konovalets himself, who holds more nationalistic views than Hetman, hardly supports Hetman."
ukrpol.11.a: "Lypynskyi is reliable enough" #will lead to UVO joining the Direktoriia and death of Konovalets
ukrpol.11.b: "What can we do without Sich Striltsi?" #UVO will attempt countercoup

ukrpol.12.t: "The Royal Conspiracy"
ukrpol.12.d: "King Vasyl had long thought that the Hetman was only in the way. The political system in which he finds himself is completely devoid of any transparency or honesty, and Hetman does everything to ensure that neither the Parliament nor the King has any influence on important political decisions. This must come to an end. A conspiracy against Hetman is brewing. This man must not remain in power, otherwise Ukraine will be in distress. It is necessary to look for allies to solve the problem of imperfect Ukrainian politics."
ukrpol.12.a: "The Hetman should go or be forced to go!"

ukrpol.13.t: "UVO Activities in Galicia"
ukrpol.13.d.king: "After the Ukrainian Military Organization was established, one of Konovalets' main associates, Andriy Melnyk, was sent to Galicia, where he headed the local militarized units of Ukrainian Striltsi. Now that we have joined together in a conspiracy against the Hetman with Konovalets, he insists that Melnyk should return to Ukraine and help us in the rebellion."
ukrpol.13.d.hetman: "After the Ukrainian Military Organization was established, one of Konovalets' main associates, Andriy Melnyk, was sent to Galicia, where he headed the local militarized units of Ukrainian Striltsi. Now that Konovalets is cooperating with Soim and King, he insists that Melnyk should return to Ukraine, which makes us feel uncomfortable about true UVO's intentions."

ukrpol.14.t: "Ukraine Seizes Polish Farms"
ukrpol.14.d: "We received information that the Ukrainian government has allowed requisition of Polish farms in West and Central Ukraine. Lobbied by the Ukraininan nationalists, they hopefully wanted to end the centuries-long Polish noblemen’s landholdings. However, they have just left our Polish brethren without any concessions. We should officially send a note of protest to the Ukrainian King!"
ukrpol.14.a: "How dare they?"

ukrpol.15.t: "Note of Protest From [FROM.GetName]"
ukrpol.15.d: "Upon learning of the requisitioning of Polish farms, the Polish government sent us a strong note of protest and expelled a couple of diplomats from their country. They demand that the nationalized property of citizens of Polish nationality be immediately returned to them or compensated. Perhaps we really overreacted and we should not spoil relations with the Poles, given that by doing so we might give them carte blanche to carry out similar repressions against Ukrainians on their territory."
ukrpol.15.a: "We should not risk our [FROM.GetAdjective] ally." #We can peacefully negotiate on Galicia later
ukrpol.15.b: "The domination of Shliakhta will end eventually." #Ukrainian-Polish relations will be destroyed

ukrpol.16.t: "Secret Rearmament in Bila Tserkva"
ukrpol.16.d: "In Bila Tserkva, the main stronghold of the Sichovi Striltsi and the location of the UVO headquarters, weapons were secretly delivered from the warehouses under Konovalets’s supervision to fully equip the detachments and prepare them for the capture of Kyiv and the liberation of the country from the Hetman. It is planned to raid the governor-general’s palace, the official residence of the Hetman and arrest him. In doing so, however, we may come face to face with Derzhavna Varta, who serves, among other things, as the Hetman’s personal guard. By accomplishing the coup quickly and with less blood, we will save the country from a full-fledged civil war."
ukrpol.16.a: "The Corps is ready to storm Kyiv"

ukrpol.17.t: "Peasant Discontent Is Growing"
ukrpol.17.d: "In the provinces, peasant discontent with rising food prices is growing. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about it, as long as our economy is unstable and the Hryvnia has not stabilized enough. Given the current situation, we need to take some measures to reassure disgruntled farmers."
ukrpol.17.king: "Tighten your belts!"
ukrpol.17.hetman: "Introduce benefits!"

ukrpol.18.t: "Advisor to the King"
ukrpol.18.d: "With the conclusion of the alliance between the King and Lypynskyi, he was granted the right to become an official royal advisor. This way, according to Vasyl, Lypynskyi would be safe, because the Hetman would not dare to encroach on the royal advisor without causing an international scandal involving Austria and Germany. Now Hetman’s hands are virtually tied, and even if he banned Lypynskyi’s party, we can be sure of his personal safety.\n\nMoreover, the position of royal advisor, despite its formality, also gives Lypynskyi the right to officially represent the king."
ukrpol.18.king: "Notify the Hetman of the new position at the Royal court"
ukrpol.18.hetman: "Seems like Lypynskyi received security guarantees."

ukrpol.19.t: "Sich Striltsi Disarmed and Disbanded!"
ukrpol.19.d: "Today it became known that on Hetman’s order all units of the elite units of the Sichovi Striltsi were disarmed and disbanded. Their commander, Yevhen Konovalets, was also demoted. According to Hetman, these units were characterized by virtually uncontrolled activities that were harmful to Ukraine and made it vulnerable to external and internal threats."
ukrpol.19.king: "Who does this Hetman think he is?"
ukrpol.19.hetman: "Another source of instability is destroyed."

ukrpol.20.t: "Yevhen Konovalets Shot Dead!"
ukrpol.20.d: "Today it became known about the unfortunate death of Colonel Yevhen Konovalets, the former leader of the Sichovi Striltsi and the Ukrainian Military Organization. \n\nThis morning in Kyiv, while Konovalets was walking through the city, he was suddenly approached by an unknown assailant who shot the colonel three times. One of the bullets pierced his lung and the other hit his heart, causing Konovalets to die on the spot, bleeding to death. The unknown assailant managed to escape and his whereabouts are still unknown. Derzhavna Varta officially ordered an investigation into the premeditated murder and promised to do everything possible to find the culprit.\n\nThe king spoke on the radio, deploring the death of one of the best sons of the fatherland, a defender of Ukraine and a hero. Hetman also spoke, promising to punish the perpetrators by all means, and stating that it was largely thanks to the colonel that Ukraine was able to defend itself."
ukrpol.20.king: "A great loss for Ukraine"
ukrpol.20.hetman: "We do not forgive traitors"

ukrpol.21.t: "A Royal Visit to Vienna"
ukrpol.21.d: "Today it became known about the planned visit of King Vasyl to Vienna. He will attend a reception at the royal palace, where he will meet with Emperor Charles, and then attend unofficial events. As a member of the Habsburg royal family, Vasyl is always welcomed in Vienna."
ukrpol.21.a: "Let us hope they agree"

ukrpol.22.t: "King Vasyl Arrives to Vienna"
ukrpol.22.d: "Today King Vasyl of Ukraine visited Vienna, specifically a reception at the royal palace, where he met with Emperor Charles. Later on, however, the King made a strange request to support him with arms or finances and warned of an assassination attempt being prepared against him. He said that the era of the Hetman was coming to an end and that Ukraine must move into a new phase of nation-building. Whatever that means, we need to support Habsburg!"
ukrpol.22.a: "Provide all the help needed."
ukrpol.22.b: "We cannot spare anything." 

ukrpol.23.t: "Austria Agrees to Help"

ukrpol.25.t: "Lypky Assault"
ukrpol.25.d.uvo: "Today, shots were heard in the Kyiv district of Lypky, where the former palace of the governor-general and now the residence of Hetman Skoropadskyi is located. \n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, around noon, units of Sichovi Striltsi under the command of Yevhen Konovalets arrived in the city. Their purpose was to arrest the Hetman, dissolve the Derzhavna Varta and proclaim the power of Soim and the King. Soon there was a gunfight heard between the Derzhavna Varta and the Striltsi, which also acted as a guard for the Hetman, with little loss on either side. The Hetman appealed to the Army to protect the city from the rebellion of the Striltsi, but the officers refused to carry out the order. Soon the Hetman was forced to surrender. He formally abdicated his position of Hetman, being arrested after that.\n\nIn the headlines, the events took place as the Lypky Assault. Shortly after the arrest of the Hetman, an emergency meeting was convened in Soim, at which the King spoke, announcing the end of the era of repression. He also announced that in view of Skoropadskyi’s inability to fulfill his duties as Hetman, he himself became acting Hetman until the leader of one of the parliamentary factions is appointed to the position.\n\nIn Germany, the events were perceived ambiguously, dubbing the events as a coup d'état."
ukrpol.25.d: "Today, shots were heard in the Kyiv district of Lypky, where the former palace of the governor-general and now the residence of Hetman Skoropadskyi is located. \n\nAccording to eyewitness accounts, protests and riots against the hetman began in the city around 10 a.m., initiated by the USKhD. Their aim was to arrest the hetman, dissolve the Derzhavna Varta and proclaim the power of the Soim and the King. The Army was introduced into the city, but it took the side of the rebels. Soon there was a gunfight between the Derzhavna Varta, which also served as the Hetman’s guard, and the Army, with small casualties on both sides. Soon the Hetman was forced to surrender.

ukrpol.25.a: "The End of the Hetmanate!"

ukrpol.26.t: "Consolidating the Hetman’s Power"
ukrpol.26.d: "Ukraine needs reform; the dual power situation can no longer continue. Even though opposition parties are in the minority, Hetman's power needs to be strengthened. On the one hand, we can trust Mykola Mikhnovskyi, previously exiled to Kuban, but the only person who can support Skoropadskyi from the 'Independist camp'.\nSoim, on the other hand, only brings instability to our current situation, for which Hetman could issue emergency powers and dissolve parliament."
ukrpol.26.a: "We should trust Mikhnovskyi." #will lead to UVO joining Dyrektoria as soon as it revolts
ukrpol.26.b: "It is time to dissolve the Soim." #will lead to death of Konovalets

ukrpol.27.t: "Appointment of the New Governors"
ukrpol.27.d: "As part of the expansion of the coalition with the Mikhnovites, Hetman passed a resolution appointing new governors: in particular, appointing Fedir Sumnevych as provincial commissar of Volyn and Podillia. Volodymyr Strashkevych, a literary scholar and linguist, was appointed governor of Vinnytsia at Mikhnovskyi's suggestion."

ukrpol.27.hetman: "Hope we can count on them"

ukrpol.28.t: "Ukrainian Conservatism Discredited"
ukrpol.28.d: "Today in a major government newspaper, surprised Kyivans could read an interesting article that Ukrainian conservatism, as articulated by Viacheslav Lypynskyi, is bad for Ukraine. Many were puzzled, how could a government newspaper condemn the official ideology of the leading party, but soon everything fell into place. It turned out that the only correct Ukrainian conservatism can be only with a Hetman at the head, and of Ukrainian origin, which is only Pavlo Skoropadskyi. And the monarchist Lypynskyi, leader of the opposition, promotes Germanic rule over Ukraine, supporting the claims of a German-imposed king."
ukrpol.28.hetman: "Who even supports the Austrian Impostor?"
ukrpol.28.king: "Hetman discredited the 'Hetman movemement', ridiculous."

ukrpol.29.t: "Soim Dissolved. Martial Law Enacted."
ukrpol.29.d: "According to Article 16 of the Laws on the State Structure of Ukraine, the Hetman has the right to dissolve the Soim and establish a state of emergency at any time. This article, which significantly restricts parliament, allows the Hetman to occupy the dominant position in the state structure of Ukraine, but so far this article has never been used, due to the strong position of the pro-Hetman SHD party and the weakness of the anti-Hetman opposition in parliament.\n\nUsing his emergency powers, Skoropadskyi announced the premature dissolution of the Sejm and the assumption of full authority under the state of emergency caused by the economic crisis and the unbridled terrorist activities unleashed by the Dyrektoria. \n\nThanks to this, the Hetman will have the right to pass any emergency laws, including those that will help him to establish his absolute power."
ukrpol.29.hetman: "Our State needs stability, not empty chatter!"
ukrpol.29.king: "Another loophole in our Constitution!"

ukrpol.30.t: "Hetman’s Emergency Powers"
ukrpol.30.d: "Under the state of emergency, Hetman Skoropadskyi issued a decree to assume emergency powers and intensify anti-terrorist measures until Ukraine returned to the path of stability and the Dyrektoria was destroyed.\n\nAs part of his extraordinary powers, apparently used to reduce the influence of Parliament and the King, literally the first decree of Pan Hetman was the right of the Hetman to appoint a government, a right previously taken away from him by a change in the laws. Although the Hetman only confirmed the Otaman of Ministers and the ministers themselves proposed by Soim, such a measure would enable him not merely to reject all the proposals of the opposition parliament, but simply to ignore them."
ukrpol.30.hetman: "Just a suspension of externally imposed laws"
ukrpol.30.king: "Skoropadskyi only makes himself new enemies"

ukrpol.31.t: "Conspiracy Rumors"
ukrpol.31.d: "Rumors circulating in the press and in small circles about a plot in the armed forces and parliament to overthrow Hetman have flooded the backstage of the government. \n\nAccording to the latest information, a group of high-ranking generals is planning to establish a new power by armed force and arrest Hetman, the main beneficiaries being, of course, the King and the opposition parliament.\n\nThis state of affairs is unacceptable, and the Hetman has therefore issued a decree granting the Power Varta the power to conduct searches and wiretaps without the need for a judicial warrant, for the security of the country and the state."

Our minister of security has just received a telegram from a socialist group claiming responsibility for mining His yacht, stating that the action was as a result of their exclusion from the democratic process. There was no chance to save our King and already the country has been plunged into disorder.\n\nThe Hetman, now alone with an empty throne, has announced that soon the Heir to the throne would be chosen by the Regency Council, headed by him, and the succession issues all to be resolved.\n\nBefore it happens, though, he has announced that he will stay as the Supreme Leader, with Martial Law still in effect."

ukrpol.35.d: "Today the Sichovi Striltsi marched out of Bila Tserkva in full combat readiness, and recruited an additional volunteer legion. It was not difficult for them to bypass the roadblocks, where they met little or no resistance, and enter Kyiv. Soon there was an assault on the royal palace near the Soim, but the defenders soon laid down their arms in view of the superiority of the enemy. The police also refused to participate in what was going on, which left the King alone with a crowd of armed men.\n\nVasyl hastily signed the abdication, appointing Konovalets as regent. At the same time, the Striltsi arrested the Soim in its entirety and announced its temporary dissolution until the next elections. Vasyl was given the chance to leave the country, which he did, traveling to Lviv.\n\nOn the same evening, newspapers published Konovalets' appeal to the inhabitants of Ukraine that the Kingdom had fallen and a new, national republic would now replace the past corrupt government. The population as a whole supported the nationalist coup, hoping for a change for the better in the economic life of the country and long-awaited sovereignty from outside forces."

No one, of course, officially stylized Mikhnovskyi's stay in the Kuban as exile, but everyone was well aware of it. And now, a decade later, Mikhnovskyi himself appeared in Kyiv - the new Minister of Foreign Affairs at the behest of the Hetman himself.\n\nOf course, for many people it was rather a symbol of the decline of the Hetmanate. Having hesitated to appoint Mikhnovskyi as Otaman of the Council of Ministers in 1918, Hetman offered him the place of his \"Personal Advisor (Bunchuznyi Tovarish)\", which deeply hurt the feelings of the ambitious politician, who soon afterwards went into opposition, but could not support the Socialists of the Dyrektoria either, whom he hated.\n\nWith the appointment of Mikhnovskyi as Minister of Foreign Affairs, one should not expect much. And despite the fact that Hetman now has at least some ally, let's see what this partnership will bring in the future."
ukrpol.301.king: "That lunatic? Pathetic..."
ukrpol.301.hetman: "We welcome Mikhnovskyi in Kyiv!"

### First Dyrektoria uprising (ukrpol.36-100)

ukrpol.36.t: "Fall of Rivne"
ukrpol.36.d: "Tonight, detachments of thousands of troops of the so-called \"Army of the UNR\" under the leadership of Symon Petliura crossed the border of Galicia and Ukraine. On their way they hastily seized Lutsk, which surrendered without a fight, and headed toward Rivne. \n\nIn Rivne by that time they already knew about the approaching troops and declared a state of emergency. However, to the surprise of many, the Dyrektoria’s propaganda worked to their advantage, and the townspeople and many of the gendarmes not only abandoned the confrontation, but also took the side of the Republic. Small battles broke out in the city, but our troops were forced to retreat and take up defensive positions near Zhytomyr and Vinnytsia. \n\nMeanwhile, the head of the Dyrektoria, Volodymyr Vynnychenko, arrived in Rivne, immediately announcing the restoration of the Ukrainian People’s Republic and the liberation march on Kyiv."
ukrpol.36.a: "We should mobilize!"

ukrpol.37.t: "Uprising Crushed!"
ukrpol.37.d: "Tonight, detachments of thousands of troops of the so-called \"Army of the UNR\" under the leadership of Symon Petliura crossed the border of Galicia and Ukraine. On their way they hastily seized Lutsk, which surrendered without a fight, and headed toward Rivne. \n\nIn Rivne by that time they already knew about the approaching troops and declared a state of emergency. The city was ready for a siege and was well armed. The UNR Army was unable to take it and was driven back to Lutsk, where our troops counterattacked to dislodge them from the city. Seeing the enormous superiority of our troops, the UNR army rushed to flee with Petliura until control of the border with Galicia was fully restored.\n\nThe Dyrektoria’s "liberation" campaign clearly failed and they were forced to lay low in Galicia."
ukrpol.37.a: "The Ukrainian borders are safe!"

ukrpol.38.t: "The Dyrektoria Question"
ukrpol.38.d: "After the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] had more or less gained power, a telegram reached our leadership from Galicia that the so-called Dyrektoria was ready to recognize our government on the condition that fair elections were held. Although the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] is convinced that the socialists have no place in the new Ukraine, we could have accepted their offer, because in that case a sufficient number of experienced generals of the UNR, including Petliura, would have joined our troops. As for the elections, the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] insists on maintaining the \"temporary\" dictatorship of the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] until better times come, without, however, openly stating when those times will come.\n\nOn the other hand, the recognition of the Dyrektoria may undermine our credibility and sooner or later their socialist leaders may direct the people’s discontent not at our enemies, but at ourselves."
ukrpol.38.a: "Some of them may join us."
ukrpol.38.b: "We are not welcoming any socialists here."

ukrpol.39.t: "The Ukrainian Galician Army Leaves for Ukraine"
ukrpol.39.d: "The officers, serving in the Ukrainian Galician Army, formed in the early 1920s, have left our country in order to join the uprising of the Ukrainian People’s Republic in Rivne.\n\nThey have left the Galicia-Lodomeria today in the morning and are expected to arrive in Rivne tomorrow.\nThe UGA, led by an experienced officer, Hnat Stefaniv, was an important volunteer force in our state, and the only possible garrison in the Ukrainian-majority territory."
ukrpol.39.a: "Off they go!"

ukrpol.40.t: "Officers From Ukrainian Galician Army Join"
ukrpol.40.d: "The officers, serving in the Ukrainian Galician Army, formed in the early 1920s, have joined our Command.\n\nThey have left the Galicia-Lodomeria yesterday morning and have now arrived in Rivne, where the headquarters of the Ukrainian People’s Republic is located.\nThe UGA, led by an experienced officer, Hnat Stefaniv, has taken an oath of loyalty and allegiance to the People’s Republic."
ukrpol.40.a: "Splendid!"

ukrpol.41.t: "UPSS Defects to Dyrektoria!"
ukrpol.41.d: "With the demise of the king, the last hope of the Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Independentists for a legal struggle against the Hetman and the restoration of democracy faded into oblivion. After Hetman's flirting with Russophiles, sluggish Ukrainianization and building of aristocratic-authoritarian regime, it seems that the last patriots of Hetmanshchyna have not endured. Today it has become known that the Central Committee of the UPSS has declared its support for the Dyrektoria, and through General Hrekiv's \"Batkivschyna\" community a mass transfer of soldiers and whole regiments to the positions of our opponents in Volyn has begun."
ukrpol.41.a: "We always knew they were traitors!"

ukrpol.42.t: "Ukrainian Ambassador Questions Crimea Status"
ukrpol.42.d: "With the uprising of the leftists in Ukraine finally suppressed, we are now obliged to return what is rightfull Ukrainian - their fleet and their peninsula of Crimea, that we occupied in order to secure our influence."
ukrpol.42.a: "Return them Crimea and the fleet."

ukrpol.43.t: "Germany Returns Crimea!"
ukrpol.43.d: "The German Ambassador in Kyiv has just informed the government and the [GetUKRTitle] that the temporary occupation of our Crimean peninsula and the Black Fleet is over, effectively returning it back to us."
ukrpol.43.a: "Our friends in Berlin are our true friends."

ukrpol.44.t: "Rebels Cut Off [93.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]" # Brest
ukrpol.44.d: "The city of [792.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] became the first city to fall in rebel hands. There was little resistance, as most of the garrison had mutinied or even joined the Dyrektoria's peasant militias. The city's Jewish-Polish majority welcomed the republican forces with cheers. With the stronghold established, the main railway from [202.GetName] to [93.GetName] was cut. Not wasting any time, the People's Army started to advance to every direction.\n\nThe most critical situation is in [93.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], as the city cannot be reinforced, and the countryside around it is quickly declaring its allegiance to the republican government. The commander is requesting permission to ask help from the Polish army right across the border, arguing that it is the only way to hold the city. It is true that the rebels would most likely avoid attacking foreign soldiers, in fear that it would give the Polish Army justification to support the [GetUKRTitle]. However, relying on foreign forces would be also a sign of weakness for the [GetUKRTitle]. The alternative option is to forbid them from such desperate pleads, and vaguely promise support as long as they hold the city."
ukrpol.44.a: "Message the Poles."
ukrpol.44.b: "We can deal with couple of peasants."

ukrpol.45.t: "Poles Save [93.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]" # Brest
ukrpol.45.d: "The clash between Ukrainian republican rebels and the garrison at [93.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] could have easily ended in a catastrophe for the Hetmanate's forces. However their request for support was answered by Poland's 5th Infantry Division stationed at [1088.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Based on the military alliance between the two countries, Polish forces entered the city and bolstered its defences to the point that rebels didn't dare to continue their assault, and instead retreated to rural [997.GetName], continuing to wage the partisan war from there."
ukrpol.45.a: "Unexpected, but welcome."

ukrpol.46.t: "[93.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Surrendered!" # Brest
ukrpol.46.d: "[93.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s orders were clear - to resist the rebels to the last bullet. It didn't take much to break the commander's spirit, though. Some of the garrison mutinied, saying that they would not shoot their countrymen. Combined with heavy public pressure from the population, he decided to order surrender, and lay down the weapons, as relief from [202.GetName] was obviously not arriving any time soon."
ukrpol.46.a: "Sad!"

ukrpol.54.t: "Talks with Crimean Dyrektoria"
ukrpol.54.d: "The recent clashes in Crimea have shown that there is also an anti-Hetmanist movement there. We have contacted the so-called Crimean Dyrektoria and its leader, Solomon Krym. He has recently returned from exile to lead a separatist anti-Hetmanist movement. However, his final goal is to make Crimean Tatars independent, which is not what our plans are."
ukrpol.54.a: "We should have an ally in the south."
ukrpol.54.b: "What?! Crimea is Ukraine!"

ukrpol.55.t: "Peasant Unrest in South-East"
ukrpol.55.d: "In the rural regions of [227.GetName] and [200.GetName] the peasants have rebelled against our rule. Fooled by the Dyrektorian propaganda, they have decided that everything good that happened to them during the Hetmanate was bad. We failed to secure our rear and now we have to deal with the peasants as well."
ukrpol.55.a: "Damn!"

ukrpol.56.t: "Peasants Take Up Pitchforks and Arms!"
ukrpol.56.d: "More and more peasants are joining the unrest, causing damage to the towns and cities of Ukraine!"
ukrpol.56.a: "Damn!"

ukrpol.61.t: "Decisive Blow to the Dyrektoria"
ukrpol.61.d: "Loyal troops were able to successfully break through the defenses built by the rebels in Rivne and seized most of Volhynia. The peasant uprising in the South was successfully suppressed, and finally the entire territory of Ukraine was back under our control.\n\nThe cowardly Republicans were able to hide in Galicia, but we have no doubt that they will no longer venture into our territory with their anti-state slogans, and sooner or later we will be able to negotiate with the Austrians so that they will give us these traitors and criminals."
ukrpol.61.a: "Victory!"

ukrpol.63.t: "Fall of Kyiv"
ukrpol.63.d: "After prolonged resistance and siege, key troops were withdrawn from Kyiv and the city was surrendered to the enemy. Our ruler was forced to leave power and the capital and go abroad, losing control of most of the country. However, this was not the end. Although power no longer extended to the Southeast and South, where the formation of people's councils and self-government of workers and peasants had effectively begun, and, in some cases, treacherous defections to the enemy, there were still remnants of loyalists in the country who did not want to surrender."
ukrpol.63.a: "Hetman is forced to abdicate!"
ukrpol.63.b: "King flees to Austria!"
ukrpol.63.c: "Striltsi give up the city!"

ukrpol.64.t: "The Remnants of Derzavnyks"
ukrpol.64.d: "The last troops, who had praised the King and the Hetman until long ago, finally surrendered. We have been able to establish complete control over our territories, and despite the widespread chaos, growing anarchy and banditry, we can confidently say that in the midst of all this mess there are no more people left who are willing to take up arms against our new, popular government, for the rule of landlords and hetmans. \n\nThe era of injustice and inequality is over, military parades are being held in the cities, and people are triumphing and plundering the rich grounds of their neighbors. Ukraine is unstable, and it needs to return to unity for the sake of the common future of our citizens."
ukrpol.64.a: "Victory!"

ukrpol.66.t: "Workers Rebel in the East!"
ukrpol.66.d: "Despite the initial peasant uprisings were crushed in the South and in the East, now the workers have risen a second powerful uprising, also joined by some peasants. Seizing some of the administrative buildings and also stopping the factories, they are a serious threat to the Hetmanate regime."
ukrpol.66.a: "A serious blow to the Hetmanate!"
ukrpol.66.b: "We must do something!"

### Dyrektoria interactions

ukrpol.67.t: "Ukrainian Demands"
ukrpol.67.d: "The Ukrainian government has sent us an official note of protest for supporting the so-called Dyrektoria, the government of the Ukrainian People’s Republic in exile. According to them, we are harboring terrorists who are actively engaged in sabotage and anti-monarchist propaganda in Ukraine."
ukrpol.67.a: "What can we do?"
ukrpol.67.b: "Pressure the 'Dyrektoria'"

ukrpol.68.t: "Galicia Can Do Nothing"
ukrpol.68.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has told us that they can do nothing in order to stop this. They believe that it is our internal affairs and our problems, they just host the government-in-exile and they cannot arrest them."
ukrpol.68.a: "Damn."

ukrpol.69.t: "Galicia Pressures Dyrektoria"
ukrpol.69.d: "Our [FROM.GetAdjective] representatives have confirmed that they have threatened the Dyrektoria to cease any operations in [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] with stopping their support for their 'government-in-exile'."
ukrpol.69.a: "Great!"

ukrpol.70.t: "Anti-Monarchist Protests in Large Cities"
ukrpol.70.d: "Today, anti-government rallies were held in major cities, in spite of the direct prohibition of the Derzavna Varta and Hetman, under brightly colored anti-monarchist slogans. Crowds of townspeople, mostly workers and poor bourgeoisie, demanded bread and the abdication of the king, as well as a change of government, the legalization of strikes and opposition parties, in general - everything that the revolutionary-terrorists of the Dyrektoria had promised them. \n\nThe crowds of protesters at first felt completely unpunished until heavily armed punitive squads arrived in the cities, and army troops were even brought into some major cities. The crowds were dispersed, usually without casualties, and the instigators were arrested and awaiting trial."
ukrpol.70.a: "Disperse the crowd!"

ukrpol.71.t: "Borotbysts Distribute Leaflets"
ukrpol.71.d: "We have heard rumors that the only terrorist organization operating in Ukraine, calling itself the Borotbysts, which does not formally associate itself with the Dyrektoria, has begun to distribute leaflets calling for an all-Ukrainian strike to stop factories and other industry and the revolutionary demands of the people, among which are the resignation of the government and the abdication of the king.\n\nThis state of affairs is totally unsatisfactory, and in this connection the Hetman ordered the Derzhavna Varta to immediately begin intensified reconnaissance of the alleged source of these leaflets, and to find and arrest the management of the printers who agreed to print these anti-government leaflets."
ukrpol.71.a: "Find the typographies that helps them!"

ukrpol.72.t: "Russophiles Announce Support for Skoropadskyi"
ukrpol.72.d: "The russophiles, mainly situated in the State Army and in the ruling party of SHD, are rallying in the support of the Hetman Skoropadskyi. They see him as a true successor of the Imperial order and lobby reorientation towards Russia."
ukrpol.72.a: "Interesting."

ukrpol.73.t: "Unrest in Volhynia"
ukrpol.73.d: "Volhynia is considered one of the unstable provinces of our state, because of its proximity to the borders of Galicia, it is in Rivne that the sympathies of the Dyrektoria and the Republican movement are strongest. Despite our efforts to pacify Rivne, spontaneous rallies were held there today under the banners of the Dyrektoria and demanding the convening of an All-Ukrainian Constituent Assembly. The peaceful rallies soon turned into riots, and the police had to forcibly disperse the rampaging crowd of looters and protesters."
ukrpol.73.a: "We cannot lose Volhynia!"

ukrpol.74.t: "Kharkiv Strikes"
ukrpol.74.d: "In addition to the west of the country, the east is also restless. Workers in Kharkiv went on mass strike today, demanding a shorter workday and higher wages. Following Donbas, Kharkiv residents sabotaged the work of large factories in the east. Anti-monarchist and socialist slogans were again strong among the slogans that spread. The strike was suppressed, and additional security forces were brought into the region."
ukrpol.74.a: "Will they ever calm down?"

ukrpol.75.d: "Today at 11 a.m. while the Ukrainian King Vasyl was relaxing on his yacht, an explosion ripped through the hull immediately killing him. Our minister of security has just received a telegram from a socialist group claiming responsibility for mining His yacht, stating that the action was as a result of their exclusion from the democratic process. There was no chance to save our King and already the country has been plunged into disorder.\n\nThe Hetman, now alone with an empty throne, has announced that soon the Heir to the throne would be chosen by the Regency Council, headed by him, and the succession issues all to be resolved.\n\nBefore it happens, though, he has announced that he will stay as the Supreme Leader, with Martial Law still in effect."

ukrpol.76.d: "Today, shots were heard in the Kyiv district of Lypky, Ukraine, where the former palace of the governor-general and now the residence of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi is located.\n\nAccording to the eyewitnesses, around noon, there has been armed clashes between Skoropadskyi’s loyalists and the opposition, which eventually led to the defeat of the Hetman. He was forced to retire and abdicate his claims to the Hetmanate. The King has announced that the power in the country is to be transfered to the elected Ukrainian Soim. In Germany, the events were perceived ambiguously, dubbing the events as a coup d'état."

ukrpol.77.t: "Volhynia Secured!"
ukrpol.77.d: "We have managed to successfully secure control over the whole Volhynia region. Now, the Dyrektoria is divided on the matter on what to do next. We can take a break and get ready for the full-scale war or try to establish control over Kyiv in a short amount of time, due to the help of Striltsi in Bila Tserkva."
ukrpol.77.a: "We should get ready for attack."
ukrpol.77.b: "We should do it quickly and bloodless"

ukrpol.78.t: "Kyiv Falls!"
ukrpol.78.d: "Thanks to the Striltsi, we managed to quickly seize Kyiv and establish our control there. The monarchist forces tried to fight back, but fellow Ukrainians walked to the streets to show their support for the Dyrektoria government. The Hetmanists never managed to shoot at the crowd and they had to give up with [UPR.GetLeader] fleeing abroad."
ukrpol.78.a: "People on our side!"

ukrpol.79.t: "Our Attack Repulsed!"
ukrpol.79.d: "It seems we've lost the momentum and our regiments in Bila Tserkva were too weak, but surprisingly the Monarchists managed to protect the capital city from us. It seems we have no other choice but to engage in a merciless fight with Hetmanists."
ukrpol.79.a: "Unfortunately..."

ukrpol.81.t: "Uprising Crushed!"
ukrpol.81.d: "The operation was successful. Before Dyrektoria managed to secure their control over Volhynia, we managed to raise some loyalists in Berestia and Lutsk, and with the help of Zhytomyr garrison we have surrounded the headquarters of the rebels. Some of them managed to escape, but demoralized rebel troops have all surrendered."
ukrpol.81.a: "Did they really want to defeat us?"

ukrpol.82.t: "Failure of the Operation"
ukrpol.82.d: "Unfortunately, the operation was a complete failure. We missed when Dyrektoria managed to secure their control over Volhynia, and by the time our agents arrived there, they have already been ready. Our Agents were surrounded and the attack failed. It seems that the full-scale war is even closer now."
ukrpol.82.a: "We should get ready"

ukrpol.89.t: "Confrontation Escalates!"
ukrpol.89.d: "It has been several weeks since we lost control of Volyn, and the revolutionaries have occupied Rivne and established organizations under their control in the region. All this time, new recruits and insurgents have been pouring into their territory from Galicia and even from Naddnipryanshchina. Finally, however, we can confidently state that we have established full control over the line of contact, and according to our intelligence, the last stronghold of resistance to the revolutionaries in Volhynia has been destroyed. All this clearly leads to an escalation of the confrontation, for the Dyrektoria was able to establish full control over its territory and now they are clearly preparing to strike at the capital."
ukrpol.89.a: "We shall crush the insurgency!"

ukrpol.90.t: "UPSS Demands a Role in the Government"
ukrpol.90.d: "In view of the success of the coup d'état, the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Independentists, which is in opposition to the USKhD, made ultimatums to the king to appoint a prime minister from among the UPSS. \n\nSince anarchy was brewing in the countryside and the Dyrektoria troops were preparing to march out of Galicia, the UPSS, together with the \"Batkivschyna\" military association, issued an ultimatum to the king to appoint a new government headed by the UPSS. In return, the UPSS promises to save the country from anarchy.\n\nThe king was clearly puzzled by this approach. On the one hand, the formation of a new government headed by the UPSS would put the USKhD and Lypynskyi, the king's longtime supporters, in stiff opposition. On the other hand, if refused, the King would have to fight the social-nationalist opposition, and it was likely that the UPSS would then join the Dyrektoria."
ukrpol.90.a: "Agree to their ultimatum!"
ukrpol.90.b: "The King should not accept any ultimatums."

### Pavlo Skoropadskyi Main Political ###
ukrpol.100.t: "Hetman Skoropadskyi Visits Austria"
ukrpol.100.d: "Today the Hetman of All Ukraine, Pavlo Skoropadskyi, arrived in Vienna with an official delegation. Such a high-ranking meeting may indicate that the Hetman has something to tell our government about the terrible act of terrorism that took place on the Dnieper River, and which resulted in the death of the King of Ukraine, Vasyl, known as Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen. \n\nThe hetman announced that the investigation has already started and that the justice will triumph. The Hetman also stated that the Dyrektoria, a group of Ukrainian exiles sitting in Eastern Galicia, represent a kind of body claiming power in all of Ukraine and their recent fail to overthrow both King and Hetman has ultimately failed. The Dyrektoria consists of various kinds of Ukrainian nationalists and socialists, who prefer to organize terror. Hetman cited much evidence of their active anti-monarchist activities prior to the explosion on the Dnieper.\n\nIn this regard, Hetman once again expressed his condolences to the royal house of Habsburg, and moved on to more pressing issues, namely the question of the belonging of Galicia and the Ukrainians living there. He said that under Ukrainian supervision the Dyrektoria based there would be defeated, of which we can have no doubt."
ukrpol.100.a: "Better not lose such an ally."
ukrpol.100.b: "No talks until Leo Stefan is crowned a King of Ukraine!"

ukrpol.101.t: "Austria Agrees!"
ukrpol.101.d: "Hetman was able to negotiate with the Austrians for the transfer of the Ukrainian-speaking lands of Galicia-Lodomeria to the control of our country. Moreover, he did so on quite favorable terms, not only reconciling our governments after the explosion on the Dnieper, but also promising benefits for trade with Austria. "
ukrpol.101.a: "Splendid!"

ukrpol.102.t: "Austria Refused!"
ukrpol.102.d: "The Hetman had recently arrived in Vienna for important negotiations on the status of Galicia and trade with Austria. Despite his arguments, Austria refused to give us control of the Ukrainian lands until Vasyl’s heir, Leo Stefan, was crowned king of Ukraine.\n\nOf course, the Hetman reminded the Austrian government that the question of the succession had not been resolved during Vasyl’s reign, and therefore the heir to the throne was an unresolved issue that would be decided by the Regency Council. This, however, in no way saved our situation."
ukrpol.102.a: "Their loss!"

ukrpol.103.t: "Ukraine Demands We Increase the Tariffs!"
ukrpol.103.d: "There was a suggestion from our friendly Ukraine that we immediately raise import tariffs, a measure we took at the dawn of Black Monday to stabilize the economic situation and which led Ukraine itself into an agricultural crisis and almost collapse. \n\nThe proposal, however, is more in the form of demands and clearly tests our government's loyalty to the Ukrainian regime. Despite the fact that this state has an exceptional role in our alliance and the stability of the supply and food supply for our large army, economists calculate that the decision to raise tariffs could harm our not yet fully established economy."
ukrpol.103.a: "Better not lose such an ally"
ukrpol.103.b: "Our position remains the same."

ukrpol.104.t: "Germany Agrees!"
ukrpol.104.d: "The German government has agreed to increase the tarrifs, so necessary for us to make profitable contracts, considering wheat and product exports."
ukrpol.104.a: "The breadbasket is safe now."

ukrpol.105.t: "Germany Refused!"
ukrpol.105.d: "The German government has refused our demands, leaving the tarrifs as they are, meaning that we will continue to lose money and agricultural products."
ukrpol.105.b: "Eh, alright, we still need their protection."
ukrpol.105.a: "That’s not how allies behave - threaten with leaving the Reichspakt!"
ukrpol.105.c: "We must seek cooperation with Russia instead!"

ukrpol.106.t: "Ukraine Threatens Us!"
ukrpol.106.d: "The Ukrainian government, outraged by our decision has now threatened us with leaving our military alliance."
ukrpol.106.a: "We don't need them"
ukrpol.106.b: "Alright, we agree on their terms."

ukrpol.107.t: "German Excludes Us From Reichspakt"
ukrpol.107.d: "The German goverment has refused to listen to our demands and has forcefully excluded us from the Reichspakt."
ukrpol.107.a: "That’s definetely a treason against Ukraine!"

ukrpol.108.t: "Ukraine Proposes Cooperation"
ukrpol.108.d: "The Ukrainian government has proposed cooperation in terms of trade, clearly signaling our government about friendly intentions of the Ukrainian leader [UKR.GetLeader] towards our state."
ukrpol.108.a: "We must cooperate with our slavic brothers!"
ukrpol.108.b: "We don't trust them."

ukrpol.109.t: "Russo-Ukrainian Cooperation"
ukrpol.109.d: "The Russian government has willingly accepted our proposal, meaning that we should now sign necessary contracts for trade benefits and exchange between two our neighboring countries."
ukrpol.109.a: "A new partner in the East!"

ukrpol.110.t: "Russia Refused Cooperation!"
ukrpol.110.d: "The Russian government has refused to accept our proposal, clearly meaning that they don't view us as a sovereign subject and are rather getting ready to attack and forcefully annex us!"

ukrpol.118.t: "The SHD Nominates the Hetman as an Heir!"
ukrpol.118.d: "The ruling party of the SHD nominated the Hetman himself, Pavlo Skoropadskyi, to the Regency Council! \n\nIn their opinion, no one other than Hetman deserves to become the new monarch of Ukraine. He comes from a Cossack lineage and his ancestors ruled this land. In addition, the state built in Ukraine was the Skoropadskyi’s achievement, and the appointment of a new Austrian king will further deepen the division of the elites and the people. \n\nThe Hetman himself, however, has not yet stated that he definitely agrees to this proposal. He said that his son, Hetmanych Danylo, was also worthy of receiving the throne, and that he is also a true Ukrainian and son of his homeland."
ukrpol.118.a: "Isn't he the only true leader?"

ukrpol.119.t: "Anti-Russophile Coup!"
ukrpol.119.d: "Hetman has always been a Russophile. This is a truth that neither his words nor his policies will change. Throughout practically his entire reign, Hetman repeatedly asserted that Ukraine is and will be independent, conducted Ukrainization, and all of his reforms were for the benefit of the Ukrainian people. However, this could not change the fact that his regime supported the Russophiles - Protofis and VSZV in every possible way. Finally, after the fall of the German markets, the uprising of the Dyrektoria, albeit a failure, Hetman directed his resources to a more reliable, in his eyes, partnership - with the bear rising from the ruins in the east. But his efforts were in vain, no matter how they would have ended, for the bear would still have attacked and taken back what he considered his own.\n\nA separate hotbed of Russophilia was the armed forces-where generals who had served the Empire for years had never been able to disassociate themselves from their past. That is why today, with the support of the Sich Striltsi, the general staff was disarmed and arrested, and the Hetman himself, who was in his personal residence, was taken by surprise by the armed men who arrested him. Under the sights of Mausers the Hetman was forced to sign a statement of his own abdication; it soon became known that Hetmanych, who had unfortunately been in Kyiv today, has also been arrested and renounced his right of succession. This is the end of the Skoropadskyi dynasty, but who was the beneficiary of this dastardly, according to some, crime against Ukraine?\n\nAnd we will answer you: the Ukrainian people, from the Carpathians to the Caucasus, all of them, one and indivisible, have now overcome the power and arbitrariness of the big bourgeoisie and Russophiles, who want to sell their homeland for 30 pieces of silver. But who will take the \"throne\" now?"

Ten years ago, the Hetman's government drew up a controversial land reform plan that was deemed too moderate by the USKhD conservatives and too radical by landowning lobbyists - in hindsight, it was clear from the beginning that it would not succeed.

Otaman-Minister, along with most in the Council of Ministers, have encouraged the Hetman to sack the main representative of the Protofis assembly, as well as the principal official tied to Great Landowner Faction in the Union of Landowners, Borys Butenko, from the cabinet. They argue that economic policies brought about from ties to Protofis and the Union resulted in the crisis and the revolt that came with it, and that the presence of such a lobby contradicts the vision of the new Hetmanate the SHD is trying to build.\n\nButenko, speaking on behalf of VSZV and Protofis, has defended their position by citing the economic growth brought to the country and crediting the rapport between the alliance and the government as the main reason for Ukraine's economy being one of the largest in the Reichspakt.

ukrpol.130.t: "Abolition of Crimean Autonomy"
ukrpol.130.d: "Today, with approval from Otaman-Minister [GetSecondInCommand] and the Hetman, Crimea's autonomous status has been revoked. The decision - unusually, not a unanimous one - is the latest in a series of administrative reforms aimed at centralising power around the Hetman's government and a move justified by citing bureaucratic bloat and systemic inefficiencies in the Crimean government. For those building the new vision of a Hetmanate, such legal barriers can no longer be allowed to stand - if a law does not serve the needs of a rational and efficient state, then it must be set aside.\nThe decision has been a highly contentious one. During the deliberations, it was brought up repeatedly among the Council of Ministers that revoking Crimea's autonomy could have serious consequences and lead to separatism - the demographics of Crimea are remarkably mixed, consisting of Ukrainians, Tatars, as well as ethnic Russians and Russophones, many of whom have greatly appreciated the autonomy that had previously been granted to them. Indeed, the autonomy of Crimea was arguably instrumental to their accession into the Ukrainian State to begin with - and now that it's gone, the local popular reaction has been resoundingly negative.\n\nA solution was quickly found in the previous head of the Crimean government, Suleiman Sulkeyvych, who the council made a proposal to appoint as the Crimean Representative in the Council of Ministers. While he would not have the supreme veto over Crimean affairs that he once did, his presence and influence would give him a large voice in handling the government of Crimea, second only to the Otaman-Minister and the Hetman. Although not a particularly popular politician, Sulkeyvych's words carry great weight among the Crimean people, and his reassurances to the people have brought a degree of calm to the public outcry.\n\nNot long after the signing of the bill into law, Russia's foreign minister spoke of the move, accusing the government of oppressing ethnic Russians and Russian speakers and of imagined Ukrainian \"atrocities\". Foreign minister Adam Montrezor responded by stating that there is no such intention, reiterating that the move was to streamline the administration, not to oppress Russians, and further decried Russia as attempting to stir separatism."
ukrpol.130.a: "It was to be expected."

ukrpol.131.t: "Establishment of Hereditary Rule"
ukrpol.131.d: "Ever since the Hetman's coming to power in 1918, the lineage of the Hetmanship was not established. Though it has been common knowledge that if Pavlo Skoropadskyi were to pass away, his son Danylo would take the position of Hetman, it has never been enshrined into law. With sufficient support among the Council of Ministers, as well as the tacit acknowledgement of Skoropadskyi's age, this law is finally to be passed.\n\nOne question, however, remains. During the debate on the law, Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia argued that the appointment of the Hetman's heir should be confirmed by the Great Cossack Rada. Given the influence of the Great Cossack Rada, it could be argued that this would add legitimacy to the succession, but some are pointing it out as just another power grab by Poltavets-Ostrianytsia."

ukrpol.132.t: "Hetmanych of Ukraine With Royal Visit"
ukrpol.132.d: "A high-ranking guest from Eastern Europe, Hetmanych Danylo Skoropadskyi, heir to the Ukrainian throne, arrived in Canada this week as an official representative of the Ukrainian monarchy. \n\nThere are over 200,000 Ukrainians living in Canada, having emigrated mostly since 1895 and creating a large diaspora. The influx of emigrants intensified after the conclusion of the Weltkrieg: Ukrainians were leaving the war- and revolution-devastated lands of Austria and the former Russian Empire.\n\nDespite Hetmanych's nobility, [ROOT.GetLeader] did not have time to receive him, but he was received by our Minister of Foreign Affairs with a short visit. Subsequently, Hetmanych spent most of his time in the small villages and towns of Canada where Ukrainians live, gaining unprecedented popularity among the local population and greatly fuelling the Ukrainians' intention to return to their homeland. \n\nWho knows, perhaps in the future, when Hetmanych becomes Hetman, Canada and Ukraine will establish good relations."
ukrpol.132.a: "Great, considering our sizeable Ukrainian diaspora!"

ukrpol.133.t: "Hetmanych Visits Canada!"
ukrpol.133.d: "One important foreign policy event this year was Hetmanych of Ukraine Danylo Skoropadskyi’s visit to [CAN.GetName], home to two hundred thousand Ukrainians.\nThe mass resettlement of Ukrainians in Canada began in the late 19th century, when the Canadian government actively encouraged large-scale emigration from Eastern Europe. The initiator of the mass migration of Ukrainians to Canada is said to be Yosyp Oleskov: he visited Canada in 1895 and was fascinated by its possibilities for agricultural development. His public lectures and his pamphlets \"On Free Land\" and \"On Emigration\" encouraged many peasants, mainly from Galicia, Bukovina, and Transcarpathia, to migrate to the large expanses of Canada. Until the beginning of the Weltkrieg, over 170,000 Ukrainians had left for Canada. After the end of the Weltkrieg, mass emigration continued: Ukrainians left the war-torn and revolution-ravaged lands of Austria and the former Russian Empire.\n\nHetmanych's visit to Canada is an important and symbolic step for many Ukrainians living there, who rarely hear about their homeland, only snippets from newspapers and few radio broadcasts. Nevertheless, emigrants have formed a number of unions on a Conservative Hetmanist basis, growing from educational and sporting communities and clubs into full-fledged organizations. The largest of these, the 'Soiuz Hetmantsiv-Derzhavnykiv u Pivnichnii Amerytsi' ('Union of Hetmanists-Derzhavnyks in North America'), was formed from a similar society formerly known as the Canadian Sich Organization.\n\nHetmanych met with the leader of the SHDPA, Volodymyr Bosyi, and visited some of the largest villages and towns of Ukrainians in Canada, gaining unprecedented popularity among emigrants and promising to return again."

ukrpol.134.d: "Although previously part of the Hetman's coalition, the USKhD fell out of favour with the Hetman after he focused his efforts on stregthening his own personal power. Nonetheless, the USKhD may be useful - while they do not share opinions on most things with the SHD, they do agree with some of its most important tenets, most notably the doctrine of Ukrainian Conservatism and suppression of the leftists.\n\nIn any case, the USKhD could be brought to the SHD's side, which would surely work towards the expansion of the SHD as a mass organisation. Opinions vary on to what extent we should attempt to absorb the willing members of this organisation; should we seek to bring them to our cause at any cost, or is the effort not worth potentially making the SHD a disunited organisation?"

When Black Monday hit Ukraine and the country was thrown into civil war months later, the small, yet influential movement believed they could have taken advantage of the turmoil and become the dominant organisation in the Hetman's coalition. Some have gone as far to say that Skoropadskyi once planned on appointing Serhii Shemet, the leader of the organisation, due to his personal closeness with the Hetman.\n\nLately, the already small organisation's membership has dwindled owing to the SHD's efforts to bring them into the government. Many of the less ideologically inclined and more pragmatic members of the organisation flocked to the SHD. With these developments, Mykola Kochubei, the main ideologue of the USKhD, has opted to dissolve the organisation, owing to its insignificant membership and lack of funding and support. In its place, Kochubei and the movement's most influential thinkers have rebranded the movement to the \"Brotherhood of Classocrats-Monarchists\", more accurately representing their main ideas. The new organisation, however, is small and politically irrelevant, and is doubted to make any headway soon, as the SHD continues its consolidation over the Ukrainian political scene."

Years ago, such a meeting would be between close political allies - now, it was between the fiercest of rivals.\n\nHomzyn had remembered the days of the Anti-Hetman Revolt. A tragedy, one that had Ukrainian turn against each other as radicals sought to tear the nation apart. But it was also an opportunity, one where Hetman Skoropadskyi realised the wiseness of the SHD - and by then, ejecting Doroshenko out of office was only a formality. Was that all Homzyn himself was now? Just a formality?\n\nPoltavets-Ostrianytsia informed Homzyn in no uncertain terms that the government and key city structures were under the control of cossack detachments, and that the Hetman was being held in protective custody to protect him from \"all possible harm\". The message was clear: that he must resign as soon as possible, or he will be detained as a person suspected in conspiracy and high treason against the Hetman's will.\n\nLater that morning, the Hetman made a historic radio address: Homzyn, citing poor health incompatible with his current burden of responsibilities, was granted resignation.

Most of the UPSS, including Oleksandr Shapoval, would likely support Danylo, despite their opinion of the Hetman, as they believe he will weaken Ukrainian dependence on the Reichspakt by virtue of his lack of royal ties with the European dynasties. Leo Stefan is not really supported by the other half: instead general Hrekiv is likely to oppose any sort of foreign monarchy in Ukraine or even monarchy itself. In this case, however, he'd likely to support Danylo Skoropadskyi. Finally, Petro Bolbochan is a staunch supporter of King Vasyl since he first met him, but really he is not very fond of somebody other becoming Ukrainian sovereign.

According to Lypynskyi’s conception of Ukrainian conservatism, it is the Hetman who should be the leader of the country, despite being restricted by the Constitution and Parliament. However, by agreement of Austria, Germany, and Ukraine, Vasyl was crowned as king. It is therefore proposed that the Kingdom be immediately renamed Hetmanate, as is the proclamation of Vasyl as Hetman of All Ukraine, and his successor as Hetmanich. \nIn addition, it is proposed that the succession to the throne, and the rights of the heirs of Hetmanich to the throne of Ukraine, be secured by a special law."

As Lypynskyi stated, \"The Cossacks are a personal dignity that is not inherited.\"\n\nThe Assembly of the Ukrainian Cossacks will soon form its own governing bodies according to the territorial principle, which are subordinate to the Great Cossack Rada under the Hetman. The motto of the Ukrainian Cossacks was as well established: \"God–Hetman–Ukraine!\""

ukrpol.171.d: "Due to Zalozetskyi-Sas's more liberal stance in the eyes of the USKhD’s leader, Lypynskyi and overall approval of these actions by the [GetUKRTitle], the announcement of the new royal coalition with the liberal parties has brought much attention and were discussed by Lypynskyi and his closest allies. In their eyes, such circumstances can lead to overall instability in Ukraine, and, therefore, they have publicly discredited Zalozetskyi-Sas and his supporters.\n\nIn the past, the USKhD has once outlived the similar schism with Skoropadskyi leaving the party to form his own - SHD. However, that time, it was Lypynskyi on the 'liberal' side of the split.\n\nNevertheless, the decision of the Party Congress to cancel membership of Zalozetskyi-Sas and his supporters has led to a significant scandal and even a political crisis. While the Prime-Minister has denounced this decision, he has now been working on establishing a new political faction in the [GetUkrainianParliamentFullName], later to be established in a completely new party. Receiving the name of UMP (Ukrainian Monarchist Party), the new governing organisation has already begun the work to establish itself as a separate from the USKhD political entity."

In terms of the basic tenets of Khliborobov-Derzhavnikov, these people are not only traitors to the party, they are traitors to the whole country, because they contributed to the fact that Ukraine is still suffering from the consequences of Skoropadskyi's dictatorship.\n\nThis view, however, is disputed by a number of political figures. In particular, they feel some pity for former party members and insist that now that the Hetman has been overthrown and expelled, work must begin to reintegrate former party members and unify the entire Hetman movement."

Despite a number of concessions that the Hetman made to Ukraine, they were imposed on him by Germany and Austria-Hungary. Now that Hetman has been forced to abdicate his Hetmanship, Ukraine needs constitutional reform.\n\nTherefore, at Lypynskyi’s insistence, a committee was established to review the constitution. It is to consider in the near future the main questions to be changed.\n\nThe decisions made will form the basis of new constitutional amendments and should finally change Ukraine for the better, according to the principles of Khliborobs-Derzhavnyks"

Particular attention was paid to Serhiy Shemet, a longtime associate of Lypynskyi, who remained a member of the party all these years, but he also maintained ties with Skoropadskyi.\n\nSerhiy Shemet was also critical of some party principles: for example, he was rather negative about Lypynskyi’s idealistic ideas and believed that the party needed to become more 'down-to-earth' - and pursue a realistic and pragmatic policy. His ideas served as the basis for the article \"Praktichna Politika\" published a couple of years ago in Lypynskyi’s journal.\n\nNow the question arises whether Shemet should be trusted, or whether his connections with Skoropadskyi would completely discredit him."

The party was ideologically close to our current party, and got its name on Lypynskyi’s initiative, and was based on his platform of Ukrainian Conservatism.\n\nThat program in the name of Ukraine's independence was inferior to the ideas of monarchism, and was much more democratic than Lypynskyi’s Hetmanist Nationalism - more focused on classocratic principles, which formed the basis of the current USKhD.\n\nOn the initiative of Serhiy Shemet, the party congress raised the question of an ideological return to the principles of the UDKhP - the unification of the entire hetman movement into a single national front for the development of the Ukrainian state and a retreat from the authoritarian principles laid down by Lypynskyi."

It paid tribute to the epoch by its name, but was formed from the members of the Ukrainian Democratic-Radical Party and the Association of Ukrainian Progressives, which had passed into the pages of history. The members of the new party belonged to the liberal-democratic intelligentsia, engaged in national-cultural work and were the best professionals in their field among all parties at that time. Rather moderate socialists and supporters of world federalism and a decentralized administrative structure, the SFs were part of the Hetman government, which led to a pronounced split in the party but not in program, but in strategy.\n\nThe era of the Ukrainian Revolution put members of the same party on different sides of the barricades. The Hetman's supporters became known as the USPF (Mistsevi) - under the leadership of Doroshenko they remained in the Hetmanate and participated in all governments. The faction of Yefremov, Nikovskyi and Shulhyn changed their name to Ukrainian Liberal-Democrats and participated in the creation of the Dyrektoria - although cooperation with openly socialist parties was difficult and rather a strategic decision.\n\nDespite the split, the factions maintained cordial relations, and after the Dyrektoria Revolution, Doroshenko's supporters rejoined their confederates, ready to pursue a dream of a liberal-democratic Ukraine."

The police, on duty in the streets of Ukrainian cities, guard the peace and quiet of our citizens and restore order after the reign of anarchy. Even some of the large landowners and businesses that fled the country after Hetman have returned, following the news of the restoration of private property rights. Ukrainian peasants and peasant farmers, though still feeling the consequences of the agricultural crisis, are calmly cultivating their land, although under the strain of the existing bread monopoly. \n\nUkraine is returning, albeit slowly and timidly, but to the prosperity once promised by the Hetman regime, which condemned everyone to terrible consequences. Now free Ukraine is on the path of true democracy. And although there is much to do and many obstacles to overcome, there is one indispensable feeling, almost imperceptible, but clearly evident, and which most Ukrainians so far, whether afraid or confused, after centuries of oppression and slavery - Freedom. How it permeates the air, the water, the sky, the Ukrainian fields. Freedom is everywhere and in everything, and filling the entire atmosphere, freedom rushes towards its true goal.

While in exile in Galicia, he founded the publishing house \"Ukrainian Autocephalous Church\", actively cooperated with the Uniate Church, and regularly published his works.

A few days ago Ivan Ohienko gave his farewell address as minister, and today, he resigned and was tonsured into monasticism with the name Ilarion at St. George's Cathedral in Kamyanets-Podilskyi.

Nevertheless, the government is seriously prepared to consider projects to modernize the system and create a new parliament modeled on the European powers.\n\nA total of 3 projects have been submitted to the reform commission for consideration. The first of them is a model parliament on the basis of the Swedish Riksdag. 'Derzhavna Rada' will be bicameral, consisting of a chamber of deputies and a chamber of land assemblies. The upper house will consist of representatives of regions and city councils, elected indirectly.\nThe second option is based on the Swiss Federal Assembly, also a bicameral parliament. The seats in the lower house, the 'Natsionalna Rada', would be allocated in proportion to the population of the regions, and in the 'Rada Zemel' each region would get two mandates, which would ensure equality of voters and regions.\nFinally, the last proposed option is the model of the Dutch Parliament - bicameral, where deputies will be elected to the lower Palata Predstavnykiv in general elections for 5 years, and the upper House - the 'Senat Respubliky', where deputies will be elected for 4 years on the basis of sheets submitted by the regions.\n\nEach model has its own characteristics, but building a new legislative system in line with leading European standards will help us build a stable political system and strengthen the freedoms of citizens."

This was especially realized when the armed Derzhavna Varta broke into Hrekiv's office and arrested him for treason and attempted coup d'etat.\n\nThe elderly general was led out of his office at gunpoint and Mausers, and then taken to court, where the judge ordered that he be placed in a pre-trial detention center.\n\nAt the same time, the head office of Batkivschyna in Kyiv was being ransacked - HQ staff officer Ivan Andrushchenko and Colonel Borys Khoslovskyi, who was there, were arrested. There were also reports of the arrests of the chairman of the Kharkiv branch of the society, Mytrofan Popsui-Shapka, and of the Melitopol branch, Tryhubiv-Pasynok. \n\nAround the same time, it became clear that General Bolbochan was behind the arrests, who was able to convince the third triumvir, Oleksandr Shapoval, of the illegality of Hrekiv's actions and the inadmissibility of ultimatums. The King had already noted Bolbochan's steadfastness and loyalty to the oath given to him and expressed his confidence that the conflicts would be resolved democratically."

ukrpol.235.d: "Forced to leave the Ukrainian throne, where Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen was better known as King Vasyl, now expressed his desire to join our armed forces. The commander of the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen during the First Weltkrieg, Wilhelm is not the most talented military leader, but it is possible that he is worthy to serve our country."

ukrpol.236.d: "The Austrian goverment was outraged by the fact that their Willy von Habsburg was forced to flee the foreign country. However, we actually had not threatened him with anything and it was his choice to leave his throne and escape the country. So, we can do nothing with it."
ukrpol.236.a: "He left the throne without notice, not our problem..."

ukrpol.237.t: "[FROM.GetName] Pressures Our Government!"
ukrpol.237.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has seriously condemned what they call 'putsch' and pressures our government because of Willy von Habsburg fleeing the foreign country. However, we actually have nothing to do with his sudden escape."
ukrpol.237.a: "They have nothing to do with it..."

ukrpol.238.t: "[FROM.GetName] Expressed Deep Concern"
ukrpol.238.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has rather weakly reacted to the member of the Habsburg royal family leaving Ukraine all in a sudden and therefore no longer being the head of Ukrainian state. However, we have nothing to do with his sudden escape."
ukrpol.238.a: "Pathetic..."

ukrpol.239.t: "[FROM.GetName] Supports Our Government"
ukrpol.239.d: "Suddenly, the German government has supported our government and reminded that as part of their alliance, not their colonial subject, we have the right to elect whatever government we can. Therefore, they don't see us as illegitimate government, neither do they accept Vasyl's claims to the throne since he himself escaped the country when 'he was in no danger'."
ukrpol.239.a: "Surprising."

ukrpol.240.t: "Ukraine Left Our Demands Unanswered"
ukrpol.240.d: "The Ukrainian government has simply ignored our rightful demands to re-establish legal order in the country. While we cannot directly attack the ally of the German Empire, we will now have to cope with the new affairs, while definetely that means that Ukraine is no longer considered a reliable partner of us."
ukrpol.240.a: "How dare they!"
ukrpol.240.b: "Establish a Kronland of Eastern Galicia with Vasyl as its head!"

ukrpol.241.t: "The Austrian Response"
ukrpol.241.d: "The Austrians have treacherously established the 'Kronland' in our rightful lands. Having paid no concern to the Ukrainians leaving in their country, they have no all of a sudden established the Crownland of East Galicia with our ex-monarch Vasyl as its head. While they may have outplayed us in this diplomatic warfare, we will certainly have our say by ending our relations with Austria and eventually annexing our rightful Galician lands!"
ukrpol.241.a: "They offered us the right to their land in their own hand!"

ukrpol.242.t: "Seeking Compromise With the Red Prince"
ukrpol.242.d: "Although many believe that King Vasyl was the viceroy of the Germans, this is not entirely true. Vasyl played an important role in the Ukrainian Revolution, where he took an active part in the command of some groups of troops, in particular through which he developed close contacts with General Bolbochan, who became his staunch supporter. Nevertheless, the question of Vasyl's coronation as Sovereign of Ukraine was not resolved until 1927, when under the Austro-German Compromise, Ukraine became a kingdom headed by Vasyl. \n\nDespite his largely symbolic role, Vasyl tried to take an active part in politics: in particular, with his direct support, there existed parties in opposition to Hetman, including the UPSS. \n\nNevertheless, a compromise must be found with the \"Red Prince\" and his non-interference in Ukrainian affairs for as long as he is on the throne must be ensured. His responsibilities should be strictly limited and his influence on politics minimal. The main proponent of such a solution is General Bolbochan, who resists the opinion of other party members to abolish the monarchy.\n\nIt seems that the decision has been made, and now it is just a matter of approving the status quo and negotiating with the king."
ukrpol.242.a: "Ukraine shall remain a monarchy."

This was especially realized when the armed Derzhavna Varta broke into Hrekiv's office and arrested him for treason and attempted coup d'etat.\n\nThe elderly general was led out of his office at gunpoint and Mausers, and then taken to court, where the judge ordered that he be placed in a pre-trial detention center.\n\nAt the same time, the head office of Batkivschyna in Kyiv was being ransacked - HQ staff officer Ivan Andrushchenko and Colonel Borys Khoslovskyi, who was there, were arrested.

ukrpol.244.t: "Crisis In The Triumvirate"
ukrpol.244.d: "The triumvirate that has been in place for several months has largely held on to its common goal of preserving stability within the country and preventing the collapse of Ukrainian statehood. At least that is what the official representatives said.\n\nBut by now it has become clear that different ideological platforms, political ambitions, etc. have contributed to the fact that the Triumvirate is bursting at the seams.\n\nSoon there were rumors that the Triumvirate was going to lift the state of emergency and elect a new legitimate government. However, it is not yet known who will lead this government."
ukrpol.244.a: "The Triumvirate shall end its duty in a week."

ukrpol.245.t: "The King Appoints Bolbochan"
ukrpol.245.d: "A couple of days ago it was revealed that the Triumvirate had officially ended its existence largely due to controversy within it. The main intrigue for Ukrainians, however, was who would lead the new government.\n\nToday, however, it has become known that the King has appointed a new Otaman-Minister, or head of government, in the person of General Petro Bolbochan. An ardent associate of Vasyl, Bolbochan has built his career in independent Ukraine on the support of royalty and has contributed greatly to the support of Vyshyvanyi among the UPSS.\nNow, apparently, the king repaid Bolbochan in full, and instructed him to form and lead a new government, after which to restore democratic processes within the country."
ukrpol.245.a: "Glory to the King and Petro Bolbochan!"

ukrpol.246.t: "The Triumvirate Dissolves, Elections In A Year"
ukrpol.246.d: "A couple of days ago it was revealed that the Triumvirate had officially ended its existence largely due to controversy within it. The main intrigue for Ukrainians, however, was who would lead the new government.\n\nAlready today it became known that the Triumvirate was officially dissolved and Oleksandr Shapoval, a representative of the conservative trend within the UPSS, was reappointed as the formal head of government. However, his candidacy is not final. \n\nIn the near future, the UPSS should meet at a party congress and finally confirm its ideological platform. In the event that the positions of the right-wing socialists within the party prevail, it is likely that the congress will elect a more leftist leader - Opanas Andriyevskyi"
ukrpol.246.a: "Democracy is returning back to Ukraine."

ukrpol.247.t: "General Hrekiv Overthrows the Triumvirate"
ukrpol.247.d: "A couple of days ago it was revealed that the Triumvirate had officially ended its existence largely due to controversy within it. The main intrigue for Ukrainians, however, was who would lead the new government.\n\nToday, however, the Ukrainian capital woke up to the sound of gunfire. Officers from the Batkivshchyna comradeship, led by General Hrekiv, arrested what was left of the Triumvirate. The justification for this action was personal accusations by Oleksandr Shapoval of trying to re-establish ties with the Hetman movement and return the Skoropadskyis, represented by Hetmanych Danylo, to the Ukrainian throne. Although these accusations have some justification, on the whole, what happened is unequivocally characterized as a coup d'état.\n\nGeneral Hrekiv, now in charge of the country, promises social justice and equality, as well as the strengthening of the country's defense in the name of its sovereignty. So far, the newspapers have not been very positive, but who knows, maybe a Hrekiv's firm hand will put an end to the instability in Ukrainian politics?"

ukrpol.249.d: "The congress of the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Independentists was held today to adopt a new program of the party, the first since 1920. The main contradictions consist of a misunderstanding of the path the party should take in the future. \n\nA number of supporters of the socialist platform argue that Ukraine should go the socialist way, as the party name implies, while they do not lose sight of the national-patriotic ideology. Supporters of this platform are united around one of the party's leaders, Opanas Andriyevskyi.\n\nOn the other hand, they are opposed by supporters of the conservative platform, who stand on a rigid anti-socialist platform close to the positions of Mikhnovskyi and Lypynskyi, that is, the Hetman movement. Their leader, Oleksandr Shapoval, also has a great chance of success in becoming the official leader of the party."

According to preliminary estimates, up to a thousand people could have been killed in the clashes, mostly from the population, and the Dyrektoria has already dubbed the event a \"Massacre\"."

In the capital of Ukraine, the rebels erected barricades and the townspeople heard incessant gunfire all day long.

This time the terrorist was captured alive and will soon face a tribunal, since most of the UVO members are Ukrainian officers. Some politicians are already calling for a complete ban of the UVO in Ukraine, forcible disarmament of all troops where the UVO may have a significant influence, and mass arrests of those involved. In particular, Dmytro Dontzov, who was hiding from justice in his native Melitopol, has already been arrested and sent to the detention center, where he was detained and immediately taken to court."

Despite the fact that Batkivshchyna is also a military organization, its activities are not limited to this, and this particular unit was engaged in cooperative affairs. In other words, UVO terrorists attacked the food store, destroying everyone who was there at that moment, as well as the supplies themselves, putting the population at risk of receiving their services.

As it turned out, this organization made purchases of food at understated prices, in connection with which the civil administration suspected criminal intent and fraud on a large scale, given that the price was almost 7 times lower than the market price.\n\nHowever, as Hrekiv himself said, first of all, in troubled times he needed to provide food to his comrades-in-arms, and these were the conditions of the deal and there could be no corruption here. At the same time, however, he denied his involvement, saying that in the regions the local bosses are in charge of Batkivshchyna's affairs."

Despite the fact that thanks to Bolbochan's courage and strategic foresight, the UNR troops were able to seize the Crimea almost bloodlessly and in a few days, the Hetman government officially hushed up this heroic deed, as the German government eventually occupied the peninsula and drove Bolbochan out of there.\n\nThe Crimean operation contributed greatly to the further annexation of Crimea to Ukraine, and now the historical community has attempted to shed light on the true event and extol Bolbochan's role in this event.

This problem is particularly acute in Melitopol, in southern Ukraine, where large cities such as [200.Owner.GetVictoryPointName_11405], Berdiansk, and Kherson are located in the neighborhood. The propaganda of Russophile views spreading among the workers who came from Russia and settled in these cities is still strong. \n\nIn this regard, Batkivshchyna is asking the government for a grant for its activities, but a number of ministers, including Shapoval and Bolbochan, fear that the money could be spent by Hrekiv to strengthen his own position."

Now that the Dyrektoria had begun active resistance activities, the loyalty of a number of high-ranking officers of the General Staff came into question, prompting mass arrests. Also procedural aspects and checks on the activities of these officers for treason, espionage in favor of the enemy, etc., began.

While we have no access to these forests, we have already reported about the incident to the [91.Owner.GetAdjective] government. No signs of UVO presence have been identified yet, unfortunately.

ukrsun.24.d: "Today the school for Ukrainian children started differently. Teacher opened a small book called ‘Principles of Ukrainian nationalism’, and started reading to the class — ordering everyone to note every word and learn every word of it.\n\nI am the Spirit of the eternal element, who saved you from the Tatar flood and put you on the edge of two worlds to create a new life:\n\n1. You will win the Ukrainian State, or you will die fighting for it.\n2. You will not allow anyone to tarnish the glory or honor of Your Nation.\n3. Remember the great days of our liberation fights.\n4. Be proud of the fact that You are the heir of the struggle for the glory of the Vladimir Trident.\n5. To avenge the death of the Great Knights.\n6. Do not talk about the case, with whom you can, but with whom you must.\n7. Do not hesitate to perform the most dangerous act if the good of the cause requires it.\n8. You will receive the enemies of Your Nation with hatred and ruthless struggle.\n9. Neither requests, nor threats, nor torture, nor death will compel you to reveal secrets.\n10. You will fight to strengthen the strength, glory, wealth and space of the Ukrainian State.\n\nStudents read it in unison as a prayer, and the ones who refused — were beaten. A new routine was born — every day, students were reading Decalogue before the studying started. It was seen as disrespectful to the nation not to know it."

### Dyrektoria and Socialists ###

ukrsoc.1.t: "Victory of the People’s Republic!"
ukrsoc.1.d: "After the capture of Kyiv, the defense of the so-called "Kingdom" fell apart. Soldiers began to defect en masse to our side, realizing our superiority, and some commanders surrendered. Control of Kyiv meant control of the railroad, and our partisans in the south, in conjunction with the Borotbysts, were able to quickly capture key industrial centers.\n\nThe Hetman government managed to escape from Kyiv and found refuge abroad, but along with the German puppets we drove out the Germans themselves. Now Ukraine is truly a people’s republic where people’s power will rule. However, for this to happen, an All-Ukrainian Constituent Congress must be convened."
ukrsoc.1.a: "We should immediately hold All-Ukrainian Congress!"

ukrsoc.2.t: "Anarchy on the Streets"
ukrsoc.2.d: "Despite our victory, we cannot yet say that our power is strong. There is anarchy and looting in many cities. The poor rob the rich, the peasants steal from the landlords. The situation is clearly beyond our control. \n\nSymon Petliura, Otaman of the UNR Army, concurrently Minister of War of the Dyrektoria, proposed the immediate creation of a people’s militia in order to bring the situation in the cities back under the control of the central government. However, many believe that this would only strengthen his authority and that the creation of a militia loyal to and under Petliura’s control might play into his hands."
ukrsoc.2.a: "Whatever, we need to call a congress"
ukrsoc.2.b: "Form the people’s militia to deal with the chaos"

ukrsoc.3.t: "Borotbysts Sabotage the Plants"
ukrsoc.3.d: "The Borotbysts, who were not formally part of the Dyrektoria, began sabotaging the work of the factories, demanding decisive measures from our still-unstable provisional government to improve the lives of workers. Despite the fact that their main electorate is peasants, workers are also under the influence of the Borotbysts. \n\nOleksandr Shumskyi spoke at a rally in Kharkiv, where he stated that until the Directorate takes measures to protect workers' rights, our people’s government is not at all popular, but reactionary and bourgeois. Minister of War Petliura suggested that the strikes be dealt with immediately, that the workers be dispersed, and that we should not wait for the decrees of the legally elected All-Ukrainian Congress."
ukrsoc.3.a: "We can't wait anymore, a congress should be held!"
ukrsoc.3.b: "Petliurivtsi shall restore the work on the plants"

ukrsoc.4.t: "Last Monarchist Resistance in Poltava"
ukrsoc.4.d: "In Poltava, the region which is considered the most conservative"
ukrsoc.4.a: "They will calm down eventually, call a congress!"
ukrsoc.4.b: "Calm the Poltava turmoul!"

ukrsoc.5.t: "Rampant Crime in Odesa"
ukrsoc.5.d: "With the departure of the German garrison from Odesa, the situation there became somewhat heated, especially with regard to rampant crime. Nevertheless, the hetman’s oprichniks maintained some order in the city. However, with both of them fleeing and with insufficient control over the city, Odesa experienced a true flowering of criminality and anarchy, stronger than in other cities. \n\nRobbery, looting, and corruption have taken off with renewed vigor, and the local militia of the People’s Republic clearly lacks the strength to suppress it. Petliura addressed a meeting of the Dyrektoria, demanding that troops be immediately sent to Odesa and that all those involved in the looting be arrested, in effect hinting at a curfew and the arrest of anyone who fell under suspicion. This is a very risky step that we cannot take without losing the support of the people."
ukrsoc.5.a: "It’s not a hindrance to the Congress"
ukrsoc.5.b: "Arrest all those involved!" 

ukrsoc.6.t: "Dismissal of the Monarchist Officials"
ukrsoc.6.d: "One of the controversial decisions that must be made as a matter of urgency is the dismissal of all officials who collaborated with the hetman’s regime. \n\nAlthough many in the Dyrektoria are in favor of full lustration, for some this step seems reckless. We can win over to our side the people who have been managing the country for 20 years instead of arresting or firing them all, because unlike the new government, the old apparatus has real work experience."
ukrsoc.6.a: "Dismiss them all!"
ukrsoc.6.b: "We cannot be left without the support of those who have ruled the country for 20 years!"
ukrsoc.6.c: "This should be discussed at the Congress"

ukrsoc.7.t: "Question of the Monarchist Parties"
ukrsoc.7.d: "With the coming of the Dyrektoria to power, the monarchist parties came under attack, to which our government includes all the legal parties that acted in support of the King and the Hetman, namely: UPSS, Lypynskyi’s USKhD, and Skoropadskyi’s SHD.\n\nSome advocate the immediate prohibition of the activity of all counter-revolutionary parties, while others believe that this should be decided at the All-Ukrainian Congress within the framework of the people’s power."
ukrsoc.7.a: "They should be banned!"
ukrsoc.7.b: "The Congress should decide this"

ukrsoc.8.t: "Business is Fleeing the Country!"
ukrsoc.8.d: "The uprising of the Dyrektoria was accompanied not only by increased anarchy and violence throughout the country and mass looting of landed estates, groundless arrests, and a hetmaniacal police force, but also by a more significant factor.\n\nBlack Monday and the crisis that followed brought us to an almost complete economic collapse. Most frightening of all, business is fleeing the country - young and mature entrepreneurs are trying to take time to move their assets to nearby countries still open to them. This is accompanied by a massive brain and personnel drain; in fact, the country is being deprived of its future. Of course, many enterprises have already been nationalized, and in some cases expropriated by the new people's state, but the loss of initiative and entrepreneurial spirit among our citizens may have an effect on our future."
ukrsoc.8.a: "Catastrophic."

ukrsoc.9.t: "The First Day of the Congress"
ukrsoc.9.d: "It was time for the Congress to be called. In many regions of Ukraine, the active creation of local government bodies has already begun, particularly Soviets and Radas, through which various politicians, organizations, and parties plan to make their way to the All-Ukrainian Congress and participate in the legislation of vital and defining bills, as well as vote for the composition of the government."
ukrsoc.9.a: "Let us begin..."
ukrsoc.9.b: "Petliura dissolves the assembly with the help of army"

ukrsoc.10.t: "Controversy in the Poltava Village Council"
ukrsoc.10.d: "In Poltava, which before the Dyrektoria came to power was considered the bastion of the reactionaries and the main stronghold of the Hetman movement, new realities set in. In a village in the Poltavshchyna the situation reached a deadlock. The local council was actually divided 50-50 over which delegates they would support at the All-Ukrainian Congress. \n\nOn the one hand, the position of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who promise land to the peasants, which is especially important for the predominantly agrarian region of Poltava, is quite strong. On the other hand, the positions of the Ukapists, whose program is aimed not only at the peasants, but also at the workers, are not inferior to the SRs’ one. For the ordinary inhabitants of this small village, this issue proved vital, but it could hardly influence the outcome of the All-Ukrainian Congress. However, the local Poltava newspapers brought attention to the story, with the result that the outcome of the vote in a single village could also influence the polls of the entire Poltavshchyna..."
ukrsoc.10.a: "Poltava village council supports the UPSR..."
ukrsoc.10.b: "Poltava village council turns to the UKP"

ukrsoc.11.t: "All of the Delegates Arrived"
ukrsoc.11.d: "Finally, from Kyiv comes the joyous news that all the delegates from the councils, local Radas, factory commissioners, and national minorities have arrived at the All-Ukrainian Congress. The congress, which is destined to put an end to the Hetman bourgeoisie, unbridled capitalism and robbery of ordinary Ukrainians. The four main parties of the Dyrektoria: the UKP, the UPSR, the USDRP and the ULD(S-F), will offer their versions of the vision of the Ukrainian future, after which delegates will have to vote for the party whose ideas, in their opinion, are the most worthy."
ukrsoc.11.a: "Future of Ukraine is in our hands"

ukrsoc.12.t: "Administrative Reform"
ukrsoc.12.d: "The administrative-territorial division of the Ukrainian People's Republic was established on March 6, 1918, by the law 'On the administrative-territorial division of Ukraine'. According to it, Ukraine was divided into 32 administrative units of the first order - Zemli (Lands), which, in turn, were divided into Volosts, and Volosts - into Communities. This division existed until Hetman Skoropadskyi came to power and was abolished by him on April 29, 1918, as a result the state was divided into Okruhas (Provinces), following the administrative division of the Russian Empire.\n\nNow that power was once again in the hands of the People's Republic, the question of administrative division was again raised. On the one hand, the current division was outdated and did not allow for effective resolution of local issues; on the other hand, it would not prevent local self-government from organizing itself arbitrarily in a particular province."
ukrsoc.12.a: "We should get rid of the Imperial past."
ukrsoc.12.b: "Current division is just fine."

ukrsoc.13.t: "Borotbysts Boycott the Congress!"
ukrsoc.13.d: "Today, the Central Committee of the UPSR(b), headed by Oleksandr Shumskyi, officially announced a boycott of the elections to the All-Ukrainian Congress, accusing the parties involved of revisionism. However, despite the official statements about the boycott, many of the Borotbyst members supported the UPSR in the elections to the Constituent Congress as their former party-mates and closest ideological allies. "
ukrsoc.13.a: "What are they up to?"

ukrsoc.14.t: "Non-Functioning Plant"
ukrsoc.14.d: "From the moment the Dyrektoria came to power, striking workers flooded the major cities, the strikes paralyzed many factories, and in some cases we can speak of sabotage of production!\n\nHowever, even after some stabilization of society and the economy, many factories throughout the country, including such a massive industrial hub as the Donbas, remain non-functional. This hurts not only our image, but also our economy, production capacity and the industrial potential of our country.\n\nA number of military officials have suggested that workers' strikes should be suppressed and all factories and plants should be brought back into operation immediately, but such an action would be clearly unpopular, though effective. On the other hand, civilian officials from all parties recommend intensified labor propaganda and declarative labor mobilization."
ukrsoc.14.a: "Get the workers to work!"
ukrsoc.14.b: "Promote labour, not violence!"

ukrsoc.15.t: "The Hetman Bureacracy Question"
ukrsoc.15.d: "One of the controversial decisions that must be made as a matter of urgency is the dismissal of all officials who collaborated with the hetman’s regime. \n\nAlthough many in the Dyrektoria are in favor of full lustration, for some this step seems reckless. We can win over to our side the people who have been managing the country for 20 years instead of arresting or firing them all, because unlike the new government, the old apparatus has real work experience."

ukrsoc.16.d: "Question of the Monarchist Parties"
ukrsoc.16.b: "They should be allowed to exist."

ukrsoc.17.t: "A Discussion of Unions"
ukrsoc.17.d: "Particular attention at the congress was paid to the issue of trade unions. Representatives of numerous trade unions, workers' committees, and committees of factory commissioners came to the congress to vote for the party that best serves the interests of the trade unions and the Ukrainian working class.\n\nThree main programs were put on the agenda. The first, from the Ukapists, offers the unions guarantees of independence from the state, and even participation in economic planning along with the Ministry of National Economy. The second, from the Social Democrats mainly welcomes the self-government of the workers, the development of labor forces and social guarantees for the proletariat. Finally, the third, from the Social Revolutionaries, mainly revolves around the idea of the Labor Republic and the Labor Principle, also assumes the participation of the trade unions in the management of the economy and the \"socialization of factories and enterprises\", that is, the transfer to society and its representatives."
ukrsoc.17.a: "UKP wins the unions’ support"
ukrsoc.17.b: "Trade Unions support USDRP position"
ukrsoc.17.c: "The UPSR\nwins the debate by getting the unions on its side"

ukrsoc.18.t: "Bourgeousie and Landlords"
ukrsoc.18.d: "One of the most heated issues of discussion at the congress was the question of landlords, the bourgeoisie, and the deprivation of their electoral rights. The idea supported by the majority of the parties is the immediate alienation of voting rights from the representatives of the capitalist exploiting classes, who have been robbing the common people for the past 20 years under the patronage of Hetman and the foreign military. \n\nOn the other hand, the democratic and socialist character of our new republic, as if to prevent any oppression on the basis of class, for in this way we are likened to our enemies, who are in any case in the minority."
ukrsoc.18.a: "They should be deprived of electoral rights!"
ukrsoc.18.b: "Universal vote is preferable."

ukrsoc.19.t: "Adoption of the V Universal"
ukrsoc.19.d: "One of the most solemn events at the convention was the adoption of the so-called 5th Universal. The previous four Universals represent important milestones in the history of Ukrainian independence, from the creation of a body of representation of the Ukrainian people, to the adoption of autonomy, and finally to independence. Today's jubilee Universal has consolidated the basic provisions adopted by the delegates of the All-Ukrainian Congress and put an end, at least in words, to the bourgeois capitalist system in Ukraine that flourished under the Hetman regime.\n\nThe 5th Universal once again confirmed the unconditional independence of Ukraine and its peoples, the future is now open, and Ukraine is once again gaining strength to confront future threats."
ukrsoc.19.a: "The Ukrainian People’s Republic lives on!"

ukrsoc.21.t: "The Congress Ends"
ukrsoc.21.d: "With the Congress ending in a couple of days, it is time to elect the new government and premier of the People’s Republic. With the main political issues discusses, the majority of the Congress chooses the mandate of..."
ukrsoc.21.a: "Ukapists, the Ukrainian Communist Party."
ukrsoc.21.b: "Vsevolod Holubovych and his SRs."

## Here comes the UKP events ###

ukrsoc.22.t: "Shakhrai and Vynnychenko"
ukrsoc.22.d: "Sitting near the bar table, Shakhrai thinks about all the struggle and decisions that Ukraine awaits, and his role in it.  Bringing the revolution, with Dyrektoria, and with the UKP, getting the party with such different people behind him, he sits to think about all the comrades, who died, fighting against the Whites, the Germans or the Hetmanists. They wouldn’t see what Ukraine will be — the country of the freed proletariat and peasantry, with the human emancipation and cultural renessaince never seen before under the German rule. \nUnexpectedly, the sit near him was taken. He sees the face of the famous writer, politician, the enemy, his political enemy, and, somehow, a pleasant person to speak with in the bar.\n«How it’s going?» — speaks Vynnychenko, starting the long and intresting conversation — a sharp political debate, and a psychological drama, of most famous and important people of Ukrainian politics. After hours of talking, the two started to packing, preparing for another battles of their parties. Feeling the respect to one another, they shaked hands and went to their homes, drunkenly roaming the streets of night Kyiv, only to see each other tomorrow"
ukrsoc.22.a: "Perhaps, a new friendship was born?"

ukrsoc.23.t: "Pan Skoropadskyi ta Tovarish Skorovstanskyi"
ukrsoc.23.d: "Vasyl Shakhrai became known as the People’s Secretary of Military Affairs, one of the authors of the manifesto to the Ukrainian people and one of the leaders of the short-lived Ukrainian People’s Republic of Soviets with its capital in Kharkiv.\n\nSoon after Hetman Skoropadskyi came to power in Kyiv, Shakhrai began writing bantering appeals, signing himself as \"Comrade Skorovstanskyi\", which mocked the Hetman’s last name and hinted that Hetmanist Ukraine was about to rise, but still nothing.\nFor these articles, Shakhrai gained popularity among the common people. Now in power, a new article signed by Comrade Skorovstanskyi was published in the newspaper Molot in which the chauvinistic feudal regime of the Hetman was finally denounced."
ukrsoc.23.a: "Eventually, Hetman got what he deserved"

ukrsoc.24.t: "A Friendly Talk Down Khreshchatyk"
ukrsoc.24.d: "Kyiv was beautiful, as always! There were a lot of people on the streets, busy with their own things, so no one noticed the little bar on Khreshchatyk, the entrance to which was closed. Inside, there was a friendly discussion between Prime Minister Shakhray and the leader of the Ukrainian Social Democrats, Volodymyr Vynnychenko. \n\nThe bar debates become a daily routine for the Vynnychenko and Shakhray, as their favorite place in Kyiv fills up with people, they filling it with political discussions. Vynnychenko, finds a lot of symphaty to the cause of Shakhray, and, it seems, the same goes for his party Left-wing. The idea of unified left party is mentioned briefly by one of them, speaking on the different topic, only a few words, but the idea makes the two to think: what makes us such different after all? With the left seemingly pushing together for a Ukrainian brand of socialism, not compromising class interests of the workers, maybe its a good moment to speak of the united party? Party of all the left, that will represent all the proletariat, not the fraction, and the peasantry too. Vynnychenko and Shakhray will think about this idea all night, overhearing discussions arising in their parties — is it really possible?"
ukrsoc.24.a: "Comrades, is it the time to have a joint congress with the left of USDRP?"
ukrsoc.24.b: "I don’t think its a good idea."

ukrsoc.25.t: "Legacy of Bolshevism"
ukrsoc.25.d: "Mykola Skrypnyk, known as an old Bolshevik among the party, a member of the RSDRP since 1898, also spoke at the congress. Although Skrypnyk expressed hopes of cooperation with the Russian Communists, he very clearly stressed the need for Ukrainian independence and the development of its culture. Skrypnyk declared that Bolshevism is not a curse or the imperialist needs of the great Russian chauvinists, but is the way of the struggle of the proletariat and Ukraine must be freed from the shackles of capital."
ukrsoc.25.a: "Interesting"

ukrsoc.26.t: "The Colonial Problem"
ukrsoc.26.d: "At the congress, one of the prominent figures of the party, its 'left wing', Andriy Richytskyi, gave a report, stating that Ukraine, as a country with a strong tradition of freedom and independence, should lead the anti-colonial struggle of the peoples. In particular, he raised the issue that the Third International does not give a solution to the problem of colonialism and proposes a violent "liberation" from the imperialist shackles of the peoples of Africa. Essentially substituting red imperialism for liberation, the politicians of the Commune cannot offer an effective solution to the colonial question, despite their stated support for the oppressed peoples. It is therefore up to Ukraine, shackled for centuries by three empires, to lead this internationalist struggle."
ukrsoc.26.a: "His words have sense"

ukrsoc.27.t: "Necessity of Ukrainisation"
ukrsoc.27.d: "In his speech, Party Chairman Shakhrai spoke of the need for speedy Ukrainianization and expressed his hopes for an independent Soviet Ukraine. As the creator of the concept of 'national communism', Shakhrai once again stated that the aspiration of the Ukrainian spirit is for Ukrainian independence. He also expressed hopes of creating a unified socialist government and joining a coalition of other socialist parties. Shakhray’s speech was full of optimism and energized the delegates gathered at the congress, many of whom expressed confidence in the course of the party."
ukrsoc.27.a: "Good"

ukrsoc.28.t: "Decision of the IV(I) Congress"
ukrsoc.28.d: "Today in Kyiv was the fourth, but also the first since the Directorate came to power, congress of the Ukrainian Communist Party. During the congress, several prominent delegates gave addresses, and now it will be necessary to adopt the most relevant platform and elect a new party chairman.\n\nIn general, the delegates have three favorites: Andriy Richytskyi and his program of party centralization, economics, and the anti-colonial struggle. Mykola Skrypnyk and his Bolshevist national-oriented program. And also the current chairman, Vasyl Shakhrai and his program of democratic communism and Ukrainianization.\nSoon, the decision of the Congress was announced..."

ukrsoc.28.c: "Shakhrai remains in his position"

ukrsoc.29.t: "The Beginning of Ukrainisation"
ukrsoc.29.d: "Today, along with the reform of education, increased Ukrainianization is beginning. The capitalist and landlord government of Hetman and King failed to organize for 15 years decent conditions for the development of Ukrainian national culture, and now the Communist Party is taking over. Soon the Ukrainian people will be not only the most educated, but also added to their spirit of independence."
ukrsoc.29.a: "Together towards new Ukrainian society!"

ukrsoc.30.t: "Creation of Skrypnykivka"
ukrsoc.30.d: "Today the official spelling of the Ukrainian language, called Skrypnykivka, was adopted by a vote at the All-Ukrainian Spelling Conference. Chairman Skrypnyk personally took part in the creation of the literary spelling, in addition to him, famous Ukrainian linguists and even writers also took part, like Mykola Khvylovyi and Mykola Yalovyi. Linguists from Galicia also took part in the conference.\n\nThe adoption of the new spelling was also responded to in Moscow, where the local government stated that the Ukrainian language is about to be \"artificially separated from the Russian language\". However, the criticism from the Slavic neighbor did not receive much attention, as many linguists on both sides of the argument stated that the language develops naturally and cannot be artificially changed."
ukrsoc.30.a: "Glory to Skrypnykivka"

ukrsoc.31.t: "Ukrainian Futurist Exhibition"
ukrsoc.31.d: "The Ministry of Socialist Enlightenment is ready to organize a world futurist exhibition in Ukraine. The venue was chosen as Kharkiv, a rapidly developing city whose inhabitants would be happy to welcome foreign delegations."

Foreign filmmakers are being invited to Ukraine, and French film critic and theorist Leon Mussinac has already expressed his consent. Particular importance is given to cultural films - popular science films for education and upbringing, production films.\n\nIn addition, there are plans to increase the number of cinemas so that Ukrainian people can watch Ukrainian films in Ukrainian, in many cases absolutely free of charge.

ukrsoc.46.t: "KB 'Komsomol' Tractors"
ukrsoc.46.d: "The Constructing Bureau 'Komsomol' has presented the new designs of tractors for our peasants. As a part of state-funded mechanization of agriculture, new tractors will be issued to the peasants in several stages, achieving full mechanization of agricultural industry in a few years."
ukrsoc.46.a: "Our great achievement!"

ukrsoc.47.t: "A Record Harvest!"
ukrsoc.47.d: "Thanks to the efforts of our party and the wise leadership of the government and Prime Minister Ritchicki, this year the peasants harvested a record harvest! This is a great achievement for our breadbasket!"
ukrsoc.47.a: "Achievement of Socialism!"

ukrsoc.48.t: "Feeder of the World"
ukrsoc.48.d: "Our efforts were not in vain, and now we can proudly say that we feed the whole world with our bread! However, with such a great achievement comes a great responsibility. Now we can actually control the price of grain, and other countries will have to accept it. The right thing to do would of course be to lower the price of grain for the neediest and poorest countries. By increasing the price of grain for all, we will substantially improve the standard of living of our citizens, sending this money to social needs. At the same time, we can lower the price of grain so that there are as few needy people in the world as possible."
ukrsoc.48.a: "Raise grain prices"
ukrsoc.48.b: "Lower grain prices"
ukrsoc.48.c: "Special price for the third world countries"

ukrsoc.49.t: "Triumph of 'Chervonyi Prapor'"
ukrsoc.49.d: "Today the Central Committee of the Party officially issued a ban on nongovernmental newspapers. According to a summary in the main revolutionary newspaper Chervonyi Prapor, other newspapers express the interests of the petty bourgeoisie and outright enemies of the revolutionary achievements of Richytskyi’s party. "
ukrsoc.49.a: "Only governmental press is allowed!"

### ukrsoc.50-100 reserved for Kyiv Conference ###
ukrsoc.50.t: "Third Internationale & Colonial Problem"
ukrsoc.50.d: "\"The Third International, created by the forces of the syndicalist revolution in Europe, seemed to be the beginning of the World Revolution. A revolution that would free the whole world from the oppression of Imperialism and Colonialism, but what do we see? We see that the governments of socialist Europe are not ready to give an answer to the question of what the world will be like after the liberation of the colonies of world capitalism. The workers and peasants, the dehkans, the poorest people of Africa, Asia and America are in bondage, and the Third International does not give us an answer to the question of what its program on this subject will be. The hypocritical liars in Paris, London, and even Moscow say nothing about small peoples, about colonialism, about the liberation of the proletariat in the whole world, not only in Europe and North America. While the nations dream of freedom, the French government dreams of Alsace, and the socialist parties of Russia dream of restoring the empire. Our party is ready to lead the international struggle, for the liberation of the oppressed of the world. We do not divide territories, we believe that under communism every nation is worthy to remember its history and defend its culture against any globalist superculture. Down with Imperialism! Long live the free world!\""
ukrsoc.50.a: "Internationale provides no solution..."

ukrsoc.51.t: "Organisation of the Kyiv Conference"
ukrsoc.51.d: "In view of the Third Internationale’s inability to solve the colonial question and to present an effective solution to the problem, we must take it upon ourselves to organize a conference of all the powers defending or defending themselves against colonial oppression and sharing our anti-imperialist values."
ukrsoc.51.a: "Send out the invitations"

ukrsoc.52.t: "Invitation to the Kyiv Conference"
ukrsoc.52.d: "The Socialist Government of Ukraine organizes a world conference in Kyiv on international cooperation of anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist powers. We have received an official invitation from the Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs"
ukrsoc.52.a: "We will attend"
ukrsoc.52.b: "What a stupid idea!"

ukrsoc.53.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Delegation Arrives"
ukrsoc.53.d: "The [FROM.GetName] has accepted our invitation to the Conference and their delegation has already arrived to Kyiv."
ukrsoc.53.a: "Splendid!"

ukrsoc.54.t: "Start the Conference"
ukrsoc.54.d: "With the majority of delegations arrived and gathered in Kyiv, it is high time we start our Conference. There are a lot of question to be discussed."
ukrsoc.54.a: "Most important matters should be discussed"

ukrsoc.55.t: "The Left Front Meeting"
ukrsoc.55.d: "Before the start of the main Conference, the leftist countries have gathered to discuss additional issues against colonialism. Richytskyi is willing to support the leftist more, at a cost of influencing the nations under his own vision of Communist thought. The main issue is providing extra help for the proletarians and peasants of the socialist countries, the issue to be decided on now."
ukrsoc.55.a: "So what’s on the list?"

ukrsoc.56.t: "$ukrsoc.55.t$"
ukrsoc.56.d: "Before the start of the main conference, the socialist countries have gathered together as the [FROM.GetLeader] wants to provide extra help for those who fight for peasants and workers. The main issue is if we need extra help from Ukraine or not."
ukrsoc.56.a: "We need extra help!"
ukrsoc.56.b: "We are doing alright!"

ukrsoc.57.t: "[FROM.GetName] Asks for Extra Aid"
ukrsoc.57.d: "When it is time for the [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation to speak, they asked for extra help for their struggle against imperialism."
ukrsoc.57.a: "Provide extra help!"

ukrsoc.58.t: "Economic Cooperation"
ukrsoc.58.d: "The first question to be discussed at the conference is the issue of the economic cooperation. Since the economic development of the countries of Asia, Africa and America is low, thanks to the Imperialist policies, it is important to install economic cooperation on the basis of mutual interest and respect for sovereignity. The member states are supposed to do collective actions to stabilise international prices and demand for resources."
ukrsoc.58.a: "Voting will soon begin..."

ukrsoc.59.t: "Cultural & Research Cooperation"
ukrsoc.59.d: "The development of the cultural cooperation is one of the most powerful measures to increase mutual understanding between our countries. Asia and Africa are the cradles of great religions and civilizations that have enriched other cultures and civilizations in the process of their own enrichment. Consequently, the cultures of Asia and Africa are based on spiritual and common foundations.\n\nMoreover, a research society should be founded in order to share technological advances in our countries."

ukrsoc.60.t: "Human Rights and Self-Determination"
ukrsoc.60.d: "1. The Kyiv Conference declares its full support for the basic principles of human rights. The conference declares its full support for the principle of self-determination of peoples and nations. \n2. The Kyiv Conference condemns the policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination, which are the basis of governmental attitudes and human relations in large parts of Africa and in other parts of the world. Such conduct is not only a gross violation of human rights, but also a denial of the basic values of civilization and human dignity. The Conference expresses its fervent sympathy and support for the courageous stand taken by the victims of racial discrimination; expresses its admiration for those who support their cause; reaffirms the determination of the peoples of Asia, Africa and America to destroy all traces of racism that may still be present in their own countries; and undertakes to use all its moral influence to guard against the danger of falling into the same evil in their struggle to eradicate racism."

ukrsoc.61.t: "Problems of the Dependent Peoples"
ukrsoc.61.d: "1. The Kyiv Conference discussed the problems of dependent peoples, colonialism, and the evils of subjecting peoples to foreign domination and exploitation. The conference agreed: (a) to declare that colonialism in all its manifestations constitutes an evil which must be speedily suppressed; (b) to affirm that the subjection of peoples to foreign subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental human rights and an obstacle to the promotion of international peace and cooperation; (c) to support the cause of freedom and independence of all such peoples; (1) to call upon the countries concerned to grant freedom and independence to such peoples.\n2. In view of the unsettled situation in North Africa and the persistent denial of the right of the peoples of North Africa to self-determination, the Kyiv Conference expresses its support for the rights of the peoples of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to self-determination and independence, and calls upon the French Government to achieve without delay a peaceful settlement of the matter."

ukrsoc.62.t: "Kyiv Conference Demands"
ukrsoc.62.d: "We have received a note of protest from the countries, that gathered at the Kyiv Conference about our 'exploitation of the dependent peoples in North Africa'. They have demanded that we should immediately give them independence and withdraw from their rightful lands."
ukrsoc.62.a: "What nonsense"

ukrsoc.63.t: "Declaration on the Promotion\nof Universal Peace & Cooperation"
ukrsoc.63.d: "Free from mistrust and fear and imbued with trust and goodwill toward one another, countries should tolerate and live in peace with one another as good neighbors and develop friendly cooperation on the basis of the following principles: \n1. Respect for fundamental human rights. \n2. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries. \n3. Recognition of the equality of all races and the equality of all nations, large and small. \n4. Refraining from intervention and interference in the internal affairs of another country. \n5. Respect for the right of each country to defend itself individually or collectively. \n6. (А). Refraining from using collective defense agreements for the private benefit of any of the great powers. (В). The abstention of any country from exerting pressure on other countries. \n7. Refraining from acts or threats of aggression or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any country. \n8. Settlement of all international disputes by peaceful means-such as negotiation, conciliation\n9. Promotion of mutual interests and cooperation. \n10. Respect for justice and international obligations. "

ukrsoc.101.t: "Discrediting Shakhrai Campaign"
ukrsoc.101.d: "Due to the ban on factionalism in the party, one of the Ukapist leaders, Vasyl Shakhrai, soon fell under a campaign of discredit. He was accused of revisionism, imperialism, and collaboration with the opposition parties of the Socialist Revolutionaries and the Social Democrats. In addition, he was also attributed ties with Shumskyi. Shakhrai is no longer mentioned in the press, and his merits are greatly diminished. Moreover, he ceased to be published in Chervonyi Prapor, the main newspaper of the UKP."
ukrsoc.101.a: "Can’t believe he was once our leader!"

ukrsoc.102.t: "The King of Futuroprairies"
ukrsoc.102.d: "Extremely popular among Ukrainians, the futurists challenge all Russian-speaking futurists who imagine themselves as judges and leaders.\n\nIn their vital escapade, Shkurupyi and Semenko wittily appropriated motifs from popular adventure novels (Mein Ried, Fenimore Cooper, Gustave Emar), threatening to scalp the capital’s \"literary generals\" of futurism - thus trying on themselves the role of Ukrainian Indians who rebelled against Russian authorities. It should be noted that on the cover and title page of his first poetry collection "Psychetozy: Vitryna tretia" (Kyiv, 1922) the 19-year-old author attested himself: THE KING OF FUTUROPRAIRIES GEO SHKURUPYI."
ukrsoc.102.a: " Ukraine’s young talents are our pride."

ukrsoc.103.t: "Coalition With UPSR"
ukrsoc.103.d: "The UPSR leadership reacted quite optimistically to the invitation to join the coalition. In addition to being the largest party in the country and having enormous support among the peasantry, their inclusion in the government would also accelerate the land reform planned under the SR’s program of land socialization.\n\nShakhrai warmly welcomed the UPSR delegates to today’s meeting in the government and said that the key to the friendship of the socialist parties is the success of the future of the Ukrainian peasantry and proletariat."
ukrsoc.103.a: "The Left Coalition Forms!"

ukrsoc.104.t: "The Second Largest Party"
ukrsoc.104.d: "Despite our majority, the Borotbyst Party, led by Oleksandr Shumskyi, is still the second largest party in the country after the UPSR. Shumskyi is an extremely outstanding revolutionary and will be ready to lead the crowd. By demonstratively boycotting the All-Ukrainian Congress, we have lost many voices of the Ukrainian people who are ready to take up arms for the triumph of the Borotbysts. \n\nHowever, the Ukapists and the Borotbysts have much in common, and Shumskyi would obviously benefit from becoming our ally. In this connection, Shakhrai addressed an official letter to Shumskyi and an invitation to take the position of minister without portfolio. In addition, we invited the borotbyst to join the left-wing coalition of socialist parties. This offer is very advantageous for Shumskyi, who can join our socialist cabinet painlessly and peacefully."
ukrsoc.104.a: "Let us await for his answer..."

ukrsoc.105.t: "Shumskyi Joins the Coalition"
ukrsoc.105.d: "Today, after the government meeting, Shakhrai returned to his office, where Minister of Agriculture and one of the leaders of the Ukapists, Antin Drahomyretskyi, was waiting for him.\nShumskyi and his representatives, who had jouned a coalition with the Ukapists during the session, were present at the government session for the first time. \n\nShakhrai and Drahomyretskyi discussed some pressing issues and prepared a plan for land reform - in fact, repeating Lenin’s decree on land, that is - the SRs’ Socialization of Land, but later there was a talk of the Borotbysts’ participation in the work of the government.\nDrahomyretskyi only took off his glasses, looked at the prime minister and said:"
ukrsoc.105.a: "\"In my opinion it was obvious that he would agree.\""

ukrsoc.106.t: "The 'Molot' Newspaper"
ukrsoc.106.d: "Today the first issue of the new government newspaper, the \"Hammer\" or the \"Molot\", came out. In fact, the paper is all propaganda for the Ukapists and their achievements and promises. In addition, the paper also contains criticism of other Reds, mainly of the Borotbysts and the national-traitors of the \"Ukrainian\" Bolsheviks who are abroad.\n\nAlthough people are generally happy with the paper, there are those who have begun to criticize Shakhrai for being authoritarian and propagandizing his ideas. On the other hand, this is not a crime, is it?"
ukrsoc.106.a: "The new mouthpiece of communism!"

ukrsoc.107.t: "Shift in Mass Perceptions"
ukrsoc.107.d: "With the entry of the Borotbysts into the coalition and their regular criticism in the 'Molot', the masses began to drift away from Shumskyi’s influence. Recently, in the local Radas, more and more former Borotbyst supporters openly referred to themselves as Ukapists. It is quite expected that the Ukapists will have a clear majority in the next local council elections. \n\nIt is unknown how Shumskyi himself will react to this, but the main thing is that the masses are coming over to our side, strengthening our united socialist front and bringing Ukraine closer to communism."
ukrsoc.107.a: "Towards victory!"

ukrsoc.108.t: "Decree On Land"
ukrsoc.108.d: "Today, after months and even years of waiting, Ukrainian peasants are free masters of their land. Thanks to a government decree on the socialization of landed estates and their transfer to local land councils, there will be no more inequality in Ukraine. \n\nPeasants! Chase away the capitalists, landlords, bourgeoisie, and foreign gentry. From now on, you will dispose of your land yourselves"
ukrsoc.108.a: "Final liberation of peasants!"

ukrsoc.109.t: "Ukrainian Marxist Congress"
ukrsoc.109.d: "The members of the UKP and the USDRP gave the green light for the Marxist Congress. Today, in Kyiv there will be the first congress of Ukrainian marxists. Nothing will be decided on this event, it has only advisory role, but this kind of cooperation is still highly symbolic. Main invitations were sent to the prominent members of UKP and USDRP, as well as their youth wings. Members of other coalition parties were invited too — but not in that scale. It was a marxist event, and a really important one. With speeches, discussions, ecen fights, the people grew united. The left of the UKP and the Right of USDRP cannot stand each other and either tried to ignore, or, opposite, engage in all the discussions. \n\nAfter all, the congress mood was decided by the youth wings, who pushed a statement, noncommital one, but still powerful, which proclaimed: «The worker’s parties of the UKP and USDRP are looking forward to closest cooperation of all socialist forces against reaction, capitalism and all forms of imperialism brickering. In this regard, such conferences should continue, widening its base to other socialist parties, striving for uniting a revolutionary democracy in one struggle — a class struggle against the rulling classes and for the victory of world revolution». While for the Right wing presented such speech was wishful thinking, and for the left — a compromise with petit-bourgoise, but for the most people it was a start."
ukrsoc.109.a: "Interesting"

ukrsoc.110.t: "Advisory Center of Revolutionary Democracy"
ukrsoc.110.d: "The complete unification of revolutionary parties appeared to be a mere idealistic thought than a reality. Such unification threatened a split — and even in the form of UKP-USDRP unification, serious obstacles appeared, mostly from the right and the left of the parties, which practically sabotaged such process. But it wasnt useless nonetheless. A proposal seems to passed through the coalition’s parties — creation of the so-called «advisory center of revolutionary democracy» — an elected group of representatives of all the coalition parties, practically powerless and only formal, but at the same time being a collective organ beyond all the individual parties — as a show of commitment to the coalition. Such center could be looked at as some, very vague form of confederative party unification and used for coordination of revolutionary actions. If created, it could be the first step for the one and only Ukrainian Socialist Party."
ukrsoc.110.a: "Approve the formation of such center"
ukrsoc.110.b: "Block it. UKP should not be united with petty-bourgouise philisters!"

ukrsoc.111.t: "Close Ties With Bolsheviks"
ukrsoc.111.d.nsp: "Even though the government in power in Russia is trying to distance itself from the fact that they are Bolsheviks, it does not change that fact. Nikolai Bukharin, in many ways the more democratic proponent of socialism and propagandist of his model of market socialism, is in fact the very real Bolshevik and a longtime acquaintance of Skrypnyk.\n\nIn this connection, the government today sent a delegation to Soviet Russia with the hope of concluding a friendly alliance on independent terms. "
ukrsoc.111.d: "The Socialist Revolution has triumphed in Russia and the Bolsheviks, led by [RUS.GetLeader], are once again in the forefront of Soviet Russian politics. As longtime acquaintances of the Russian leader, Skrypnyk would be happy to strike a lucrative deal.\n\nIn this connection, the government today sent a delegation to Soviet Russia with the hope of concluding a friendly alliance on independent terms.

ukrsoc.115.t: "Russia Refused!"
ukrsoc.115.d: "Despite close relations between our leaders, it seems that Russia follows a bit different policy, if talking about Ukrainian independence. With stupid accusation of nationalism, the Russian government has refused any cooperation."

ukrsoc.124.t: "The Land Issue"
ukrsoc.124.d: "The issue of land reform is one of the hottest topics of discussion at the Party Congress. Moreover, the options for resolving this problem are plentiful, but delegates have not yet been able to agree.\n\nThe Centrists’ plan is the municipalization of land, which implies the transfer of land into the hands of local councils, which will then distribute it among the peasants. \n\nThere is also a proposal to divide the land according to 'who can cultivate how much' and the same division, but with a declared minimum of 50 hectares. Smaller lands would have to be divided among the peasants.\n\nThe left faction advocated a Narodnik land reform - that is, its socialization, transferring it into the hands of all the Ukrainian peasants. Large farms are to be preserved and production cooperatives to be created on their basis.\n\nSo far, the final choice has not been made, but by the end of the week the Central Committee of the USDRP intends to make a final decision..."

ukrsoc.125.d: "The Otaman of the Army, Symon Petliura, member of the Dyrektoria and one of the key figures in the USDRP is now seen by the government as a threat to the People’s Democracy in Ukraine.\n\nFaction of his supporters also grows in number, making his voice significant. This situation is not preferable for the majority of the USDRP Central Committee, who see Petliura as a warmonger and a careerist. Dissatisfaction with Petliura has already reached such a stage that the Central Committee is ready to vote to expel him from the party, but some have spoken out against such a decision and suggest that he simply be relegated to a second echelon of politics by removing him from office. With a slight majority, the Central Committee votes for..."

ukrsoc.1250.t: "140 Attempts"
ukrsoc.1250.d: "Some people have reported to other certain people that more than 140 attempts have been made on General Petliura's life and health in the last few months, but none of them have been successful. Each time, almost miraculously, the general was completely unharmed and unscathed. \n\nAlthough we might suspect some people of unprofessionalism, we can be certain that they are experts in their field. In turn, some people have applied for additional funding for their highly secretive activities, but we have the final word."
ukrsoc.1250.a: "Increase funding!"
ukrsoc.1250.b: "They should just try better!"

ukrsoc.1251.t: "Planning the Accident"
ukrsoc.1251.d: "In a fairly ordinary apartment not far from the center of Kyiv, some citizens were sitting around and were clearly up to something. If the neighbor had been nosy enough, he probably, with the proper dexterity, could have overheard the conversation. And some people were talking about the following: how to kill General Petliura. To kill him so that he would not die. More precisely, how to plan the accident in such a way that the general would stay alive? Creating an appearance of work and deep conversation, for several days and nights some people had been planning how to commit murder without committing murder so that they would not be suspected of it. On the table a fair amount of Hryvnias were lying, received from important people, noticeably smaller than it had been in that very briefcase at the Ministry...\n\nThe answer was still not forthcoming, but surely it had already matured in the mind of one of the 'some men' and would soon be announced..."
ukrsoc.1251.a: "Hopefully they will find the answer eventually"

ukrsoc.126.t: "Subordinating the Army"
ukrsoc.126.d: "Even after the previous decision, Petliura stays as the Otaman of the Army, and so the dissatisfaction with our government in the UNR Army and among the General Staff increased greatly.\n\nSome of the USDRP members suggest that Petliura should retire from Army - the decision, which is supported by the majority of the Central Committee. However, the leftists see the whole Petliurivtsi faction as dangerous for democracy and suggest to dismiss them all.\n\nThe Central Committee should make its decision till the end of the day."

However, different factions had a different approach to this.\n\nThus, the leftists propose to nationalize everything in general - the abolition of private property, especially the alienation from the landlords and the bourgeoisie of the sources of their capital is seen as obligatory and immutable. However, this would cause great unrest in the Western powers, especially in Germany and Austria.\n\nThe centrists have taken a more moderate position, proposing that all enterprises and productions owned by Ukrainians should be left in private hands, including the medium-sized industry, and that foreign companies should be nationalized in exchange for concessions. \n\nThe rightists, on the other hand, are ready to compromise and leave some areas in private hands, especially where state control may be ineffective, such as small businesses, which are supposed to be taxed."

ukrsoc.128.t: "The Question of Concessions"
ukrsoc.128.d: "With the nationalization of the foreign assets, the question of their concessions is now very important. On the one hand, the nationalization requires some compensation from us, or else the foreign powers will consider it as requisition. On the other hand, in return for their investments, the foreign capitalists will receive superprofits due to the mostly fixed prices."

However, they are now asking for concessions - so that we can invest in our former industries and get profit. However, some conservative members in our government are strongly opposed to doing so and require us to boycott the socialist Ukraine’s offer and demand compensation!"

With the coming to power of the Dyrektoria, the new government was faced with challenges that the old program could not solve. Moreover, the new program was to have not only tactical steps to eliminate the hetman’s precepts, but also strategic ones - the development of Ukrainian democracy for decades to come.\n\nAs a result of the Congress of the Central Committee and the first decrees adopted, for many it became obvious that the new program outweighed the \"Leftist\" ideas and tactics. In this connection, some ministers have already announced their resignation. In the meantime, the USDRP was consolidating and preparing to carry out the next serious reforms."

ukrsoc.137.d: "With the left-wing of USDRP dominant and party program adopting thesises of democratic dictatorship of proletariat and a transition of power to soviets, a series of resignation happened, severely weakening the party and its image.\n\nIn this chaos, Panas Fedenko and Isaac Masepa left the office in protest, saying that «we cannot give revolutionary democracy only limited extend — to the Soviets». With them gone, party balance crumbles and important positions in the government and in party are now missing.\n\nIn this demarché, Fedenko and Masepa openned newspaper «Novyi Chas» — as a clear reference to «Neue Zeit» of Karl Kautsky, having the ambition to give platform for the center and right, and even anti-soviet left of the party to speak from «social-democratic opposition» against communist tendencies of USDRP.\n\nWith the opposition strengthening and actions taken, the government grabs their chance to use this chaos to their advantage — bringing new candidacies and preparing reforms — achieving popular support and truly, the mandate of the people, trying to knock the ground out from under opposition’s feet"
ukrsoc.137.a: "Consolidate the government, we cannot split the party for a second time!"

ukrsoc.138.t: "Cultural-Personal National Autonomy"
ukrsoc.138.d: "The Ukrainian Social Democratic Party professes the ideal of national cultural-personal autonomy. First formulated by Otto Bauer in 1907, it remains the prevailing ethnic policy of the Austro-Marxist movement, from which the USDRP borrows most of its ideas - it seeks to turn the nation not into a territorial and ethnic entity, but into a simple association of people, separating the state from its territory. After all, what does it say about being Ukrainian that you have to live in this particular section of Europe and follow a certain set of traditions? If you consider yourself Ukrainian, have Ukrainian citizenship, and contribute to the country - through taxes or other means - what prevents you from being considered Ukrainian?\n\nMany Jewish Bundist ideologues held a similar view, which turned the Social Democrats and the Bundists into natural allies. During its term, the Social Democrat government would seek significant reforms to achieve its ideal of National Cultural and Personal Autonomy. Every ethnic group in Ukraine would have their own universal cultural assemblies, able to levy their own taxes and autonomously decide matters concerning their members. Every citizen of Ukraine would belong to one of these cultural assemblies, but the question of which national movement to join would be a matter of personal choice, and no government would control the decision."

ukrsoc.139.t: "Jewish Cultural Autonomy Elections"
ukrsoc.139.d: "The idea of national personal autonomy suggests that the state should interfere in cultural and ethnic affairs as little as possible, and instead transfer power in these areas to autonomous communities that have no territory but are a community or syndicate of people who associate themselves with a given ethnic group by choice. These autonomous ethnic communities could levy their own taxes, create their own educational programs, and, of course, elect their own leadership.\n\nToday, the cultural autonomy of Ukrainian Jews holds elections. Although outwardly dominated by the Jewish Workers’ Bund (in alliance with the USDRP) and its electoral lists, the Jewish community of Ukraine is very ideologically diverse, and although socialism is prominent among them, the Achdus religious party has suddenly gained an advantage in a number of polls. The election results will undoubtedly define Jewish cultural autonomy for years to come, and..."

These autonomous ethnic communities could levy their own taxes, create their own educational programs, and, of course, elect their own leadership.\n\nToday, the cultural autonomy of Crimean Tatars holds elections. With Crimean separatism still quite active, the Qırımtatarlar Beysezlege Echen Partiya (Party for Crimean Tatar Independence), a radical nationalist organisation, mostly consisted of young Crimean Tatars struggles to win against Milliy Fırqa (National Party). However, they still have a chance due to the split in the main Crimean Tatar party: two candidates are struggling for victory. The first is Seidamet Jafer, an ideologue and one of the leaders of the Crimean Tatar people in the initial period of the Civil War, Minister of War and Minister of Foreign Affairs in the first government of the national hero of Crimea N. Celebijikhan and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Crimean Regional Government of Sulkevich, until the resignation of the latter.\nThe second is Amet Ozenbashly, a candidate with a socialist bias in his views. He participated in the negotiations between the government of Sulkevich and the Hetman in 1918, and then did not emigrate and in 1920 became one of the founders of the agricultural organization "Shirket", which had branches in all regions of the Crimea. In addition, he became a member of the organization "Koch Yardim" ("Assistance to migrants"), which aimed to create favorable conditions for the return of Crimean Tatars from Turkey and the Bulgarian Tsardom."

ukrsoc.1400.d: "With the cultural-personal national autonomies act passed, a lot of various social-democratic organisation and parties of local peoples have been founded in Ukraine. Some of the most popular and widespread ones are the \"Social-Democratic Labour Party of the Crimean Tatars\" and \"Party of Ukrainian Romy\". While some deputies of the Rada claim that the local representation in the government and parliament is not enough, this is not the main case of the national-personal autonomies.\n\nHowever, the government is now faced with several decisions to make: either establish a 'Confederation' of Social-Democratic parties in Ukraine, which will likely include the Jewish Bund, invite Roma and Crimean Tatar social-democrats in the ruling coalition, or just simply leave everything as it is for the sake of socialist democracy."

ukrsoc.141.d: "For the better part of modern history, Ukraine has been under the thumb of a foreign power. Be it the Russians, Poles, or Germans, we have had little to no chance for our culture to thrive. This has not been helped by period of Russification and other such attempts to strip our nation of it’s uniqueness. This shall stand no longer! Under the people’s government, our culture will thrive. Be it promotion of events featuring famous works of art, state sponsored food expos, or funding the arts in general, we shall not rest until Ukraine’s culture is revived! While this may draw the ire of Russiphiles in the East and the Poles in the west, we know our cause is just. Ukraine shall be a phoenix from the ashes, rising to meet the culture challenges of the modern day."
ukrsoc.141.a: "One step closer towards our goal."

ukrsoc.142.t: "Jewish Labour Bund"
ukrsoc.142.d: "The Jewish Labour Bund has a long story of cooperation with Ukrainian Social Democracy. Although on some issues the opinions of the Bund were different from the Ukrainian ones, since the Hetmanist government banned and prevented any Bundas activities, Dyrektoria became a natural ally of socialist Jewish organisation.\n\nWith the establishement of the People’s Republic, the Bund has returned to Ukraine and took part in organising the Bundas - Jewish trade unions. Although the Bundas are trade unions, they are being organised by Jews, and for Jews alone. While the left generally approve of the Bundas autonomy, the rightists believe that a central trade union under joint USDRP-Bund authority should be created. This will help us to get our parties closer to each other and prevent any misunderstandings with the local Bundas."
ukrsoc.142.a: "Leave the Bundas alone."
ukrsoc.142.b: "A united USDRP-Bund organisation of trade unions."

ukrsoc.143.t: "Derzhavnyi Bank & Cooperation"
ukrsoc.143.d: "The Ukrainian Central Rada established the Derzhavnyi Bank back in 1917, but Hetman had to create the Ukrainian Derzhavnyi Bank, in fact, anew. It was Hetman’s Minister of Finance Rzhepetskyi who was one of the \"architects\" of the Derzhavnyi Bank in its present form.\n\nWith the coming of the Dyrektoria to power, the Derzhavnyi Bank proved to be a strong body, which could control private banks and cooperation, and in fact attach them to itself at the expense of lending activities.\n\nNow many banks are still private and in the hands of capitalists, especially the cooperative banks, which are engaged in credit activities for farmers and peasants. Nevertheless, we can use the Derzhavnyi Bank to increase control over private banks. In fact, the government proposes to nationalize the banks - but to give them directly to the Derzhavnyi Bank."
ukrsoc.143.a: "We should control the money flow in the country."

ukrsoc.144.t: "Bankruptcy of Poltava Silskoop Bank"
ukrsoc.144.d: "Due to the recent nationalization of Banks, the Poltava Village Cooperative Bank claimed its bankruptcy, leaving about a thousand depositors without their money. Spontaneous protests by deceived depositors emerged, who blamed the repressive impact of the Derzhavnyi Bank, which set a high interest rate for credit loans. Local Poltava councils have already stated the need to support depositors, and have asked the government directly to address the situation and subsidize farms and khutors in Poltavshchyna.\n\nThe government’s response has not yet been received, but it is clear to many that the Derzhavnyi Bank needs to be restricted, and probably set a maximum interest rate."
ukrsoc.144.a: "The issue of depositors will be resolved."

ukrsoc.145.t: "Fight For Kherson"
ukrsoc.145.d: "After strengthening the power of municipal councils, it was decided to hold new elections in Kherson. The rural region faced an almost deadlocked situation for the first time: the traditional majority of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the relatively recent coalition of the USDRP-leftists and Ukapists were fighting head-to-head for the Kherson Local Rada. \n\nDespite the great support for the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Kherson has recently begun to develop actively, and industrialization has begun in the city, which has caused a sharp influx of the working population.\n\nAccording to pre-election polls, the coalition of the UKP and the leftists of the USDRP has caught up with the SRs in less than 2 months and now they are keeping up. The results of these elections will probably change not only Kherson, but the entire surrounding region."
ukrsoc.145.a: "UPSR retains its majority."
ukrsoc.145.b: "UKP-USDRP coalition eventually wins."

ukrsoc.146.t: "Rumors of a Coalition With the Ukapists" 
ukrsoc.146.d: "Yesterday many Ukrainian newspapers carried an interesting news item with a headline about possible negotiations between the ruling Social Democrats and the Ukapists. The new course adopted by the USDRP brought them closer to former co-partisans who had left the party as a result of a split 20 years earlier. \n\nWhile many were wondering whether the rumors were the real facts or another conjecture of imaginative journalists, the Rada of People’s Ministers announced the appointment of Ukapist ministers to a number of posts."
ukrsoc.146.a: "Interesting"

ukrsoc.147.t: "USDRP-UKP Coalition Announced!"
ukrsoc.147.d: "The USDRP and the UKP have worked together a great deal recently, despite the absence of an official coalition. In some local council elections, the Ukapists preferred to unite with the leftist USDRP in a single electoral bloc and successfully won seats in this way. \n\nToday, during a speech in parliament, the leader of the Ukapists, Vasyl Shakhrai, announced that a coalition government would be formed and that his party would enter parliament on an official basis. Thus, one of the prominent UKP members, Mykhailo Tkachenko, was appointed as the new Minister of Internal Affairs. \n\nThe changes in the government caused a mixed reaction among some members of the USDRP, especially right-wing members, who condemned the decision of the Central Committee and the government. There were even claims that the USDRP had finally descended into Bolshevism."
ukrsoc.147.a: "Ukrainian Social-Democrats unite once again."

ukrsoc.148.t: "A Single Party?"
ukrsoc.148.d: "After the announcement of the official coalition between the Social Democrats and the Ukapists, the parties became even closer to each other. Their fundamental differences that had led to the splits were now less significant, and so there was talk among high-ranking officials of uniting the two parties - or rather, of reuniting them.\n\nDespite the fact that unification would in no way change the current state of affairs, the USDRP should expect a split from the other side - from the right-wing Social Democrats, who are very negative about the prospect of becoming a single party with the former 'Nezalezhniki'.\n\nThe fundamental question now is the name of the future party. On the one hand, the Social Democrats insist on retaining the current name with the prefix 'united' - to show the essence of the new party. On the other hand, the Ukapists insist that the new party be called the UKP, in honor of our intentions and ultimate goal."
ukrsoc.148.a: "USDRP(o) - don’t forget who we are."
ukrsoc.148.b: "UKP - towards our future."

ukrsoc.149.t: "Another Split?"
ukrsoc.149.d: "The unification of the USDRP with the Ukapists caused a number of problems within the new party. Politicians from among the \"right-wing\" Social-Democrats reacted negatively not only to the merger but also to the new name of the party. At first this fundamental contradiction was suppressed by speeches and convictions about party unity, but toward the end the influence of the Left became too strong. \n\nConsequently, a number of politicians announced their withdrawal from the party and announced an opposition coalition to the new government. Their main partner in this endeavor was the ULD(S-F). The opposition stated that the new course of Ukraine would lead the country to ruin and called on the other parties to join them and change the government democratically."
ukrsoc.149.a: "Unity is what Ukraine needs, not schism!"

ukrsoc.150.t: "Great Constuctions..."
ukrsoc.150.d: "The idea of a Red Kyiv swept the minds of socialist intellectuals throughout Ukraine, and a new project was proposed - supporters began calling it "The Great Buildings of Kyiv" - a project of major redevelopment of Kyiv, including monumental architecture, skyscrapers and cultural squares that would be filled with public space with unique designs by the best architects and artists throughout Ukraine.\n\nThe new project looks set to double the size of Kyiv, creating a massive increase in new jobs and living standards in the city. It also involves the use of modern and even experimental technologies.\n\nThe city’s new plans radically increase spending on cultural spaces, architecture, public transportation, and parks, but everything comes at a price. This massive budgetary pressure will not go unnoticed - it requires tax increases for peasants and budget cuts for other regions, which is sure to anger many."

ukrsoc.151.d: "The vision between Red Kyiv is a modern and radical one of the misto-sad, a city which mends the schism between citizens and nature and to this, Kyiv aspires to be the new city never seen before. Financing green projects became an important part of the Red Kyiv project — with even Vynnychenko lobbying for “naturalization” of the city to realize his concordist vision — of people harmonized with nature. New parks. lakes, green roofs, vineyards hanging on the streets, Kyiv ressembles a city of futurism.\n\nMunicipality of the city put in a lot of work to make this vision a reality, but such projects appeared to be too ambitious for the city to hold in normal conditions. In serious discussion, the city council decided to announce a referendum about labour mobilizations — as it is the only way for the plan to be done without overextending the budget. While the population seems rather optimistic and is ready to work harder than ever before, such an approach sparks a lot of controversies in the city council..."

Such regional exceptionality moved the peasants in the opposition and forced UPSR to adopt harsher stances to our government.

The most active election campaign was inextricably linked with the capital of our republic - the city of Kyiv. In the first years of the UNR, the head of the city was lawyer Riabtsov Yevhen from the Socialist Revolutionary Party, until he was removed from his post by the Hetman government, which put Karl Marshalk, in his place.\n\nWhen the Dyrektoria came to power, the Kyiv Rada was dissolved until the All-Ukrainian Congress was convened. Now the right to govern the city is being fought over again - and this time, the contender for the position of Kyiv mayor is Volodymyr Chekhivskyi, a native of Kyiv Governorate, and together with his team of SDs is ready to radically transform the city, making it the proletarian capital of Europe. \n\nThe capital was greeted with a resounding victory for the Social Democrats - with an almost 40-percent margin, Chekhivskyi’s bloc came out on top, taking an honorable majority in the local council. Now the city was under the rule of the USDRP, and modernization, greening, and other ambitious projects awaited it."

As Vynnychenko said once: “If Freud knew about Concordism, he should have immediately become a member of social-democratic party”. To be at the helm of marxist, socialist and psychoanalytical discussions, first “Freudo-marxist studies” were established. However, not limited to Freud and Marx, they gave a new framework for combining social liberation with psychological and individual one.\n\nNew studies gathered psychoanalytics and theoretics around the world, and all the people around the world, especially from Third Internationale countries visiting the city to listen to such people as Otto Fenichel, Wilhelm Reich and Erich Fromm to give birth of what would be called as “Kyiv school of psychoanalysis”"

ukrsoc.161.t: "Hrushevskyi's Long-Awaited Speech"
ukrsoc.161.d: "Hrushevskyi, one of the most important persons of Ukrainian revolution in 1917 — respected among most of Ukrainians as a father figure for the whole Ukrainian movement, and hated by the nationalists for alleged mismanagement and ‘too democratic’ way of governance. Now, history gives its most passionate actor, the historian himself, a second chance. Again, as ten years before, Hrushevskyi stands among the hundreds of thousand people, waving Ukrainian and red flags...\n\nTo the people of Ukraine, a nation of free, on the land of free, revolutionary greetings! To all the brave heroes, who died fighting for freedom and liberty, we are now standing, united and free! Not tsarist chains, german bayonets or Hetman’s police broke us! Today, the republic stands firmly. With laboring peoples standing and its helm — and first, from 1917, ready to decide their destiny! From now on, Ukraine will be free from landlords, dictators and tsars — either German, Austrian or Russian, with the trust of people backing the UPSR. We are announcing the start of realization of our program, and the most important, land reform.\nLong applause and shouting were heard all over the street. Hope was reborn in the people, and for days after everyone was waiting — will the government deliver on their promises? Is Ukraine really free, is it really, a reality? Even skeptical nationalists were moved by mass support given for Hrushevskyi and UPSR and limited their criticism for a time. Now, everyone was waiting, what would happen next.
ukrsoc.161.a: "Have you heard already a brilliant speech of Hrushevskyi?"

ukrsoc.162.t: "Selianska Spilka Restored"
ukrsoc.162.d: "The spread of the idea of organizing peasant unions in the depths of the \"old\" Ukrainian lands, as well as the rise of the national movement, in particular the creation of the Ukrainska Selianska spilka (Ukrainian peasant union), contributed radically to national and class organization of Ukrainian people. On the territory of the Kyiv, Poltava and Podillia provinces, where the absolute dominance of the Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries was observed, There was an intensive process of formation of local branches of the Ukrainian Peasant Union, an alternative to the All-Russian Peasant Union.\n\nThe Peasants' Union demanded from the Ukrainian Central Council the abolition of private ownership of land and its transfer to the ownership of the people; it did not recognize the hetman's power. The 2nd All-Ukrainian Peasants' Congress convened by the Peasants' Union took place on May 21-23, 1918, secretly in the Holosiiv Forest near Kyiv;\nIt protested against German interference in Ukrainian affairs, declared its loyalty to the Ukrainian People's Republic, and called on the peasantry to fight against the Hetmanate. After the division of the UPSR (May 15, 1918), the Peasants' Union, unlike the Borotbysts, found itself aligned to the \"central current\" of the UPSR under the leadership of N. Hryhoriyev. After years of repressions by the Hetman, Spilka wasn't destroyed and was always the force to be reckoned with. Even with Hetman’s support of landowners and police raids to the gatherings of Spilka, its organizations organized illegal activities and leaders went to exile, participating in creation of Directoria — a revolutionary republican coalition.\n\nNow it's time to recreate and legalize Selianska Spilka, elect its leadership and renew its participation in governance and politics of the newly found Ukrainian People’s Republic."

ukrsoc.164.d: "In Greater Ukraine, the cooperative began its struggle for the right to function as a type of economic formation. The relatively wide branching of Ukrainian cooperation required its consolidation into cooperative unions, which were soon created. In 1913, the first Ukrainian cooperative unions were forced to liquidate and were revived only after the February Revolution of 1917.\nProduction cooperation in Ukraine did not reach its potential development until 1917 due to the lack of legal grounds. The first agricultural Artel’ not only in Ukraine, but also in the entire Russian Empire, was founded in 1894. In the early days, the number of production cooperatives grew rapidly, and by 1902 there were already more than 125 production cooperatives in Great Ukraine\nA new impetus to the development of Ukrainian cooperation was given by the Ukrainian Central Rada, which already on March 20, 1917, issued the cooperative law, which created a legal basis for the activities and congresses of domestic cooperators.\n\nImmediately after the 1st Cooperative Congress, the Ukrainian Central Cooperative Committee (UCCC) began its activities as the main temporary organization of the entire domestic national cooperation. UCCC consisted of three main departments, namely: cultural and educational, auditing and insurance. In addition, five special commissions were created within its framework: statistical, financial, legal, educational and social. \n\nThe year 1917 gave a powerful impetus to the development of all branches of cooperation in Ukraine. During this year, for example, the number of consumer associations increased to 4,873, and the center of consumer cooperation was the organization created on May 6, 1917 called \"Dniprosoiuz\", which as of January 1918 had a financial turnover of 5 million roubles. It published the semi-monthly \"Cooperative Zoria\".\n\nA financial center of Ukrainian cooperation was created with branches in all major cities of the country - the Ukrainian People's Cooperative Bank (Ukrainbank).\n\nOne of the \"Whales\" of the Ukrainian cooperative movement became the First All-Ukrainian Agricultural and Economic Cooperative Union (abbreviated as \"Central\"), which was created in January 1918. The task of \"Central\" was wide agricultural activity, as well as the unification of agricultural cooperatives into a single structure and assistance in the formation of agricultural cooperatives.\n\nUnder the Hetman power, cooperation was moderately supported, but at the same time repressed everywhere, where it gave too much power to peasants. With the restoration of the Ukrainian People’s Republic, we will make everything for the Cooperative movement to come to fruition again!"

The notoriety lingering behind the prime minister continues to generate a host of rumors and accusations, and for many, the very fact that Holubovych is once again prime minister is rather wild and inappropriate. \n\nThe fact is that it was under Holubovych's government that Skoropadskyi's armed coup took place in 1918, and it was Holubovych's government that allowed the occupation of the UNR by Austrian-German troops. The opposition to the Prime Minister demands the earliest possible consideration of this matter and the formulation of a resolution on the Party's attitude toward this incident, as well as, presumably, a vote of no confidence to the government and the Prime Minister."

The main debate is between the adoption of the Soviet platform - that is, the traditional doctrine of populism - and the adoption of a dualist platform - the recognition of both councils and parliament as important and entitled institutions.

ukrsoc.189.d: "Ukrainians killing Ukrainians — with the majority of soldiers and population really don’t understand why. Today, the newspapers reported on a small village, fully controlled by UPSR militia fighting low-scale battles against their fellow party-members from UPSR(b). The question arose: what for? Socialists, Ukrainians, even from the same party, are drawing bayonets against each other. After days of fighting, one side, we don’t know which side of the barricades, started to sing Marseillaise in Ukrainian — and the whole barricades followed, inviting each other to join them. After discussion, soldiers and peasants decided that Ukraine doesn’t deserve another bloody civil war. They created a joint Committee with officers, village heads and party leaders in the region to declare that from now on, they are done with fighting. Village will be neutral, governed by a united UPSR.\n\nSoon, the other villages and soldiers joined. Not seeing the sense and not understanding the reason for fighting, armies started to bond and take a neutral stance or completely desert. With the growing inter-ethnic violence, raids and anarchy spreading, some soldiers decided to return to their home and secure the order, while completely ignoring both mobilizations by UPR and Borotbysts."

### Borotbysts events ###

ukrsoc.190.t: "Street Shootings"
ukrsoc.190.d: "Today the residents of a small town in a seemingly prosperous region of Ukraine were greatly alarmed by the shooting that began in the center of town! Squads of the Chervona Hvardiia of the Borotbysts invaded the city limits in order to seize power in yet another settlement and overthrow the local administration, by the way, elected by the population. The local Militia officers who were in the town were taken by surprise, and as a result of this daring attack, gunfire erupted within the town limits. A reinforced group of the People's Army had already rushed to the scene, but witnesses reported dead and wounded. The anger of the inhabitants is directed not only at the rebels, but also at the government, which is unable to protect them."
ukrsoc.191.t: "Mass Expropriations!"
ukrsoc.191.d: "The announced land reform led disgruntled Borotbyst rebels to call for mass expropriations of the country's land fund. Although in recent years the number of smallholders and Khutors in Ukraine has grown, ordinary peasants have not yet forgotten the large landowners' domination and bourgeois lawlessness. Borotbysts, with their support, promote the ideas of unfair distribution that our party has promoted and demand the liquidation of kulak and farms and expropriation in favor of \"Free People's Land Use\", whatever that means. In fact, the robbed farmers are trying to go to the local courts, but without proper government attention, even legal procedures cannot protect them."
ukrsoc.192.t: "Bourgeousie Flees the Country!"
ukrsoc.192.d: "The sabotage by the Borotbysts and their henchmen among the working class and the peasantry has led to trepidation and unrest not only among ordinary townspeople and workers, but also among less pleasant individuals - the remaining bourgeoisie, usually petty, who have not yet been reached by the Red Hand of the proletariat, are fleeing the country en masse. This, of course, would be to the advantage of our government, if it were not for the capital, the large sums of money and savings they are dragging behind them. Greedy to the penny, merchants and landowners take what they can get away with, enriching neighboring countries. The Borotbysts, at the same time, rejoice, celebrating the victory of the "true people's power\"."
ukrsoc.193.t: "Railway Bombing!"
ukrsoc.193.d: "Today, residents along the Kharkiv-Yuzivka railroad woke up in the middle of the night to a loud explosion and a cloud of smoke. Apparently, the Borotbysts rebels struck quickly in the dark and just as quickly fled into the Wild Steppe. The reason for their attack is obvious: the Kharkiv-Yuzivka railway line plays a key role in supplying the People's Army with equipment, and without them our troops will have difficulty with food and ammunition. Although we will send recovery brigades to get our trains up and running more quickly, the latest attack reflects the increasingly violent nature of the insurgency. We will make sure that when we find them, they pay for their crimes."
ukrsoc.194.t: "Industry Plant Sabotage!"
ukrsoc.194.d: "This morning the residents of Odesa awoke to a terrifying sight and sound: A bomb exploded at a factory, killing several people and injuring dozens more. The bomb severely damaged the plant as well as the local infrastructure. The responsibility for the attack was claimed by none other than the Borotbysts, who claimed that the attack was aimed at businesses in Transnistria belonging to a businessman loyal to the government. Although the reaction of local firefighters and police is admirable, many locals are extremely alarmed, and some even accuse the Ukrainian government of inaction. There is even a growing murmur that the actions of the government and the Land Commission in recent days have only provoked the Borotbysts into organizing more terrorist attacks. If we want to regain the trust of our people, we must redouble our efforts to show the people that we can protect them!"
ukrsoc.195.t: "Lynching of the [GetRulingParty] Official!"
ukrsoc.195.d: "A terrifying act of terrorism took place today in a regional center that has already been covered by all the local newspapers. Today a rally of disgruntled citizens was taking place in one of the city districts, among them many workers, and of course the rally was not ignored by borotbist provocateurs, who turned it into a mass protest. A local regional deputy from the ruling party arrived at the rally to discuss pressing issues with local residents and find compromises, but the mob, enraged by the Borotbysts provocateurs, attacked the defenseless official and lynched him. About 20 people, some of whom were armed with revolvers, actually took the official hostage, then brutally beat him and handed him over to the vicious mob, which could no longer distinguish between justice and lynching. People's Army units rushed to the scene of the nightmarish incident and forcibly dispersed the protests, however, the situation takes on a distinctly chaotic character and the peaceful citizens demand that the city garrison be reinforced."
ukrsoc.196.t: "Supply Shortfall"
ukrsoc.196.d: "An important food delivery from the agrarian region to Kyiv was disrupted today, leaving stores and townspeople without fresh produce. Although the incident went virtually unnoticed by ordinary citizens, who nevertheless received the full price, it came to the attention of the government and the armed forces when it was discovered that the trucks carrying the goods had been seized by Borotbi rebels: the drivers were killed and the food was diverted to the local Red Guards, an illegal terrorist group. The disruption of food supplies has become more frequent recently, following another controversial decision of the Land Commission, which obviously contributes to the strengthening of the Borotbyst opposition."
ukrsoc.190.a: "Something must be done to stop them!"


ukrsoc.200.t: "Shumskyi Calls For All-Ukrainian Strike!"
ukrsoc.200.d: "The leader of the Borotbysts, Oleksandr Shumskyi, today in his appeal to the Ukrainian people called for an all-Ukrainian strike - in factories, railroads, etc. The URPSR(b), dissatisfied with the implementation of land reform, has been developing revolutionary sentiments and hatred of the government among our citizens, especially among peasants and workers, for quite some time. They demand an immediate solution to the land question, but have now moved on to more radical measures and are calling for a socialist revolution and what they call "liberation of the working masses from exploitation. This would not be so alarming if it were not for the actual growth of revolutionary sentiment in society. It seems that many will follow this proclamation and paralyze our economy."

ukrsoc.201.d: "Today major Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Katerynoslav, and Odesa saw major strikes by workers. Demanding fair working conditions as well as a solution to the problems of food and grain in the countryside, workers paralyzed the work of Ukraine's largest factories. Police and army forces are insufficient to contain the protests and it seems that Ukraine is sinking more and more into revolutionary chaos."

It seems that the situation in the village is finally out of the control of the central government. "

In addition, we received a number of news reports that it was in Kharkiv that the Borotbyst leadership had arrived under cover to lead the revolution. According to the latest reports, the revolutionary masses have seized the telegraph, post office, and administrative buildings, and there are endless masses of workers with red flags in the central squares, demanding justice and equality."

ukrsoc.204.d: "The latest news from Kharkiv is shocking in its cruelty. Local newspapers report that reactionary nationalists and Sich Striltsi arrived in Kharkiv to suppress the protests, resulting in gunshots being heard and a stampede in the central square. People's militia units have engaged in a firefight with the nationalists and so far the UVO is outnumbered and has no tactical or strategic initiative.

The revolutionaries announced the establishment of the Ukrainian Socialist Republic, and undertook a march to Kyiv.\n\nFortunately, the revolutionaries' attack was repulsed and they were driven back to the Southeast.

Under the guise of socialist slogans, the Dyrektoria power pursued policies in the interests of the capitalists, not those of the working people.

In this connection, a congress of the Central Committee of the UPSR(b) was convened in Kyiv to establish a provisional workers' and peasants' government of Ukraine until the convening of the Main Rada of Revolutionary Emissaries. One of the main issues to be decided by the congress was the election of the head of the new Soviet government.\nOf the candidates for this role is the current leader of the party, Oleksandr Shumskyi, an ardent revolutionary and true defender of the revolution. Besides him, Vasyl Ellan-Blakytnyi, a poet and revolutionary, an adherent of the Soviet system, is also a contender for the post. Of the less popular candidates, Panas Liubchenko, one of the youngest candidates, a supporter of anti-etatism and the development of collective farming, is also considered. In addition to him, the congress also nominated Levko Kovaliv, an SR close to the Borotbysts, who joined the revolutionary forces along with other leftist SRs from the central stream of the UPSR."

In addition, they pointed to the absolute incompetence of the previous government in land reform. In addition to Skrypnyk, Mykola Khvylovyi and Yuri Lapchynskyi, who were considered by the court to be \"Skrypnyk's accomplices\", were also indicted.\n\nAs a result, the Court pronounced the sentence: to sentence Skrypnyk, Khvylovyi, Lapchynskyi, and 12 others to death by shooting as enemies of the Ukrainian people."

Today the first socialist government of independent Ukraine was officially formed - the Main Rada (Council) of Revolutionary Emissaries.

Despite the apparent prohibition of private enterprise and private ownership, the Rada, in cooperation with the Emissary of Agriculture, has prepared a number of possible entities with the main emphasis on the collectivity of these formations. First of all, peasants are recommended to form cooperatives, for which special privileges are introduced. In addition to cooperatives, a program will also be developed to introduce state-owned estates on which collective farming will be carried out."

ukrsoc.222.d: "During the revolution, a number of generals who led rebel divisions in Ukraine came over to our side, but although they shared our ideas and we fought with them for the same goal, their autonomy could not be called satisfactory. First, and most importantly, their divisions and battalions do not conform to the model of the Chervona Armia, to which they should conform. Our armed forces must be united in defending the frontiers of our country, and for this, order and discipline must reign in the army."
ukrsoc.222.a: "They should be organized on the model of the Red Army!"

ukrsoc.223.t: "The Red Otamans"
ukrsoc.223.d: "In spite of our quite fair demands to streamline the divisions according to the Chervona Armia model, not all the generals followed this demand. Unofficially, these soldiers are known as \"Red Otamans\" - that is, the leaders of the rebel divisions fighting for socialist ideals. In reality, however, many of them have their own programs, extending not only to the organization of the rebel divisions under their control, but also to the territory in which they are stationed and operate. This state of affairs cannot continue for long, but the Rada of the Revolutionary Emissaries has no unanimity in dealing with this situation. Some demand immediate subjugation of the Red Otamans, others insist on the advisory nature of the demands, so as not to provoke the already disgruntled generals too much. Others propose to grant them autonomy in some matters in return for loyalty to the government. A number of high-ranking generals of the Red Army suggest that they should be forced into submission and repressed in case of disobedience."

The others assume this option to be too radical and just suggest to form coalitions with Poale Zion on the local levels, in local Radas and Trade Unions.

Publicly opposing the Dyrektoria all these years and months, they decided to stab the Republican government in the back and tried to organize an uprising in the South and Southeast. So far they have managed to contain them, but peasants and workers, drugged by the propaganda of the Borotbyst ideas, are rebelling all over the country.\n\nOtaman and the new government must take all urgent measures to suppress the uprising, or the future of Ukraine will be in jeopardy."

A number of politicians from the leading parties: the UPSR, USDRP, ULD(S-F), UPSS and others have already expressed their agreement to form a united anti-Borotbyst front. \n\nAnother option is to propose an alliance to Andriy Melnyk, the leader of the Galician Sich Striltsi and an ally of the Dyrektoria. In this way, we would gain the support of Ukrainian nationalists and elite armed forces, which would easily help us in the fight against the Borotbysts.\n\nThe last option is to make concessions to the Borotbysts. An option that seems impossible and would call into question the authority of Petliura. However, this is the only option that will help to solve all the issues peacefully."

However, during his 20-minute long speech in Rada not everyone was supportive of such ideas. A lot of deputies, especially the ones from the USDRP, as well as some Petliura loyalists considered these proposal undemocratic.

Moreover, all armed groups of the Borotbysts are just regular bandits, who do not have any right to own weapons or use them. While all sides understand this stance, sometimes the Petliurivtsi manage to either negotiate or force the Borotbyst divisions to give up and be disarmed.

However, their domination will eventually end, as loyalists of Central Government and supporters of Petliura's policies, who are rather suspicious of Borotbysts have seized control over one of the plants last weekend. Those people, also coming from the working class, understand all the damage that can be produced by the Borotbysts and therefore, claimed their allegiance to the legitimate government of Otaman Petliura."

ukrsoc.262.d: "The Borotbyst leadership has once again officially appealed to us with the demands to implement full socialization, mainly of land and factories, which in their opinion is the real drawback of our government. By forcefully seizing the lands and factories from the peasants and workers only to transfer them to the 'people's ownership', we will anger not only the Kulaks, but regular proletariat and peasantry as well, so that is a step that Otaman and his government will never take."
ukrsoc.262.a: "We hear their demands. Let them hear our 'No!'"

ukrsoc.263.t: "Formation of Soviet Divisions"
ukrsoc.263.d: "With some of our regions under the control of Borotbysts, they have announced mobilisation, at least mostly voluntary by now, but it still is considered a major threat by the central government. The Soviet divisions, formed by Borotbysts are now appearing in many regions, and we must be sure that they will attack us when the time comes. With this in mind, Otaman has announced additional measures to counter Borotbysts, especially considering our military equipment and training."
ukrsoc.263.a: "This is becoming a dangerous trend."

ukrsoc.264.d: "Not only Borotbysts form separate army at the other side of the so-called 'frontline', but also agitate at our soldiers in order to change their allegiance. These fools and traitors listen to the lies of Shumskyi and Blakytnyi and desert to join the rebels. This is now becoming a dangerous threat with more and more soldiers joining the enemy, sometimes even whole divisions have to be disbanded because of their treacherous behavior."

ukrsoc.265.t: "Meeting In Myrhorod"
ukrsoc.265.d: "At the initiative of infantry general Ivan Zubkovskyi in 1917 a health resort was opened near Myrhorod's eastern city borders, near the beautiful mixed forests of pines and birches. The water of Myrhorod springs belongs to the low-mineral sodium chloride waters and is close in composition to the mineral waters of the leading European spas such as Baden-Baden or Aachen. \n\nHowever, a couple of years ago the quite popular place now looks rather neglected. A couple of kilometers to the south was already the field headquarters of the Borotbyst Chervona Armia, and in the nearby town itself, Red Flags were flying and looting and rioting were rampant. \n\nBeautiful Poltava region, Otaman's native land! This was the place chosen by the initiators of the meeting of the two commanders-in-chief. A meeting that was to determine the fate of Ukraine. Petliura was the first to appear. However, soon a motorcade pulled up to the health resort, out of which a Borotbyst delegation led by the self-proclaimed leader of the South - Oleksandr Shumskyi emerged."

ukrsoc.266.t: "Tiutiunnyk's Mission"
ukrsoc.266.d: "Yuri Tiutiunnyk, one of the greatest supporters of Dyrektoria, has quite left-leaning views, which is not a secret to most governmental officials and public political figures. He is known as an unconditional Ukrainian patriot, but he is sympathetic to both sides and that is why he was chosen as the main \"ambassador\" and mediator, usually unofficial in view of the mutual non-recognition of the sides to each other, between the Otaman Petliura headquarters and the Borotbysts. \n\nWith a mission to establish contact and offer a high-level meeting to discuss terms, Tyutyunnik traveled to the heart of \"Borotbyst Ukraine\" in order to arrange with Shumskyi for a meeting with Petliura. \n\nIf Tiutiunnyk's mission succeeds, we will be able to establish close contact with Shumskyi and possibly negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict, but a peaceful solution is unlikely unless Otaman yields to these socialists at most."

ukrsoc.366.t: "Hi-Bred Corn and American Agrarian Allies"
ukrsoc.366.d: "Deepening our connections with the Americans, Khruschev has kept close contact with Iowa-born Progressive Leftist, academic, and corn biologist Henry Wallace, whose own expertise and business connections have led him to create his own corny empire in the American heartlands. Created in 1926 by Wallace, his brother James, and a group of investors from his home state of Iowa, the Hi-Bred Corn Company is aimed at the creation of the perfect corn seed culture, and thus the perfect corn crop. This noble goal is pursued through use of selective breeding, early genetic modification techniques, and the application of genetically modified pollinator species, like certain insects, as well as the creation of special pesticides/herbicides. By working with these American masters of corn, we shall further our own knowledge and deepen our mastery over corn, but that is not all we have gained from this cooperation. \n\nTaking these ideas, Khruschev, Wallace, and their fellow corn-addicts across the globe have begun to work together to create an international regulatory bureau to oversee and manage the hybridization and genetic modification of corn worldwide, ensuring that all tampering with the noble corn plant - the lifeblood of our nation and the wider human species - is done so in a way fitting to our pure standards. However, a debate has arisen internally in this new bureau - nicknamed Pioneer Hi-Bred International by the Wallace brothers - as to the scope of our watchdog and management efforts. Henry Wallace and his company have been known to tamper not only with corn, but with other foodstuffs - particularly chickens - in order to create healthier, larger, and more efficient consumables for the world, and from this variety arises the debate. Many loyal to Khrushev declare that the bureau should only focus on corn so that our attention and expertise are not sullied or divided, and so that we can focus on our true obsession without deviation or increased risk of error, while others believe we should not ‘put all our ears of corn in one basket’, as it were and instead pursue a more varied nutritional foundation. Though we shall continue to work with our partners for the betterment of the hungry masses, we need to decide on a scope for this specific effort; should we only focus on the bioengineering of corn, or should we branch out?."

Planning a tour of their largest corn farms and agriculture facilities or fields, Khruschev wishes to implement many of their successes and new technologies or techniques back at home so that our own corn production can skyrocket like it has here in the New World where this lovely golden starchy vegetable first originated. Touring the States and their farms, Khrushev quickly became giddy and corny as he was filled with joy and delight upon first seeing America’s golden fields o’ plenty waving in the wind, and as such has planned to capstone this enlightening visit with a bang. \n\nAs such, Khruschev’s visit will ultimately culminate in a large diplomatic dinner aimed at uniting the various local facets of the wider global Agrarian Socialist cause. To be held in the Americans’ newly rebuilt capital, Khruschev and his entourage plan for this feast to be cornier and more extravagant than anything the world has seen before, inviting local Agrarian Socialists like Jack Reed, Norman Thomas, Norman Wallace Lermond, William Z.. Foster, Upton Sinclair, Henry Wallace, Earl Browder, and many others, including visiting Socialists of the wider New World dedicated to our agrarian cause like Pancho Villa of Mexico, Jacques Roumain of Haiti, and James Woodsworth of Canada, in order to ensure the dinner is a success, both in taste and in our main goal of fostering of lasting diplomatic ties. \n\nIn order to share the love and bounty of our corn harvests, Khruschev and his corny delegates brought with them wonders of Slavic corn-based cuisine, from corn and crab salad to Eastern European-style corn puffs. Bringing their own dishes as well, our new allies helped us set the table for a truly corny feast, with Pancho Villa and his band of ejidos farmers bringing their delicious corn tortillas and fried or grilled elote, or street corn, while the delegates from Haiti have brought their creamy mais moulin (or mayi moulen) - a local Haitian delicacy of creamed and spiced cornmeal. Not wishing to be ‘out-corned,’ the Canucks have brought their own take on corn pops and corn cakes to try and compete with the Americans and their vast, nearly-unending array of corn-based dishes. From corn fritters, popcorn, and corn chowders to cornbreads, corn chips, and even just plain, buttered corn on the cob, this feast shall hopefully be the first of many as the cornbaskets of the Socialist world band together in order to drive humanity towards proletarian paradise through the widely loved and delicious vehicle that is corn!"

Despite the obvious typo to many, the secretaries took this at face value. Frightened to point out the Vozhd's mistake, they decided that in this way Nikita Sergeyevich expressed his opinion about renaming the party, and that it was better not to anger him without cause, but simply to officially record that the party now bears the name of its great leader.\n\nThe shuddering situation has already generated a lot of jokes and really made our citizens' day!"

The future of our Leftist and corn-based agrarian ways must be protected and future loyal prosperity be assured, and as such, this program shall mobilize the youthful masses of Khrushchev’s Ukraine and put them to work in our corn-based agriculture process so that they may embrace the ideals of labor and the revolution through firsthand experience.

ukreco.5.t: "The Mitteleuropan Question"
ukreco.5.d: "Our cooperation with Germany has led to the agricultural crisis - the fact, which is undoubtedly accepted by the Hetman and his supporters. He well remembers the previous crisis in 1919, when the Hetmanate was at the great risk of famine because of the Germans. The almost unaffordable demands for grain supplies from Austria and Germany led to the fact that the peasants had practically nothing left, which led to the aggravation of their situation, the strengthening of opposition to the Hetman, the growth of anarchism, banditry and crime. Fortunately, famine was avoided then. If we do not terminate our contracts with Germany now, which actually provide benefits for trade with us to all the countries of Mitteleurope, we may find ourselves in a similar situation again. It is necessary to act immediately, while Germany is weak and cannot fight back against us. We must immediately get out of the economic bloc and raise the prices of our goods, and we don’t care where they get the money for it."
ukreco.5.a: "We should leave the Mitteleuropa."
ukreco.5.b: "This will probably only damage us."

ukreco.6.t: "Ukrainian Government Terminates Brotfrieden!"
ukreco.6.d: "The Ukrainian government has undertaken a new foreign economic doctrine aimed at protecting their sovereignty and interests. As part of this doctrine, practically the first decision of their government was the abolition of the "Bread Peace" which had been in effect since 1918 and which effectively guaranteed the independence of the Ukrainian state from the Central Powers. Thanks to the Bread Peace, tens of thousands of German and Austro-Hungarian soldiers received foodstuffs that were critically lacking. The tariffs had been in effect for nearly 20 years, but now the Breadbasket of Europe had decided to manage its own resources and set prices on the market. Such a drastic change in the volume and quantity of supplies could not but affect the supply of our army and even the civilian population, and we must take decisive measures in response."

ukreco.10.c: "Refuse the demands and embargo Ukraine!"

ukreco.11.t: "Ukrainian Policies Provoke Food Shortage"
ukreco.11.d: "The new foreign economic doctrine to suspend preferential food supplies has severely hit our allies, including us. Our market was unprepared for the sharp rise in food prices and led to food shortages. Economists predict that the shortage will last at least a year until the market fully recovers and adapts to the new prices."
ukreco.11.a: "Hope we will recover soon."

ukreco.12.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agrees!"
ukreco.12.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government agreed to our terms.

ukreco.13.t: "Mitteleuropa Encounters Bread Crisis!"
ukreco.13.d: "Because of Ukraine's new foreign economic policy, the government took steps to break up the so-called \"Bread Peace\", which largely predetermined the Central Powers' victory in the Weltkrieg by supplying German and Austro-Hungarian soldiers with Ukrainian grain and food at reduced prices.\n\nGermany's colonial policy toward Ukraine has caused a series of political and economic crises, but now the Ukrainian government is finally strong enough to tell its former masters that the \"Breadbasket of Europe\" will now determine to whom and for how much its products are delivered. The countries of Mitteleuropa and the Austrian sphere have already faced the first consequences in the form of food shortages to supply their armies."

ukreco.15.t: "Economic Self-Confidence"
ukreco.15.d: "Since 1918, we have been critically dependent on German consumer goods to fill our markets. Indeed, many in our nationalist government have postulated that this state of affairs is an intentional part of the Reich’s plans to castrate us and turn us into little more than a pathetic puppet, hopelessly reliant on them. On account of our dependency, our farmers aren’t able to develop their own businesses and compete with well-funded German freeholders, many of whom hold key positions in our economy. We have to reconstruct our national agriculture market and end this shameful dependence on the German Empire. This is no time for diplomatic niceties."
ukreco.15.a: "Announce an embargo on German goods!"
ukreco.15.b: "There is no reason to resort to economic warfare."

ukreco.16.t: "Ukrainian Embargo"
ukreco.16.d: "The new Ukrainian government has decided to intentionally reduce our participation in their domestic markets through a series of draconian trade measures, equating in effect to a near-total embargo on our goods. This poses a major problem for our farmers because Ukraine was a big and perspective outlet for their products. Furthermore, we have traditionally been reliant on Ukrainian grain to feed our armed forces. This behaviour by Ukraine is unbelievable considering all we have done for them!"
ukreco.16.a: "Demand a reversal of this outrageous embargo!"
ukreco.16.b: "We can stomach this indignity."

ukreco.17.t: "German Empire Demands an End to the Embargo"
ukreco.17.d: "Our unexpected embargo shocked and angered the German government due to its effects on the Reich’s agricultural sector and their need for our grain to serve their military. The Germans have demanded that we immediately end our protectionist trade measures or else they will begin to strip us of our Reichspakt membership. This embargo has begun to strengthen our economic self-sufficiency and power, but being thrown out of the Reichspakt suddenly may be harmful to us. What should we do?"
ukreco.17.a: "Comply and remove the embargo."
ukreco.17.b: "Maintain the embargo, we must protect our peasants!"

ukreco.18.t: "First Results of the Embargo"
ukreco.18.d: "Our decision to impose an effective embargo on German goods to help our national producers has thankfully led to a stabilisation in our agricultural sector. Perhaps 18% of the state and private farms can now be called self-supporting. As a result we can solve more difficult problems in our economy, since we have support in the villages and farms."

ukreco.30.t: "The Kerch Bridge"
ukreco.30.d.intro: "The first person who seriously thought about building a bridge across the Kerch strait was naval officer and engineer V.D. Mendeleev, the son of the creator of the periodic table of chemical elements D.I. Mendeleev. His work \"Project of raising the level of the Sea of Azov by damming the Kerch Strait\" was published in 1899, after the death of the author.\n\nAt the beginning of the XX century in the Russian Empire were working on projects for the construction of a railway bridge across the Kerch Strait. Two possible routes were proposed: the northern one, between the Kerch Peninsula and the Chushka Spit, and the southern one, passing through the Tuzla Spit. With the permission of Nicholas II in 1910, the planning of the southern route began, but the outbreak of World War I prevented the creation of a railroad across the strait."
ukreco.30.d.ukr: "$ukreco.30.d.intro$\nNow the government has finally outlined the project and is ready to start the construction. With the new agreements between Kuban and Ukraine the chance to 'reunite' our two countries by land is finally highly likely!"

For almost a year the workers of both Kuban and Ukraine were busy working hard for the good of their countries, but now thanks to them the first train has already passed over the new railroad bridge.

ukrmisc.1.d: "Hetmanate is a period of our history, inextricably linked with the Zaporizhian Cossacks. And although this period was difficult and ambiguous, it is with the Cossacks that we associate the history of the statehood of the Ukrainian state. Today, a monument to the Zaporizhian Cossacks was opened near Cherkassy. The opening was attended by Hetman Skoropadskyi himself, who made a speech and spoke about the importance of historical memory. Among the audience was also the headman of the Kyiv Governorate, Pavlo Adrianov, who also made a speech. \n\nThis is not the first monument to the Hetmanate opened in the last 15 years. Ukrainization is in full swing and we can only hope that soon our people will find their true national consciousness."

For a long time, the former unofficial national Christian holiday, now July 7 is officially considered a day off.\n\nThe night of Ivan Kupala is filled with rituals related to water, fire and herbs. The main part of Kupala rituals is performed at night. It is considered mandatory for the holiday to swim before sunset. Closer to sunset, bonfires are lit on the hills or by the rivers. On the night of Ivan Kupala, the "betrothed" are chosen and marriage rites are performed: jumping over the fire, holding hands, exchanging wreaths, searching for a fern flower and bathing in the morning dew.\n\nDespite the fact that official events with the participation of high-ranking officials are not held, ordinary Ukrainian people in villages celebrate this ancient holiday with pleasure."

ukrmisc.3.t: "'Ivan Ilyich'"
ukrmisc.3.d: "A new play by Mikhail Bulgakov, \"Ivan Ilyich\", appeared today on the posters. The plot is based on castling in time, when due to a malfunction of the machine invented by engineer Tymofeenko, the Kyiv housekeeper Koretskyi, together with the crook Zhorzh Myloslavskyi, move to the XVIII century, and Hetman Ivan Skoropadskyi falls into the XX century. Almost vaudeville confusion leads to the creation of numerous comic situations in which the characters, who find themselves in \"alien\" eras, live according to the laws of their time. \n\nIt turns out that Koretskyi is surprisingly similar to the Hetman, which is noticed by Myloslavskyi, who, posing as Prince Golytsyn, convinces Koretskyi to play the role of Hetman. Koretskyi, being an ardent supporter of modern politics, causes insurmountable horror among the Cossacks by publicly renouncing Peter the Great and his 'Muscovy' and declaring an alliance with the Teutons.\n\nAt the same time in XX Century Kyiv, Hetman Skoropadskyi at first rejoices to learn that his descendant rules the country, but then he is horrified to learn that the Austrian Archduke is sitting at the head of the country as a King, and German garrisons are walking around the city. \n\nThe play ends with everything falling back into place, and Tymofeenko wakes up. However, the ending remains open, giving viewers to wonder if all this really happened."

ukrmisc.4.d: "Ukrainian film director Oleksandr Dovzhenko, the founder of Ukrainian cinema, has released his masterpiece - a film based on the famous story of Mykola Hohol about the Zaporizhian Cossacks. Critics have already praised the film, saying that it is the best that the director has shot in his career.\n\nDovzhenko declared himself as an interesting and original master in 1928 with the film \"Zvenyhora\", where episodes of Ukrainian history were intertwined with scenes of the Civil War, where revolutionary epic, satire and lyrics were combined. According to critics, "Zvenyhora" marked the birth of Ukrainian cinema as an art. In 1929, Dovzhenko shot \"Arsenal\", the story of the uprising of the workers of the Kyiv factory in 1918. Then he himself took part in those riots, though on the other side, but in the film he seems to repent that he was blinded by Bolshevik fairy tales. In this film Dovzhenko continued to create his own unique language at the junction of poetic and realistic cinema. In terms of the scope and epicness of the action, Arsenal is not inferior to Zvenyhora - masses of people, many ordinary deaths and one grandiose one in the finale of the film, when the hero takes a blow from the enemy with his bare chest."

ukrmisc.5.t: "A Stunning Concert in Berlin"
ukrmisc.5.d: "One of the most famous symphonic ensembles in Eastern Europe, the State Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine, created in 1918 and approved by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, gave a stunning performance in Berlin today. Under the direction of conductor Oleksandr Gorilyi, the orchestra played the symphonies of Beethoven, Brahms and Schubert beautifully. Apparently, impressionable German viewers remember last year’s tour of the countries of Mittel Europe and Austria-Hungary, with sold-out tickets and full stalls and amphitheaters. This year the triumph was repeated.\n\nThe National Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine will be a real creative laboratory of Ukrainian composers and conductors. For example, upon returning to Kyiv, the orchestra is preparing to once again play a masterpiece of Ukrainian music - the opera \"Golden Hoop\" by the teacher of the Kyiv Conservatory, Ukrainian composer, Borys Liatoshynskyi."

At the initiative of the Germans for the development of the defense capability of Ukraine, a group for the study of missile movement was created, in fact - the state scientific and design laboratory for the development of missile aircraft. To date, projects have already been developed for liquid cruise and long-range ballistic missiles, aircraft missiles for firing at air and ground targets and anti-aircraft solid-fuel missiles.\n\nAccording to the confessions of the youngest aircraft designer, he dreams of a human flight into space and believes that this is possible in the near future.

ukrmisc.11.d: "Mishka Yaponchik is a well-known Odesa criminal who has been terrorizing Odesa residents for many years and escaping from the authorities in an amazing way every time. \nIn 1917, he was released on amnesty, organized a large gang of raiders and became the "thunderstorm of Odesa". Already in the autumn of 1917, the gang of a Yaponchik made a number of daring raids, including robbing a Romanian gambling club during the day. On New Year’s Day in 1918, Goldstein’s store and the sugar factory owner Yu. Gepner were robbed. At the same time, Yaponchik organized the so-called Jewish Revolutionary Self-Defense Squad under the pretext of fighting possible pogroms and issued a \"proclamation\" calling for robbing \"only the bourgeoisie and officers.\" In November 1917, one of the robbers was even killed by the Yaponchik himself for robbing a worker.\nHe established contacts with the Odesa anarchist movement and in early December 1917, a group of so-called \"anarchist-rippers\" (\"rippers off the bourgeoisie\") appeared in Odesa, who staged a powerful explosion on Deribasovskaya Street in 1917, demanding an end to lynching of captured bandits. Later the bandits seized Eisenberg’s brothel on Dvoryanskaya Street, setting up their headquarters there.\nIn January 1918, Yaponchik’s squad, together with the Bolsheviks, anarchists and left SRS, participated in street battles. The bandits took advantage of these events to raid the Registration Bureau of the police, during which a card file for 16 thousand Odesa criminals was burned.\nAt the beginning of 1919, he actively collaborated with the Bolshevik underground. During the Civil War, the Yaponchik gang committed many new daring robberies, also engaged in kidnappings and racketeering. A number of entrepreneurs who did not want to pay the bandits were killed. In February 1919, a daring raid was made on a Civil public meeting of Odesa during a gala dinner, the apartment of Duchess Lyubomirskaya and the room of the Spanish consul at the Londonskyi Hotel were also robbed. Yaponchik invested the money earned from crime in real business: he bought the most luxurious restaurant in Odesa. A casino and a brothel functioned under him.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, this open banditry of Yaponchik ended and he lay low, successfully eluding the Derzhavna Varta. However, recently our valiant law enforcement officers managed to raid an underground casino, presumably owned by Yaponchik. Unfortunately, once again, he himself was not there."

It was there that some varieties of Crimean port, madeira, and sherry were produced. The high quality of the wine was achieved by blending different grape varieties. In 1837 , the quality of Masandra wines was highly appreciated by the Russian Emperor Nicholas I.\n\nToday Masandra is the oldest wine cellar in the region. The main basement, built in 1897, consists of seven tunnels. The length of each of them is 150 meters and the width is 5 meters. Tunnels fan out from the central gallery. They always maintain a constant air temperature of 10-12 ° C, that is, the best for aging wine.\n\nIn Masandra there are the oldest main wineries for long-term aging and processing of wines, the first wine of its own production was laid in 1898.\n\nAfter several years of relative desolation, the region is now developing again due to state subsidies for wine production and the development of health complexes in the Crimea.

It was the Yuzivka sports society that held the first international match in Donbas - in the autumn of 1924, the workers of the German national team were defeated 5-0. The Hetman government decided to develop sports in Ukraine, and a large amount of funds began to be poured into Yuzivka.\n\nToday, Yuzivka Sports Society is one of the leading football teams in the country.

The film, which was conceived to be an answer to the Bulgakov’s 'White Guard' doesn’t try to point out possible methods of reconciliation, but raises by implication the potential for separatists and spies of foreign powers to still be hiding among the Ukrainian population and both willing and able to try to exploit its weakness."

ukrmisc.24.d: "Before the outbreak of World War I, the Hellenic community of the Azov region lived rather isolated, not particularly interested in political trends. The revolution in the Priazv region came later than in other Ukrainian lands, so it was not very actively supported. This is due to ethnic and social peculiarities of the population of the region, the proximity of the Ukrainian-Russian border and the lack of authoritative representatives of Ukrainian political forces. \nAt the end of October 1917, the Central Rada recognized for the peoples who inhabited the Ukrainian lands \"a national-personal autonomy to ensure their rights and freedom of self-government in matters of their national life\".\nHowever, at the same time, the Central Rada abolished land ownership. Most of the Greek peasants had a lot of land in their estates, so this approach did not satisfy them. This further undermined the already low authority of the Ukrainian local authorities. The leading role in the creation of the Mariupol Union of Hellenes was played by the Greek commercial bourgeoisie, the liberal circles of the Greek intelligentsia, and the well-off Greek peasants. On November 10, 1917 a meeting of representatives of the volost Greek communities was held in Mariupol, which began the establishment of the Mariupol Union of the Hellenes. It was headed by a respected Hellenic leader Illia Pichakhchy. According to its organizers, the association of Mariupol Greeks had to protect the national interests of the Hellenic community in the difficult circumstances. However. the history of the Mariupol Union of Hellenes ended there - soon the congress was dispersed by German troops.\nNow, when words about administrative reform are heard again from the rostrum of the new Rada, Pichakhchy announced the reconstitution of the Mariupol Union of Hellenes and demanded that the government give the Greeks autonomy."

His crops and the crops of his forefathers grew plump and verdant in the fertile soil - soil fertilized by blood and tilled by hardowrking, free, and equal men under the brilliant leadership of Bat’ko Nestor Makhno and his anarchist utopia - but these bright and egalitarian times have long since passed. A new age dawned in these lands following the chaos of the German Intervention, and for years since, these fields have only languished and grown fallow as the new overlords of our once-proud Ukraine - the vile Austrians and Prussians - mishandle the state time and time again. \n\nUkraine weeps, and Mother Anarchy cries for her lost sons as once again the Germanics have proven their inability to run our land and rule our people. With the fallout of Black Monday and the following agricultural crisis caused by Germany’s blind and reckless economic strategies, Ukraine has once again plummeted into chaos. The people have been pushed to the brink, and are once again at each other’s throats as the economy comes crashing down upon our heads, all thanks to Hetman Skoropadskyi kowtowing to the so-called ‘Hegemon’. Even more frustrating, in this time of extreme circumstances, those still loyal to our new overlords have only benefitted while the rest of Ukraine - our Ukraine - has fallen to the dogs. The lowly peasant who tills his mucky soil has only fallen on harder times while his neighbor - an estate farmer down the road loyal to the German-backed Hetmanate - has only prospered, building himself a prosperous and gorgeous farm despite the raging inferno of economic decay that oppresses the true common man of Ukraine. Incidents like these have only caused more resentment to bubble and fester within the working-class masses of our Ukraine, and the hills and swamps of our homeland have once again begun to whisper of better times and more egalitarian, familiar ideas. Though our Bat’ko may be in exile hundreds of miles away to the West, the teachings and ideas of our beloved Father have only begun to grow more popular with each passing day in this ever-worsening maelstrom. Perhaps the ideas of the Black Army are not so dead after all..."

The people are hardworking here, cultivating anything that grows, especially the sugar beet. The forests of the Bila Tserkva region amaze with their grandeur and the development of the local lumber camps and sawmills are natural to the local economy. Moreover, the Ukrainian Academy of Science since its establishment has been organizing archeology expeditions here, trying to find even more ancient signs of people habitat.

The capital of the Hetmanate was also located here - in the place of Baturin, the residence of the hetmans. In 1708, Baturin, the capital of Ukraine, which was rebellious at that time, was completely destroyed by Muscovite troops, and most of the inhabitants were killed. This land preserves the history of Ukraine, and therefore the King was invited to assist in the restoration of the native Ukrainian Cossacks, which is engaged in the organization Vilne Kozatstvo.\nLocal geologists are also inclined to believe that there are deposits of natural resources on Chernihiv land, namely oil and gas, which would bring additional sources of fuel for our country.

Volhynia was almost the most developed part of Western Rus. But by the end of the 13th century, as we know, the Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia could not withstand the endless struggle with its much more powerful neighbors. If in the 1260s, King Danylo defeated Mindaugas and annexed the lands up to Novohrudok, by the beginning of the 14th century the Volyn could not oppose the Lithuania any more. That is when the ways of Galicia and Volhynia diverged: the first went to Poland, and the latter to Lithuania.\nWith its incorporation into Muscovy, Volyn, like Podillia, remained an inconspicuous region on the outskirts of the empire, a land of Jewish settlements, Russian garrisons, Polish landlords, and Ukrainian peasants. In addition, the Volyn province included almost all of Polissia, almost the most remote corner of the empire west of Moscow.\nThe development of the region never truly restarted even in the modern times - now it is one of the least industrialized and prosperous of all Ukraine.

Since the ancient times the land was a cherry on the cake for various peoples because of its fertile lands. Being a core region of the first Hetmanate, it is also known for the Poltava Battle, a decisive and largest battle of the Great Northern War, and a national tragedy for the Ukrainians.\nHowever, the land became the most prosperous of all Ukrainian regions, with a powerful Ukrainian movement, never fully suppressed. There were many noble descendants of Cossack elders in the Poltava region, and local landowners had strong positions due to fertile soils and the growth of trade with the newly colonized southern lands (local fairs were of great importance). Among the local elites, the ideas of Taras Shevchenko and the Cyril and Methodius Society resonated, and until the revolution of 1917, the Poltava region remained one of the main centers of public life of Ukrainians.\nNow, the regions is slowly becoming the industrial center, with Kremenchuk city welcoming more and more labour force from the East, South and West. With a clear possibility to industrialize this region even more, the future of Poltavshchyna seems good and profitable."

Along the edge of Podillia are the Trajan’s ramparts, marking the border of the Roman Empire. The life of the legionnaires here was probably not much different from that of the Soviet and Cossack garrisons in Central Asia and the Far East - a foreign land where only war can save you from deathly ennui. After the Romans, the Ost-Goths, who were brought here by King Philimer, lived here. Through Podolia passed nomads - Huns, Sarmatians, Magyars and others. It was also a frontier of the Kingdom of Rus against the Tatar hordes. But despite the eternal war, Podolia attracted people. Peasants - the undeveloped black earth, merchants - the position at the crossroads of trade roads\nPodillia is a hilly plateau, dissected by deep river valleys, sometimes in the form of real canyons. Its hilly terrain promoted the development of cattle breeding, but the agriculture in the fields was developed as well.

A vivid symbol of the cultural unity of the Hetmanate and Sloboda Ukraine was the great Ukrainian philosopher Hryhorii Skovoroda, a native of the Lubensky Regiment and a pupil of the Kyiv Academy, professor of the Pereyaslavsky and later Kharkiv Collegium, whose activities and creativity were deeply connected with Sloboda Ukraine.\nNow, with the center in Kharkiv, this region is industrialized and prosperous.

He draws attention to Korney's giftedness. At first, Kornei refuses to sell the paintings, but at the entreaties of Rita, who dreams of escaping from the countryside, gives in, and they go to town. The famous critic Mulin, having seen Kornei's paintings, is delighted with his rustic paintings and calls him "the master of primitivism". Fame and temptation descend upon Kornei: Vera, an elegant young socialite, writes a flattering article about the young artist and introduces Kornei to the local bohemian society.\nMeanwhile, Rita gets pregnant, and the couple get married. Vera comments with patronizingly disparaging sarcasm: the artist who married is dead to art. After such a characterization, Kornei's paintings are not in demand. At this time, the child becomes seriously ill, the money received earlier is spent on expensive treatment. And then the critic Mulin, who has long had his eye on Rita, convinces her to leave the pauper artist for him. Rita, hoping that this will stir up Korney's jealousy and talent, agrees. For some time, Korney remains strangely inactive, but he soon goes headlong into his art, once again achieving recognition. He recaptures Rita... and at the same time is unable to forgive her betrayal.\nThe sudden death of a child brings them together in grief, Rita and Kornei realize that life in the city has not brought them happiness, and decide to return to the village.\nMost of the film met only positive reviews."

Cherkasskyi, and from 1918 worked as an artist-decorator in Vinnytsia theater at Matvei Drak for the troupe of Hnat Yura, Amvrosiy Buchma and Marian Krushelnitskyi. From 1921 he became an artist in the Vinnytsia provincial department of the Commission for the Protection of Monuments of Art and Antiquity - formed for the city museum gallery and library from the collection of Duchess Branitskaia in the manor in Nemyriv. In 1923 he entered Kyiv Art Institute, Faculty of Painting, worked as a theater artist, and in 1925 transferred to the first course of the Faculty of Architecture. \n\nHowever, his career as an architect was rather limited. He participated in the design of various buildings in Kyiv, but was never in a managerial position. Now the projects provided by the young architect struck the Kyiv Rada.

He defended the idea of an ensemble development of the area, taking into account the peculiarities of topography and environment, rather than the creation of random, unsuitable to each other or to a selected area of buildings. Here is how he himself described his design:\n\n\"From the viewpoint of the Dnieper River, the houses of the new residential complex are perceived as a picturesque silhouette on the background of greenery and water. Silhouette from the Dnieper does not have an independent character and fits into the landscape as part of it.\"\n\nArchitectural dominant of the quarter is a 10-storey apartment building in the style of constructivism.

In later years the chancellery of Kyiv governor-general, whose residence was located on the opposite side of Institutskaya Street, was placed there. In 1886 the authorities decided to sell the estate, dividing it into three plots. The most part of the estate on the corner of Instytutska and Sadova streets was given to Oleksandr Brodskyi, a cousin of Kyiv "sugar kings" Lev and Lazar Brodsky, the founder and director of South-Russian Society of Breweries, the first director of Kyiv Bacteriological Institute. \n\nHowever, after the Dyrektoria came to power, the site was nationalized and Brodskyi's mansion was demolished. The plot in its place was given to Karakis as a new canvas for his work. Knowing very well the architecture of the Kyiv houses, Iosyp Karakis used for the first time in his residential construction an internal staircase with an upper light, traditional for Kyiv in the past. To prove the validity of such a solution, the author decided to measure the lighting of the stairwell in the building. When the architect came in with a cumbersome luxmeter and saw the security guard reading a letter from home at the stairs, he realized that the need for any measurements was gone - there was enough light."

Designed in the Art Deco style, the department store had seven floors, high ceilings, marble staircases and an elevator. The new department store in Khreshchatyk became the second big department store in the central street after the Bessarabian covered market.

During his leadership of the city police managed to keep the situation under control, to bring elementary order in the city, to put the city police to the proper level, to strengthen the discipline of personnel.\nLater he became one of the most talented detectives in Russia. Moving to Moscow, he inherited a well-oiled, smoothly operating investigative apparatus (in 1913 the Moscow Investigative Police was recognized as the best in Europe), and worthy successor to his predecessor.\n\nIn 1917, after the revolutionary events in Russia, one of the first steps of the new government was the abolition of the gendarmes and the police, which was replaced by the police. In the criminal investigation was without professionals in their field, so the new government still attracted the old cadres. Karl Marshalk, who was in charge of the search police in Moscow, also remained in service. One can imagine under what conditions he and others had to work, especially after the Kerensky's government announced a complete amnesty for criminals, releasing them from prison and thus bringing to naught all the work of pre-revolutionary detectives.\n\nAfter the beginning of the Red Terror in Russia, fearing for his life, he went to Ukraine and in September 1918 was appointed the city governor of Kyiv, the head of the Kyiv Derzhavna Varta (police) - the Kyiv City Otaman.\n\nThanks to the service of Karl Marshalk, the Kyiv Detective Police was now recognized as the best in Europe, at least in Mitteleuropa, which of course also had an impact on the almost total destruction of the opposition and the Borotbyst terrorists in Kyiv."

Just as long as there was meat and bread in the markets and no shooting in the streets, that, for God's sake, there were no Bolsheviks, and that the common people were not robbed. Well, all this was more or less realized under the Hetman, perhaps even to a great extent. At least, the Muscovites and St. Petersburgers and the majority of the townspeople, though they laughed at the strange Hetman's country, which they, like Captain Talberg, called an operetta, an insubstantial kingdom, praised the hetman heartily... and...

ukrmisc.57.t: "Ukrainisches Freikorps"
ukrmisc.57.d: "One of the important steps towards the creation of the second Reichspacht army was the creation of the Ukrainian Freikorps, an armed formation which could be joined by volunteers from among German soldiers who were promised land in Ukraine for their service. Hetman negotiated with Germany to create this formation in early 1919, marking the beginning of the creation of a new social class in Ukraine and, importantly, new German colonies. \n\nNevertheless, Germans had long been living in Ukraine: especially in the South and in Volhynia. In addition, the Germans have long had their own colonial settlements in the Crimea since the early 19th century, such as Neizatz, Friedenthal, Rosenthal in Simferopol district, and Heilbrun, Sudak and Herzenberg in Feodosiya district, and in the late XIX century in the Simferopol City Duma was already about 20% of the Germans, many of whom held high positions. According to the census of 1897 in the Crimea lived nearly 32 thousand Germans - 5.8% of the population of the Crimea.\n\nDespite the fact that Germans have long had their views on the Crimea, and we should obviously keep an eye on our legal peninsula, the German population has grown quite strong in Kherson, Odesa and Volyn. And quite a large number of the increase is due to Freikorps. Although a number of politicians believe that this strengthens our relationship with the Empire, many suggest that it could cause many problems in the future."

ukrmisc.58.d: "Eduard Fuks was born in Minsk Governorate in a family of a Russianized German family. While he briefly studied in St. Petersburg Mining University, he never received full education due to large price of education. Uneducated and poor he started his career at the Kryvbas mining industries, but soon he proved to be a great specialist. His authority as a specialist became undisputable, because his predictions were always correct. By 1917 he became the most qualified and respected bosom scout and he saved a lot of documents about Kryvbas mining during the civil war.\n\nThanks to his impressive work for the Ukrainian government, he recently have discovered a large pool of metalls and coal, greatly increasing our capabilities in the Kryvbas.\nBy the special decree of our Minister of Economy he was awarded the honorable medal for his hard labor."

ukrmisc.59.d: "Today it became known that a great Ukrainian scientist, lawyer, historian, diplomat and representative of the Narodnik-democratic direction of Ukrainian political thought, Serhiy Shelukhin has passed away in Kyiv at the age of 74. For many years he has served as the Judge General and General Prosecutor of the Ukrainian State, and he was an active member of the UPSF(m).\n\nSerhiy was born in 1864 in Poltava Governorate in the family of gentry, later he moved to study at the Faculty of Law of Volodymyr(Kyiv) University in order to get the profession of a lawyer, which, in his opinion, gave maximum freedom: \"...I liked the independence of judicial work and the position of a judge\".\n\nIn 1902 Serhiy moves to Odesa, where he served as a member of the Odesa Regional Court for 15 years, as well as participating in scientific and cultural work.\n\nLeaving Odesa in 1917, he soon became a General Judge during the days of the Central Rada, and when the General Court was renamed the Ukrainian Senate, he became a senator. Twice he was the Minister of Justice and at the same time the General Prosecutor of Ukraine. He became the most famous as a political figure, being the head of the delegation of Ukraine in 1918 at the negotiations with the Soviet Russia. During the period of the Hetmanate, he was a member of the State Senate for the rest of his life until he considered his retirement in 1935."

ukrmisc.60.d: "A number of deputies from the local Oleksandrivsk representation submitted a proposal to the government to rename the city, which, named after the Alexander Fortress of the Dnieper Line, laid in 1770 and according to several estimates named after Russian Prince Alexander Vyazemsky or after Russian Field Marshal General Alexander Golitsyn. In any case, the fortress was erected on the site of the Cossack settlement of Volyn Prince Dmytro Vyshnevetskyi - Khortytsia Sich. Sich is the common name of multiple Cossack fortresses. Khortytsia Sich was erected on the largest Dnieper island of Khortytsia, now located in the city limits. However, the prince himself, soon after his fortress was destroyed, fled to the Russian Tsar Ivan the Terrible.\n\nIn connection with this historical reference, which deputies also provided to the government, several renaming options are proposed: Zaporizhzhia, as the name of the area \"Za Porogami\" (\"beyond the rapids\") of the Dnieper; Khortytsia, in honor of the Cossack fortress and island in the city; Vyshnevetskyi, in honor of the prince who built the fortress but proved to be Russophile; or Sich, in honor of all of the Cossack fortresses that existed on the banks of the Dnieper."

ukrmisc.61.d: "The «Ukrainian Military Doctrine», or the 'military doctrine of Ukrainian nationalists', is a recently published book by Mykhailo Kolodzinskyi, a colonel of the UVO, that presents the strategy of the Ukrainian liberation war, that will eventually happen, since all of Ukrainians are not yet united in a single, sovereign Ukrainian state.\n\nWhile calling for pogroms and vandalism, the book also describes the future borders of the Nationalist Ukrainian state.\nThe most debatable expression from the book is: \"not to build Ukraine only over Dniester or Dnieper, but Ukraine in such dimensions, which were measured by the very Creator himself, when he gave the land its present geographical form. The East of Europe must be ours, for such a testament our great-grandfathers have compared to us\". Mykhailo Kolodzinskyi outlined the borders of the future Ukrainian state, which should include in addition to the entire modern Ukraine, Moldova, large parts of Romania, Poland, Belarus, Russia (up to the Middle Volga and the Caspian Sea), North Caucasus, Baku and Absheron peninsula with oil fields.\nHaving received much criticism as well for \"Ukrainian Imperialism\", the book is clearly inspired by Dmytro Dontsov’s teachings and to the majority of Ukrainian establishement and citizens it was just a nonsense."

ukrfor.11.d: "Despite the officially and mutually recognized borders of Belarus and Ukraine, signed by a special act with the German mediation in the early 1919, that finally allowed Ukraine to recognize Belarus de-jure, the relations between two our countries cannot be described as 'fraternal' or 'mutually beneficial', despite the fact that a significant part of the Belarusian forest found its market on the territory of Ukraine, in return for which Belarus received grain and sugar. The region of [997.GetName], which was a natural claim of Ukraine, was also claimed by the Belarus. Eventually, the Germans have decided for our nations - and splitted the region. While [93.GetName] and [241.GetName] remained an integral part of Ukraine, the regions of [95.GetName] and [194.GetName] were given to Belarus.\n\nThis caused a number of diplomatic annoyances between our nations. But as the Hetman Skoropadskyi said himself: 'Belarus is like a helmet for Ukraine', meaning that keeping good relations with our Northern neighbor is vital for our independence. With the now full independence of both our countries from the German Kaiser, it has become clear that we should sign a non-aggression pact with Belarus as soon as possible."

ukrfor.100.t: "Normalisation of German-Ukrainian Relations"
ukrfor.100.d: "The news of the overthrow of former Ukrainian government was received in Berlin with worry and mistrust. As the situation stabilised, it became clear that a full-blown syndicalist takeover was avoided. The last shots of the uprising has just fired and Ukraine is now fully controlled by the Socialist 'Dyrektoria' or Directory of the Ukrainian People's Republic. As our minister of foreign affairs has said - who controls Ukraine, controls the Eastern Europe.\n\nThe new Ukrainian government has jeopardised the sphere of influence in Eastern Europe that we have spent twenty years carefully constructing. Many hotheads in the Abwehr have suggesed direct military action to punish the new socialist government and deter other potential insurrectionists. Doing so could be extremely unwise however as Ukraine possesses one of the largest armed forces in Europe and they are critical for our long-term plans as a bulwark against a belligerent Russia. However, the some politicians, especially from the SDP have suggested to negotiate concessions with the new government in Kyiv, perhaps we can escape further bloodshed - though making too many concessions would be unpopular at home and in other parts of Mitteleuropa."
ukrfor.100.a: "We need strict guarantees - they are radicals, after all." # -> 103
ukrfor.100.b: "Let's start with some good will." # -> 102
ukrfor.100.c: "Crush the Socialist traitors!"

ukrfor.101.t: "Berlin Withdraws From Ukraine!"
ukrfor.101.d: "Following our withdrawal from the Reichspakt bloc, the German military mission present in our country since 1918 has finally fully left! Already, officers and advisers that had been stationed on the Ostwall, in Sevastopol and the capital Kyiv, have been surreptitiously evacuated over the course of the day. This is truly a testament to an independent Ukraine.\nMoreover, the German industry and business has also left, which meant immediate nationalization of their resources."
ukrfor.101.a: "The chains are broken, for now at least."

ukrfor.102.t: "German Demands: Economic Status Quo"
ukrfor.102.d: "The starting point of the negotiations has been surprisingly conciliatory. Berlin requires us to remain a Mitteleuropa member, with all the same treaties in place as before - which admittedly were one of the better things the Skoropadskyi administration had negotiated. However, this includes granting German businesses equal rights to Ukrainian ones, and assuring that they won't be nationalised nor harassed in any other way. Still, it is a way better deal than some had feared."
ukrfor.102.a: "Aim for a better deal."
ukrfor.102.b: "Better than expected."

ukrfor.103.t: "German Demands: Strict Safeguards"
ukrfor.103.d: "As a government propelled into power by a revolution, the German delegation explained, we cannot return to the same level of trust that once existed between our two governments. Thus, Berlin requires safeguards. Not only we are to return to Mitteleuropa, we also need to safeguard German property and capital in Ukraine and grant preferential treatment in trade to the German Empire. In addition, the Germans require control over the main railway lines across the country, to ensure the \"national security\" of Ukraine. Even though officially this is to ensure fast troop deployment against Russia, in truth it is also to keep pressure on the Ukrainian \"radical\" regime."
ukrfor.103.a: "These are terrible, send our best diplomats to Berlin."
ukrfor.103.b: "Better sign it..."

ukrfor.104.t: "Ukrainian Counter-Proposal"
ukrfor.104.d: "Unsatisfied with our demands, the Ukrainian delegation has arrived to haggle. They wish to change some particularly troublesome points of our agreement, such as being permitted to nationalise German-owned assets, though by paying full compensation for them. They additionally wish to avoid a too high German presence in the country and, for additional liberties, offer us more profitable export arrangements. This is obviously more important to them domestically, as they do not wish to be seen as \"selling the country to the Germans\" - the same crime they accused the Hetman's government of."
ukrfor.104.a: "Seems reasonable."
ukrfor.104.b: "They are in no position to bargain."

ukrfor.105.t: "Germans Accept Our Deal"
ukrfor.105.d: "Our delegation managed to convince Germany to lower their unreasonable demands. It is an achievement that we can sell to our domestic supporters as victory over German hegemony, or at least progress towards our eventual liberation - something that the Hetmanate never managed to achieve. As a major part of the renegotiation, the Germans dropped their demand of controlling the railway and manning them with their own soldiers, and were satisfied with the establishment of a joint committee to manage and organise the infrastructure system."
ukrfor.105.a: "Great that they saw reason."
ukrfor.105.b: "This isn't enough, perhaps we have friends in Vienna..."
ukrfor.105.c: "These terms are unacceptable!" # -> 116

ukrfor.106.t: "Germany Ignored Our Counter-Proposal!"
ukrfor.106.d: "Our negotiators did not manage to gain any real changes. The Germans gave us some token concessions, but they were mere breadcrumbs to make it look like Germans were being reasonable and not just forcing us to sign their ultimatum. If we sign it, it's not going to look very good at home - at this point, only real way to improve our situation would be backing of another major power."
ukrfor.106.a: "Let's see if we have friends in Vienna..."
ukrfor.106.b: "At least we tried."
ukrfor.106.c: "These terms are unacceptable!" # -> 116

ukrfor.107.t: "Ukrainian Railways Return Under German Control"
ukrfor.107.d: "As per the agreement with the new Ukrainian government, the main arteries of their infrastructure system have been sold to a German state company, and put under their administration. In practice this means a lasting German grip over Ukraine, with the Heer having free movement through the country - and Germany reaping financial profits from the system. It's a national humiliation for [UKR.GetNameDef], but Berlin's leadership can rest easy, having reaffirmed their grip on the east."
ukrfor.107.a: "Splendid."
ukrfor.107.b: "Necessary sacrifice."

ukrfor.108.t: "Ukraine Seeks an Alliance"
ukrfor.108.d: "In secret talks with the Ukrainian ambassador in Vienna, the possibility of an official alliance between [202.GetName] and Vienna was raised for the first time. The negotiations between Ukraine and Germany seem to have hit a stalemate, with the Ukrainians being unwilling to accept all the various unreasonable demands that the Germans are making. To escape this plight, they have suggested an alliance between the Habsburg Empire and Ukraine, reducing their dependence on Germans for protection and giving them a better hand for negotiation. This will no doubt annoy the Germans greatly... but on the other hand, they did rob us of this possibility already in 1917. This time we shouldn't let the Ukrainians down."
ukrfor.108.a: "They are welcome."
ukrfor.108.b: "They just want us to get into another foolish war."

ukrfor.109.t: "The Austro-German-Ukrainian Treaty"
ukrfor.109.d: "After it became clear that a German-Ukrainian treaty was impossible, the three powers started a new round of negotiations. A compromise was as the Austrians sought to balance the equation for their own gain; Ukraine would be military allied to Austria, but remain in Mitteleuropa. However, the economic part is much more complex, going through everything from foreign citizens' rights to conduct business in Ukraine on equal ground to the locals to clauses protecting foreign-owned factories and mines from being nationalised or harassed in other ways. The conditions are way milder than those that the Germans initially demanded."
ukrfor.109.a: "A return to stability, hopefully."
ukrfor.109.b: "Whatever."
ukrfor.109.c: "Wonderful!"

ukrfor.110.t: "The German-Ukrainian Treaty"
ukrfor.110.d: "After intense negotiations, the two powers reached a shaky agreement. The Ukrainian People's Republic will continue being militarily allied to Germany, and will host German troops in the country. However, the economic part is much more complex, going through everything from foreign citizens' rights to conduct business in Ukraine on equal ground to the locals to clauses protecting foreign-owned factories and mines from being nationalised or harassed in other ways. All this has kept the German industry's faith in Ukraine as a desirable location of investment but will no doubt become a troublesome thorn in the republic's side."
ukrfor.110.a: "A return to normalcy, hopefully."

ukrfor.111.t: "Fate of Skoropadskyi"
ukrfor.111.d: "The tables have turned. The former Hetman and his cronies escaped to Berlin before justice could catch them and are now organising the \"Ukrainian National Government\" in exile. They have petitioned the Kaiser to support them, though with poor results thus far. It's hard to believe that Skoropadskyi could be much of a threat to us anymore - but then again, he is guilty of countless crimes against the Ukrainian people and should face trial. We could request Germany to extradite him, though this might put the German government in an awkward position."
ukrfor.111.a: "Make the demand."
ukrfor.111.b: "His fate is no longer a concern of ours."

ukrfor.112.t: "Extradition Request of Pavlo Skoropadskyi"
ukrfor.112.d: "Pavlo Skoropadskyi, the former Ukrainian Hetman, has sought refuge in Berlin alongside what remains of his government. A new republican government sits in [202.GetName], and Skoropadskyi has been petitioning us to start military intervention to restore \"legal rule\" to Ukraine. It is entirely out of the question - the republican regime is willing to negotiate, and intervening at this point would mean open war with Ukraine, an event that the Russians would welcome with open arms.\n\nWe hoped to ignore Skoropadskyi entirely, but now the Ukrainian government has officially requested the extradition of the former Hetman to bring him to Ukraine to answer for his crimes. On the one hand, he is useless to us; extraditing him could be used as a token of goodwill towards Ukraine... but Skoropadskyi still has allies in Germany, and it would look embarrassing if a candidate we supported for two decades were tried as a war criminal."
ukrfor.112.a: "Send him to Ukraine."
ukrfor.112.b: "Refuse it."

ukrfor.113.t: "Germany Accepts the Extradition request"
ukrfor.113.d: "The German government has agreed, and Skoropadskyi has been arrested and accused of various high crimes. He will be sent to Ukraine shortly to stand for a trial and answer to the Ukrainian people for his deeds."
ukrfor.113.a: "Let us prepare the charges."

ukrfor.114.t: "Skoropadskyi Will Stay in Germany"
ukrfor.114.d: "In a polite answer from Berlin, they informed us that Pavlo Skoropadskyi has been granted asylum in Germany and as long as he has not committed crimes in Germany, he shall not be deported. In private, the German ambassador hinted that further prying on the matter would greatly displease Berlin, and recommended to let it be forgotten."
ukrfor.114.a: "The tyrant has escaped."

ukrfor.115.t: "Trial of the Hetman"
ukrfor.115.d: "The number of charges is enormous - ordering murders, torture, and imprisonment of peasants and workers of Ukraine from 1919, two decades of oppressive measures, and ordering mass executions during the Ukrainian Revolution of 1936. The well-prepared list of charges was politically motivated but genuine: blood was on the Hetman's hands. In Skoropadskyi's defence, he argued that everything he did was to protect the legal order of Ukraine and its democracy. In a surprisingly emotional speech, he assured that he has only ever had the welfare of all Ukrainians in his mind and that the charges - some of which he admits to being true and necessary - are a mere sham, as they were not illegal when they were committed, and have been unconstitutionally declared only after the fact.\n\nIn the end, he is still guilty - the only question is the punishment."
ukrfor.115.a: "He is a traitor and deserves to rot in prison."
ukrfor.115.b: "Show the poor man leniency he never showed to us."

ukrfor.116.t: "Ukraine Refused!"
ukrfor.116.d: "The new Ukrainian government has refused any further cooperation with us! They have stated that we should respect the will of the Ukrainian people and their sovereignity. Although this is just a fairy tale for Ukrainians, the empire cannot leave such impudence unanswered."
ukrfor.116.a: "Apply strictest sanctions!"

ukrfor.222.b: "Forget about it."

### Romania Claims ###
ukrfor.223.t: "Customs War With Romania"
ukrfor.223.d: "In 1918, both Romania and Ukraine claimed the territory of Bessarabia, which, for certain reasons, could not fully defend its causes. Both Romania and the Ukrainian Power denied Bessarabia the right to democratically and independently determine its future fate. Sfatul Cerii, the unrecognized government of the so-called Moldovan Democratic Republic, eventually, under the occupation of Bessarabia by the Romanian forces, attempted to become part of Romania, but this decision was not recognized by either Russia or Ukraine. Only the Minsk Treaty of 1920 between Germany and Russia, in which Ukraine also participated, set the official border with Romania along the Dniester River\n\nNevertheless, for many years the official position of the Ukrainian Power and the government of Skoropadskyi was that Bessarabia should become part of Ukraine on the rights of autonomy. In general, an understanding with Romania could not be found and, as a result, a customs war began, that is, economic sanctions, which led to the fact that for almost two decades, Romania and Ukraine have not had any trade relations.\n\nNow the situation is as follows. The Ukrainian government intends to send an ultimatum to Romania about the immediate withdrawal of troops from Bessarabia (or part of it) in exchange for the end of the trade war. If the Ukrainian goals of freeing the Ukrainians from the shackles of Romanianization can be achieved, this will undoubtedly be a victory for the Ukrainian national movement in Bessarabia."
ukrfor.223.a: "Demand all of Bessarabia!"
ukrfor.223.b: "Demand the coast and Khotyn province!"

ukrfor.224.t: "Ukraine Demands All of Bessarabia!"
ukrfor.224.d: "The Ukrainian government has once again renowned their claims on our lands. Despite the 20-year long trade war between our states, the Ukrainian government has now outright demanded our territories, promising to end the trade embargo if we give in."
ukrfor.224.a: "Give them what they want, we cannot fight now!"
ukrfor.224.b: "Are they kidding? Greater Romania shall never concede!"

ukrfor.225.t: "Ukraine Demands Part of Bessarabia!"

ukrfor.225.a: "$ukrfor.224.a$"
ukrfor.225.b: "$ukrfor.224.b$"

ukrfor.226.t: "[FROM.GetName] Betrayed Us!"
ukrfor.226.d: "In consequence of the [UKR.GetAdjective] ultimatum, the [FROM.GetAdjective] diplomats left us alone against this threat. What shall we do?"
ukrfor.226.a: "There is nothing we can do..."
ukrfor.226.b: "Resist to the invader!"

ukrfor.227.t: "[FROM.GetName] Attacks Us!"
ukrfor.227.d: "After being left alone against us, the Romanians decided to resist our annexation of their territory."
ukrfor.227.a: "We will crush them!"

ukrfor.228.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agrees!"
ukrfor.228.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to our ultimatum and has given up the land that they have occupied. In response, we promised to lift our trade sanctions on them."
ukrfor.228.a: "Finally, Ukrainians will be freed from Romanianization!"

ukrfor.229.t: "Our Ultimatum is Rejected!"
ukrfor.229.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused our terms and has denied any discussion of the Bessarabia question, as ever before. We must decide our next steps."
ukrfor.229.a: "Declare a liberation war!"
ukrfor.229.b: "Back down, but station our troops near the border."
ukrfor.229.c: "Completely back down!"

## Akt Zluki ##

ukrfor.230.t: "Velyka Zluka"
ukrfor.230.d: "Today, the Unification Act was signed between the governments of [WSU.GetNameDef] and [UKR.GetNameDef], as well as [WSU.GetLeader] and [UKR.GetLeader].\n\nOn the same day, speaking to an excited crowd in Kyiv, [UKR.GetLeader] declared that the Act of Unification was deeply determined historically and was based on the original dream of the Ukrainian people for an independent, united nation-state. It became a powerful manifestation of the will of Ukrainians for ethnic and territorial consolidation, evidence of their dynamic self-identification and the formation of the nation.\n\nThe Akt Zluki finally gave a complete form to the independent Ukrainian state and contributed to overcoming the rudiments of federalism in the mentality of the national political elite of the two countries. [UKR.GetLeader] also expressed the hope that the Unification would become a model of a civilized, democratic, non-exploitative assembly of territories in a single sovereign state."
ukrfor.230.a: "Slava Ukraini!"

## ROM-UKR Peace ##
ukrfor.231.t.victory: "Under the Gun"
ukrfor.231.d.victory: "The forces of the resurgent Ukrainian state have begun moving against us in earnest, seeking to rip Bessarabia from us, but much to their surprise, we have not only blunted their advance, but actually started to push them back! Perhaps now would be a good time to send a message asking them to come to the negotiating table. The embarrassment they just received should be enough to at least get them to hear us out."
ukrfor.231.t.defeat: "The Ukrainians Are Beaten!"
ukrfor.231.d.defeat: "The forces of the resurgent Ukrainian state have begun moving against us in earnest, seeking to reconquer Bessarabia; and as valiant as our efforts may be, ultimately it was in vain. Our forces put up a good fight but were pushed aside, and now the country is holding its breath in anticipation of the hardships of a Ukrainian invasion. There may be hope however, if we sue for peace and cede their claims, we might save our country."
ukrfor.231.a: "We have no choice; send word to Kyiv."
ukrfor.231.b: "We can still win this!"
ukrfor.231.c: "We prevail!"
ukrfor.231.d: "No, they must be taught a lesson."

ukrfor.232.t.victory: "The Romanians Cower Before Us!"
ukrfor.232.d.victory: "Our campaign to secure Bessarabia has been successful, and the Romanians, dreading further damage to their country have asked us to begin negotiations in order to end this war. How should we respond?"
ukrfor.232.t.defeat: "The Romanians Hold!"
ukrfor.232.d.defeat: "Disaster! Our attempt to march into Bessarabia and reclaim that which is ours has been met with far more resistance than we originally envisioned! Not only have the Romanians held off the brunt of the initial assault, but they have also managed to repel us for quite some time by now! If this embarrassment continues, our military machine will become the laughingstock of the world! Our foreign ministry recommends we accept their terms, although this may not be seen in the best light by our people..."
ukrfor.232.a: "Accept; no point in wasting any more Ukrainian lives."
ukrfor.232.b: "Refuse; they must be taught a lesson!"
ukrfor.232.c: "Reach out to the Romanians; this humiliation must end."
ukrfor.232.d: "To hell with them! We will liberate Bessarabia at all costs!"

ukrfor.233.t: "The Ukrainians Accept"
ukrfor.233.d.victory: "With their recent humiliation, the Ukrainian government has reluctantly agreed to renounce their claims on Bessarabia, in exchange for an immediate cession of hostilities and Romanian troops' withdrawal to their side of the border. The storm has come; and we have successfully weathered it."
ukrfor.233.d.defeat: "While we have successfully managed to convince the Ukrainians to agree to an immediate cession of hostilities and withdrawal of troops, the Ukrainians have not budged on the Bessarabia issue; it is to be ceded to Ukrainian control, as envisioned in 1918. Fortunately we have managed to preserve the rest of our country any further humiliation, and one day we may have an opportunity to reunite with our brethren again..."
ukrfor.233.a: "United just to be torn asunder again..."
ukrfor.233.b: "1812 has been avenged at last!"

ukrfor.234.t: "Ukraine Refuses Peace"
ukrfor.234.d: "Shocking news from Kyiv have arrived recently, as the Ukrainians have refused to begin peace negotiations! They claim that the injuries against the Ukrainian nation are too great to overcome, and that the war will not end until Ukrainian troops are marching through Bucharest. We must see to our defences..."
ukrfor.234.a: "God have mercy."
ukrfor.234.b: "If it's a fight they want..."


## Ukrainian Civil War Petliura ##
ukrfor.252.t: "Chaos In Ukraine"
ukrfor.252.d: "Ukraine has been turbulent of late. The political crisis that erupted after the September events led to a large-scale outbreak of anti-monarchist forces that succeeded in overthrowing the government and announcing the return of the Ukrainian People's Republic. However, the socialist government was unable to effectively organize the new government, as a result of which Otaman Symon Petliura, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, seized power in the country.\n\nBut this was not the end of the series of misfortunes. The peasants and workers in the South and Southeast, led by radical leftists, revolted against Othoman. That would be all right, but Ukraine is an important region that provides food and labor for all of Europe.\n\nWhoever owns Ukraine owns all of Eastern Europe. "

However, he is mistaken in thinking that Ukraine will surrender Kyiv to the German forces. \n\nOtaman Petliura ordered all combat-ready units to immediately rush to defend the borders of our republic. However, this decision could be dangerous, since the Borotbysts hold power in the south. It may be worth offering them a temporary alliance to save Ukraine, otherwise the Ukrainian people will once again find themselves in slavery and on the verge of physical annihilation."
ukrfor.253.d.RUS: "Taking advantage of our weakness and blatantly violating the Minsk Peace, Russian army troops treacherously attacked Ukraine! Justifying their aggression by protection of the Russian-speaking population, they only bring the world closer to a new world war and chaos. We will not surrender Ukraine to them and we must fight them back vigorously."
ukrfor.253.d.POL: "The Poles have long been greedy for our land. Appealing to the borders of the Rzeczpospolita, the long-time dream of Polish nationalists was to regain control of the land of Right-Bank Ukraine. Now we must repel Poland's treacherous attack in order to retain our territories."
ukrfor.253.d.WHR: "The traitorous position of Belarus on the solution of territorial conflicts by force will bring them down! Yesterday, the government of Belarus, under the aegis of protecting the Belarussian population, treacherously attacked our northern borders. Their aggression will not go unchecked and sooner or later we will get our legitimate territories back!"
ukrfor.253.d.ROM: "The Romanian government launched a large-scale attack on our territory without a declaration of war. Practically in a few hours they captured major population centers and reached the Dniester River, including the capture of Odesa. These territories have never belonged to Romania and the position of Ukraine on this issue remains unchanged. Romanians will pay for their betrayal."

ukrfor.260.d: "Amidst all-out aggression and an attempt to divide Ukraine, the counter-revolutionary government of Otaman Petliura asked us to conclude a temporary truce and alliance against the enemies of Ukraine.

While the influence of the newly-established parties is too low for now to be relevant, they are already gaining some attention in the media.\nThe Socialist Party of Intermarium has been established from the majority of the left-leaning and socialist organisations, promoting unification sentiments and is getting ready to promote planned economy in our alliance. The Social-Democratic Party of Intermarium was also formed and is seemingly very powerful and organised, due to the common history of the Social-Democratic parties in the former Russian Empire lands.\nFinally, even those who oppose the concept of Mizhmoria have united into so-called Union of Conservatives.\nFinally, our leading party, the ULD has also announced its supraparty organisation - The Intermarium Liberal-Democrats."

Both conservatives and socialists currently oppose the Bill and have suggested their amendements, but we have to choose the side this time.\n\nWhile the Conservatives consider that the Bill is too 'syndicalist', the Socialists believe it to be too 'Reactionary'. Therefore, the KSM has suggested to restrict taxation on farmers and any cooperatives between the independent smallholders.

mizhmoria.79.t: "SPM Opposes the Bill!"

mizhmoria.80.t: "KSM Opposes the Bill!"

mizhmoria.81.d: "This bill would aim to establish a central bank of the single Intermarium currency area and an independent Intermarium institution, which will conduct monetary policy.

It is meant to prevent diseases and threats to health, as well as to promote research and define compulsory health policies. This approach is not shared by the LDPM and KSM. Instead, they suggest that the health policies should not be defined, nor the organisation and provision of health services and medical care. Instead, the policy should serve to complement national policies and to support cooperation between member countries in the field of public health."

UKR_Coalition_With_UVO_desc: "The Ukrainian Military Organisation grew very powerful in the last decade, mostly due to the fact that it united many of Ukrainian officers, who fought in the Independence War against Bolsheviks.

UKR_OUN_Nationalists_desc: "A number of Polish landlords control land in Western and Central Ukraine for historical reasons. Since Poland is decidedly weak now, we can easily confiscate their estates, expel these Poles, and redistribute their lands among the Ukrainian peasants.

UKR_Coalition_Wih_UDP_desc: "Mykola Mikhnovskyi, one of the creators of Ukrainian Conservatism, along with Lypynskyi and Skoropadskyi, is known to be an eccentric man and a visionary. In fact, he is not an actual leader of any political force. He was exiled by Hetman a few years ago to Kuban, where he teaches in university, away from political life of Ukraine. Nevertheless, now without any more possible allies, perhaps it is high time for Hetman to turn to Mikhnovskyi and offer him a seat in the government."

UKR_Concessions_To_The_National_Democrats_desc: "Despite we cannot fully trust Mikhnovskyi, we must ensure that his movement has strong foundation. We should give some of the Mikhnovite politicians official seats in our system, perhaps, as local Starostas of the governorates."

UKR_Palm_Of_MC_desc: "Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, a Cossack enthusiast and Hetman's chancellery general clerk is the main proponent of the Hetmanate traditions. Being supporter of Vilne Kozatstvo movement he did much to revive the traditions of the past, but Hetman always prefered a different approach. However, now the 'Gentleman Usher' of the Pan Hetman's court became his right hand and the Otoman-Minister and changes await the Ukrainian State."
UKR_Legacy_Of_First_Hetmanate: "Legacy of the First Hetmanate"
UKR_Legacy_Of_First_Hetmanate_desc: "The term of the First Hetmanate appeared soon after Skoropadskyi was proclaimed the Hetman in 1918, turning Ukraine into the 'Second Hetmanate'. The First Hetmanate, existing in 1649-1764, was established during Khmelnystkyi’s Uprising, effectively becoming a Russian protectorate and vassal state later to be disbanded and directly annexed into the Empire. The first truly national Ukrainian state was a great success of the Ukrainian national movement and its traditions should be revived and its legacy honored."
UKR_Cossack_Class: "Magnify the Cossack Class"
UKR_Cossack_Class_desc: "The Cossack Class in Ukraine was destroyed by the treacherous actions of the Russian Tsars, but with the revival of the Ukrainian State it has been restored.

UKR_Convene_General_Rada_desc: "The game of democracy or authoritarianism, initiated by the German's will have become too dangerous for our Cossack State. Instead of Soim, the General Rada should be established - a special legislative institution, headed by Hetman (if not elected), Cossacks, Orthodox Church representatives and representatives of the Cities. This will allow us to concentrate power not only in the hands of military men, but also share it with the civilians to a certain degree."

UKR_Urban_Autonomy_desc: "Since ancient times such cities as Kyiv, Chernihiv, Starodub, Poltava and the others had Magdeburg Rights which allowed them to develop and be independent from Feudals. We should continue this centuries-long legacy that allowed our cities to prosper. The younger cities, especially in the Southern and South-Eastern Ukraine should be granted greater urban autonomies."
UKR_Military_Administration: "Adopt the Cossack Administrative Division"
UKR_Military_Administration_desc: "The Hetmanate's administrative division was based on regiments that were dislocated within it and it proved to be a succesful means of managing the territories.

UKR_Expand_Membership_Of_The_Union_desc: "We should not find allies among our past friends - we must give up any idea to reconcile with those who opposed us.

With the establishment of Free Ukraine, the activities of Prosvita blossomed, however, very soon they became very much politically loaded, as the leadership of Prosvita became highly associated with the Dyrektoria.

According to the theory, the guarantor of such a regime is the legally-limited constitutional monarchy. The Social Class for Lypynskyi is just a foundation for the state-building.

As their Dictatorship of the Proletariat now rises from the ashes of the old order, Bosh and her crimson clique work to cement themselves as the new vanguard of the Ukranian Revolution while they draft their designs for a new Ukraine entirely transformed by Communism. However, Bosh’s position as one of the world’s first female heads of state is tenuous at best as her failing health begins to catch up with her while new forces vie for dominance from within Kyiv’s peasantry..."

UKR_A_Centralised_Government_desc: "The first step our new Bolshevik-inspired government must take in order to secure the Revolution is to centralize political power and the wider apparatus of state and governance within the hands of Bosh and the other leading members of the Communist Party of Ukraine. Only then can the proletariat be truly freed, and only then can the Revolution truly be secure from threats both foreign and domestic. From atop this consolidated and centralized Dictatorship of the Proletariat, Bosh and the KP(b)U will rule with the entire nation without resistance or obstacles, rendering the state and its future to be nothing but a plaything to be molded to Socialist perfection in the palms of their hands."

Long gone are the glowing days of the Baugy Group and her time as a self-supporting young mother and intellectual revolutionary naive to the harsh future, instead replaced by days of endless struggle as she endeavored to transform Ukraine into a Communist utopia supported by Mother Russia. Her body and soul finally giving out, Bosh leaves the fate of the Revolution in more eager and hungry hands as the rest of the KP(b)U fall into the violent vacuum of power created in her wake, though one figure has begun to rise to the top of the Party hierarchy above all others..."

Dodging claims that he was secretly behind Bosh’s premature death and sidestepping vitriol hurled at him by the Russophobic masses, Khruschev now leads the highly centralized Dictatorship of the Proletariat organized by his predecessor, leaving him free to choose the direction of the Revolution and the fate of the nation and its people as he ponders on the future of Ukraine at the great crossroads of our political evolution."

UKR_Invite_Ukapists_Khrusch: "Unity with the Ukapists"
UKR_Invite_Ukapists_Khrusch_desc: "The Ukrainian Communist Party - more commonly called the Ukapists - have traditionally been our rivals on the Left, for the Ukapists have frequently battled with our own KP(b)U throughout the past, mostly due to our Party’s former anti-Ukrainian slant under Bosh. However, with Chairman Khruschov now at the helm actively eroding away our former Russophilic tendencies in favor of Ukrainian unity, we have begun to approach our old rivals with open arms instead of clenched fists. Together, the two truly Marxist parties of Ukraine - the Ukapists and the Bolsheviks - shall work in unison in order to create a brighter future for our people and a more secure Revolution."

A lifetime political activist, author, artist, statesman, and a Founding Father of Ukraine, Vynnychenko served as the first and third Prime Minister of the Ukrainian People’s Republic in 1917 as a member of the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party, and has forever since stood as a titan of Ukrainian nationalism and Leftism.

The icy, violent Winter of violent reaction and radicalism shall finally come to an end as the KP(b)U embraces its Ukrainian homeland and identity with new gusto. The harshest and most outwardly violent or distasteful policies on both the domestic and international stages shall be rescinded, de-radicalized, or reformed as Khruschov paints our regime in a new, more inviting and seemingly friendlier light in order to attract more allies and create more opportunities for our Revolution to not only survive, but to blossom and prosper in this new Spring.

By working with the various cadres, soviets, and other Communist groups from Mother Russia, we shall be able to bolster the Ukrainian Revolution. We shall flood these lands with Russian-Bolshevik militants, revolutionaries, agitators, firebrands, and more, organizing them into new units and utilizing them as a free and secretive arm of the Party so that we may secure the Revolution and Khrushchev’s wider dream for this wretched land."

UKR_No_National_Question_in_my_realm_desc: "The ‘national question’ of Ukrainian statehood and the wider dubious claim that the Ukrainian identity is distinct from the Russian whole, and as such must be sovereign, are nothing but pseudoscientific and ahistorical hogwash created by the elitist bourgeois in Kyiv in order to carve out their own vile fiefdom of capital and reaction free from the Russian truth and the interests of the true Slavic masses. Even denying Luxemburg’s own ideas of the National Question as a political concept along with ideas of autonomy and self-determination, the KP(b)U under Chairman Khrushchev will not stand for any notions of ‘Ukrainization’ in the slightest. Ukraine is Russia, and Russia is Ukraine, and it is high time that every wayward and misinformed soul in this godforsaken land learn this hard truth immediately and without compromise, delay, or mercy for those that resist."

Naturally, we shall institute quotas and other additional failsafes in order to push the proletariat to finish these plans earlier, allowing us to plan the next one more quickly while also proving to the world that Ukraine is a modern and industrial superpower that should not be trifled with."
UKR_Mass_Nationalization_Khrusch: "Mass Nationalization"
UKR_Mass_Nationalization_Khrusch_desc: "In accordance with the Seven-Year Plan, all of Ukrainian society - from the smallest landholding to the largest monopoly - is to be nationalized.

And next to them, workers’ towns and proletarian communities are being built so that our laborers have a place to live nearby. Operating in accordance with the Semiletka, this process of large-scale industrialization and mechanization of society shall continue as planned until Ukraine stands toe to toe with the other industrial giants of the world on equal footing."
UKR_Sprawling_Cities: "Sprawling Cities"
UKR_Sprawling_Cities_desc: "From the hustle and bustle of Kyiv and Kharkiv to the quiet farming villages along the lower Dnieper, the heartland of Ukraine’s population centers have begun to embrace the idea of mass urbanization as the cities of Ukraine slowly turn into concrete jungles and steel metropolises. Though we shall always have a rural population, largely dedicated to our agricultural pursuits, we must have a dense, sprawling, and profitable urban expanse if we are to compete with the other growing superpowers."

UKR_Industrial_Smoke_desc: "As smoke stacks billow and the smog of industrial progress oozes out of our factories like a great, dark miasma of modern prosperity, the skies and the lungs of the proletariat may darken, but our future shines brighter and more clearly than ever! Industrial smoke is merely the sign of an advanced and prosperous society living at the cutting-edge of mechanized science and industrialized society. Surely it is nothing to be worried about, for our Revolution only bears fruits of plenty and progress, not reaction or demise."
UKR_Start_Collectivization: "Start Collectivisation"
UKR_Start_Collectivization_desc: "The bourgeois that once ran the former, failed Ukrainian governments made serious mistakes and missteps in the past while chasing the opiate-like allure of profit, turning Ukraine into a hotbed for Kulaks, land owners, and lecherous agriculturists over decades of mismanagement and reactionary-fueled idiocy. Mass and immediate efforts of collectivisation is the only answer to this grave injustice. New communes and collectives shall rise across Ukraine by diktat of the Party in order to remedy this sickly existence until all agriculture in Ukraine is free from the predatory nature of failed capitalism."

UKR_Cornification: "CORNIFICATION"
UKR_Cornification_desc: "By no doubt, if there is a vegetable that can grow anywhere it is surely the wonderplant known as corn - and after Khrushchev’s recent visit to America, there is no doubt it should grow and be cultivated to become the centerpiece of Europe’s Breadbasket back here at home. Pivoting his focus and the priorities of the Party drastically, the ‘Corn Lord’ as he is now known [ROOT.GetLeader] shall create a new system of Communist industry based entirely around the cultivation and application of corn and corn-based technologies, all for the greater good of Ukraine and the Revolution."
UKR_Corn_Based_Products: "Corn-Based Products"
UKR_Corn_Based_Products_desc: "Seeking to utilize every aspect and part of the corn plant in some form or another to aid the state, the Party under [ROOT.GetLeader] has begun funding a research and development division entirely based around the goal of finding every possible use for the plant and crop there is. Though many scoff at this idea, we know the true genius behind this move, for building a self-sufficient system can be really easy and affordable when you utilize the same easy-to-grow high-yield crop for every product."
UKR_Feed_Cattle_With_Corn: "Feed Cattle With Corn"
UKR_Feed_Cattle_With_Corn_desc: "Recent scientific studies conducted both in the Americas and back here in our own labs show that cattle and other livestock like sheep fed with corn live healthier lives and yield more produce, like meat and milk, with higher nutritional value, or can yield greater amounts of higher-quality material like wools and leathers. With this knowledge in mind, we shall begin to feed all livestock in Ukraine on a diet based largely around corn with other minor supplements to fill in the nutritional gaps, lowering running-costs for our farmers and agricultural workers while increasing yield across the board."
UKR_Corn_Silk: "Corn Silk Clothes"
UKR_Corn_Silk_desc: "By utilizing the long silk-like fibers that grow out of ears of corn and within the stalks and husks of the crop, we have been able to create a new domestic textile industry to supplement and even eventually replace more expensive rival industries like cotton. Called ‘corn silk’, the fibers have long been known to hold health benefits as an herbal remedy, brewed into teas and extracts or even smoked or plain ingested for the medicinal effects, but now they have a far more widespread and beneficial use as a cheap, replenishable, abundant, and comfortable textile to be used in all facets of Ukrainian society, from the creation of our vyshyvanka and other clothing to more industrial applications."
UKR_Conoplya_Plantations: "Konoplia Plantations"
UKR_Conoplya_Plantations_desc: "While some believe that Konoplia, called Hemp in the West, is a threat to national health, we believe that we can use this wonderful plant as a raw material in a variety of industries in order to supplement corn production. From use as a fuel, a textile, a source of clean-burning lamp oil, a source of cheap, strong paper and resistant construction materials, and even as a recreational and medicinal drug in some cases when specific types of hemp called cannabis is used, along with a million other uses, these new konoplia plantations shall help create a stress-free and self-sufficient Ukraine guided by Communist genius."
UKR_Industrial_Farming: "Industrial Farming"
UKR_Industrial_Farming_desc: "It is not enough to just simply move some dirt and plant some seeds, for modern farming requires modern solutions if we are to successfully and reliably feed a nation of millions. Our agricultural industry must become as industrialized and as mechanized as our other lynchpin industries, for our corn-based industry is as important as any other facet of our economy, and if one facet begins to lag behind, the entire system and wider Revolution will lag along with it. As such, we will modernize our agrarian pursuits without restraint so that the cornbasket of Europe can truly begin to blossom."
UKR_Corn_Infrastracture: "Corn Infrastructure"
UKR_Corn_Infrastracture_desc: "As our new cornfields continue to grow and sprawl out far past the outskirts of any centralized population center, Ukraine risks becoming an unconnected island of farmsteads and cities lost among the amber waves of grain unless we do something to stop it. As such, new infrastructure intiratives shall be started across the nation, building new roads and bridges and tunnels with our corn industry in mind above all other worries. We will unite the disparate corn farms and collectives across Ukraine into an interconnected corn superhighway that works in perfect harmony and synchrony with each other, fueling the Revolution to new heights atop perfectly greased wheels and newly paved asphalt."

UKR_Great_Irrigational_Projects: "Great Irrigational Projects"
UKR_Great_Irrigational_Projects_desc: "To grow a lot of corn, one first needs a lot of water, and in the marshy depths of rural Ukraine, irrigation and clean, reliable water has never been needed more. We shall create a new earthenworks division that shall be specifically tasked with modernizing and expanding the irrigational networks of every farmstead and collective in Ukraine, allowing us to provide water for thousands of Kolkhozes and all the corn they could possibly grow."
UKR_New_Farming_Communes: "Introduction of 'Kukuruza Kolkhoz'"
UKR_New_Farming_Communes_desc: "Until our political ascendance, the Kolkhoz - or a traditional collective farm run by Ukrainian peasants from long before the rise of Communism - was just the most efficient way of organizing agricultural work in Ukraine. However, thanks to the brilliant innovations designed by our Great Kormchyi [ROOT.GetLeader], a new form of collective farm shall rise. Called the Kukuruza Kolkhoz, these evolved communes are self-sufficient, collectivized agricultural communities entirely dedicated to the cultivation of corn and its related produce, such as corn silk. Beloved by [ROOT.GetLeader] himself as his own creative brainchild, the Kukuruza Kolkhoz plan has been presented to modernist and Leftist exhibitions across Europe as a stunning example of Bolshevik realism at work as they are steadily erected and organized across Ukraine, greatly increasing our efficiency when it comes to growing corn."

However, with as many allies as he has, our Chairman has many more enemies who wish to snake their way into the hearts and minds of the gullible masses in an attempt to turn the proletariat against their savior. This cannot be allowed to happen! The masses must know who they can thank for their salvation, for they will surely never turn back on the man that brought them utopia. A personality cult shall be constructed around the Great Kormchyi in order to solidify his image with the state and the Party itself, for [ROOT.GetLeader] is Ukraine, and Ukraine is [ROOT.GetLeader]."

UKR_Khrushchyovka_desc: "'Khrushchyovka' is the unofficial designation for a new type of low-cost, concrete-paneled three to five-storied apartment building developed at the request of our leader [ROOT.GetLeader]. Mass production of these tenement structures should finally solve the housing problem that has begun to balloon in the rapidly expanding urban centers being built at the behest of the regime, while their construction should provide an influx of new jobs that shall help with the unemployment crisis as well. Killing two birds with one stone, these garrish concrete structures, usually painted in wild colors to hide their drab nature, shall provide jobs and housing all in one for those that need it."

UKR_For_Every_Houes_A_Bloc_Car_desc: "With new automobile plants opening across Ukraine like the central plant in the Zaporizhia region, our citizens can now afford the brand new Zaporozhets - an affordable, ‘reliable’ automobile designed for the proletarian masses. Unfortunately, they won’t buy it, as sales figures show that these jalopies are far from popular with the public. To solve this issue, we shall bypass the market entirely by providing a Zaporozhets car for every bloc house! This shall grant each Khrushchyovka a shared automobile to be used by the tennents, bringing the fancy thrills, status, and usefulness of car-ownership to the masses."

UKR_State_Socialist_Mysticism_desc: "The Great Kormchyi has initiated a slew of grandiose state programs that aim to inject more ‘esoteric’ ideas and concepts into Ukraine’s national culture, art, science, and even political philosophy. Drawing on ideas from Russian circles on Cosmism, Spiritualism, Spiritism, Mysticism, and wider Occultism, our beloved Helmsman will force the proletariat to embrace epigenesis - or spiritual evolution - in order to embrace every aspect of Communism, both physical and ephemeral. Together, we shall seek to breed a nation of well-rounded and harmoniously-developed individuals who are all devoted to spiritual self-perfection, and who will all ultimately ‘work, live and create according to the laws of beauty.’"

UKR_Pig_Production_desc: "Pork, and other produce of pigs or swine, has always been a popular delicacy here in Ukraine, with pork and salo featuring in many local dishes while other, less-edible parts of the animal are used in a variety of industries and applications. Famous for consuming anything, we shall grow our swineherds plentiful and fat on the natural bounty of corn, ensuring no waste in our agricultural system as pigs eat the parts of the corn we cannot use, or the excess corn we cannot process, while providing great bounty and succulent taste in return."
UKR_Naukograds: "Build the Naukograds"
UKR_Naukograds_desc: "Also called Technopoles, the Naukograds - literally translating to ‘science cities’ - shall rise across Ukraine to serve as new centralized centers for our academia to flourish in. Urban centers and small towns filled with high concentrations of research and development facilities, universities, laboratories, and more, these Naukograds shall become the interconnected heart of Ukrainian science and technology, dragging this once-backwards land into the glorious wonders of a scientific future."

UKR_Breed_Corn_Variety_desc: "Taking a note from our agricultural allies in the Americas, [ROOT.GetLeader] has pushed for our eggheads and agricultural scientists to develop and breed new forms of corn that will better serve the Party. From tastier, juicer, and bigger corn meant for human consumption to hairier corn cultivated for their corn silk or drought-resistant corn to survive the harsh Ukrainian Winters, we shall grow as many new types of corn that we need, for [ROOT.GetLeader] teaches us that corn is Communism, and Communism is corn."

This is not only symbolic to the strength of our country, but shall also act as a threat towards the imperialists who watch on like circling predators!

We shall bury these doubting fools, for [ROOT.GetLeader] swears that we will not only catch up to these foreign economies and powers, but we shall exceed them until Ukraine is the greatest superpower on Earth.

### Economy Focuses ###
UKR_Agricultural_Crisis: "Agricultural Crisis Reaction"
UKR_Agricultural_Crisis_desc: "The agricultural crisis has almost shattered the Ukrainian economy and stability in the country. The King barely controls the country, those loyal to the Hetman peasants want land reforms, pro-Russian forces and Nationalists demand radical measures and the Socialists mobilise their supporters all over the country..."
UKR_Stabilize_Hryvnia: "Stabilize the Hryvnia"
UKR_Stabilize_Hryvnia_desc: "For the first time, hryvnia was released into circulation on October 17, 1918. Initially, the hryvnia was supposed to play the role of domestic loan bonds. However, the shortage of banknotes in circulation led to the fact that both bonds and individual coupons began to be used as money at the beginning of 1919. During this time, the economy has stabilized and many of the efforts of former Finance Minister Anton Rzhepetskyi to stabilize the national Ukrainian currency have been justified. However, due to Black Monday, the situation has worsened. Urgent measures must be taken to stabilize the Hryvnia!"
UKR_deposit_protection_law: "Empower Derzhavnyi Bank"
UKR_deposit_protection_law_desc: "By 1936, a wide network of credit and banking institutions with a multi-level structure was created in the country, which covered all branches of the agrarian-industrial economy of the region. It ensured the normal movement of goods, money and credit resources, although its power was significantly inferior to similar systems of industrial and industrial-agrarian countries of Western Europe. However, now our system needs additional support from the state. By giving extra powers to the Derzhavnyi (State) Bank, we can make sure it can bail out failing commercial banks."
UKR_State_Sponsored_Construction_Works: "State-Sponsored Construction Works"
UKR_State_Sponsored_Construction_Works_desc: "To industrialize the country and do so fast, the state needs to direct money and resources towards construction projects which are critical to the economy of the state and so need to be finished quickly. Let us create a system of these works and help the Ukrainian economy grow."
UKR_Rural_Credit_Banks: "Rural Credit Banks"
UKR_Rural_Credit_Banks_desc: "With the agricultural crisis raging, credit is not a popular thing in the rural areas. The State Land Bank refused to give credits directly to the farms, being on the edge of default. We should establish rural banking systems, created to give poor peasants access to much-needed financial support and credit."
UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery: "Begin Ukrainian Recovery"
UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery_desc: "Social problems always provoke political instability. Lots of peasants join Socialist, nationalist or Russian separatist movements because of awful living conditions. If we want to save Ukraine from collapse, we should start a recovery programme and help the poorest grain-growers in Central Ukraine, providing our population with the cheap electricity they require. For this, we need cash."

 ### Army ### (Changed into Skoropadskyi's Army, Nationalist Army, Republican Army and Socialist Army)
 UKR_ostwall_focus: "The Ostwall Programme"
 UKR_ostwall_focus_desc: "Originally envisioned by the Baltische Landswehr in the late 1920s, \"The East Wall\" is a comprehensive system of fortifications on the front line nations of the Reichspakt. Ukraine is too large and has too many salients to support a single continuous line of fortifications, but some of our own officers began formulating plans for a modified Ostwall, plans in which the cadets have taken immense interest."
 UKR_army_internal_structure_review: "The Army Internal Structure Review"
 UKR_army_internal_structure_review_desc: "As 1936 rolls around, Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, on behalf of King Vasyl, sets out to conduct his yearly review of the Army’s Internal Structure. A personal project of the Hetman, Skoropadskyi has dedicated much of time and resources to grooming the developing Military Apparatus."
 UKR_fate_of_freikorps: "Fate of Ukrainisches Freikorps"
 UKR_fate_of_freikorps_desc: "Established in 1919, the Ukrainian Freikorps helped the Hetman to provide his army with German volunteers in exchange for land. For some, however, this becomes a real problem. We should decide what to do with Freikorps and possibly disband it."
 
 UKR_army_research_bureau: "Establish the Army Research Bureau"
 UKR_army_research_bureau_desc: "As we march into the future, it becomes plainly obvious that new wars will rather be won using superior technology than any long-form trench warfare or “flood-wave” tactics. As such, we should establish an Army department tasked with staying on top of any new developments in Doctrinal or Technological enhancements."
 UKR_armament_program: "Reserve Armament Programme"
 UKR_armament_program_desc: "Our reserve manpower is easily over a million men - but the harsh truth is that we barely have equipment to arm half that many in case of mobilisation. It must be solved quickly."
 UKR_state_arsenals: "Inspectorate of the Arsenals"
 UKR_state_arsenals_desc: "The Ukrainian arms industry is spread across the country with no overall coordinating body to direct research and production. Appointing a military body to oversee them would ensure efficiency."
 
 UKR_centralise_military_railway_service: "Centralise the Military Railway Service"
 UKR_centralise_military_railway_service_desc: "A unified logistical structure is the lifeblood of any army defending a country as large as Ukraine. All trains used by the army will be organised by single department under the headquarters of the army, instead of the current regional organisation."
 UKR_adopt_modern_radio_technology: "Implement Army Radio Service"
 UKR_adopt_modern_radio_technology_desc: "The Army Radio Service can easily be considered one of the pillars of future warfare. Yet, the service still lacks a proper centralized structure to make its use effective. Let us implement a centralized scheme."
  
 UKR_refurbish_odessa_military_academy: "Refurbish Odesa Military Academy"
 UKR_refurbish_odessa_military_academy_desc: "As one of the oldest Military Academies in the former Russian Empire, the Odesa Military Academy is a prime education source for the arts of war. Nevertheless, the Academy has never gotten proper oversight since our Independence. Time to change that."
 
 
 UKR_reform_committee: "Army Reform Committee"
 UKR_reform_committee_desc: "The old army of the Hetman was corrupt and inefficient. Instead of a military dictator, the commander-in-chief will be the government-appointed Supreme Otaman and his regional representatives. In this way, army leadership is in the hands of professional soldiers, yet under civilian control, as it should be in any modern state."
 UKR_curtail_army_factionalism: "Curtail Army Factionalism"
 UKR_curtail_army_factionalism_desc: "There has been animosity between army's former Russian generals and younger, more Ukrainian nationalist-minded men. Sometimes this mistrust has even affected the army promotions in a negative way. All this factionalism needs to go. Promotions must be decided by a neutral committee appointed by the [UKR_leader_title], and all kind of nepotism must be crushed."
 UKR_Expand_National_Guard: "Expand the National Guard"
 UKR_Expand_National_Guard_desc: "The Natsionalna Hvardiia, established first as the His Serene Highness Hetman's loyal troops, in order to defend him from any trouble, should be expanded and united with Derzhavna Varta into a single defensive force that should deal with resistance and guard our country from any enemies."
  
 UKR_doctrinal_experimentation: "Doctrinal Experimentation"
 UKR_doctrinal_experimentation_desc: "Emboldened by the rise in global tensions, the Hetman has appealed for solidification of a proper course for the army, based on newly developed warfare doctrines. For such a task, he has turned to the Top Officers’ Corps, composed of high Officers of the Independence Era - Oleksandr Udovychenko and Oleksandr Zahrodskyi."
 UKR_rapid_mobility_drills: "Rapid Mobility Drills"
 UKR_rapid_mobility_drills_desc: "High Armored Mobility is key in modern warfare. Which is why we should make sure we have an ample supply of armored mechanical vehicles that we know how to properly utilize."
 UKR_Tractors_to_Tanks: "From Tractors to Tanks"
 UKR_Tractors_to_Tanks_desc: "Agricultural mechanisation has created Ukraine’s most prominent industry: Agricultural tractors. With the growth of our automotive and agricultural machinery industry, it is possible to convert civilian production into military vehicles, including tanks."
 UKR_tank_corps: "Ukrainian Armoured Corps"
 UKR_tank_corps_desc: "With German-built tanks, we can organise our first proper armoured division as the core for future expansion. A quick armoured force will form our fist in the plains of Ukraine."
 
 UKR_lessons_of_the_weltkrieg: "Lessons of the Weltkrieg"
 UKR_lessons_of_the_weltkrieg_desc: "Emboldened by the rise in global tensions, the Hetman has appealed for solidification of a proper course for the army, based on experiences of the Weltkrieg. For such a task, he has turned to the High Officers’ Corps, composed of top Officers of the Former Russian Imperial Army - Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko, Oleksandr Hrekiv and Kostiantyn Prisovskyi."
 UKR_expand_kyiv_officer_school: "Expand the Kyiv Officer School"
 UKR_expand_kyiv_officer_school_desc: "The Kyiv Officer Instruction School was established in 1918, during the first year of Hetman Skoropadskyi’s rule (but before the coronation of King Vasyl) and since then has been a consistent source of newfangled officer graduates. We should take steps to expand it."
 UKR_consolidate_the_reserve_forces: "Consolidate the Reserve Forces"
 UKR_consolidate_the_reserve_forces_desc: "Currently, our reserve forces are spread out across various departments as a consequence of the bureaucratic disease. We should take steps to rectify this misdirection and unify the reservists across a streamlined number of detachments."
 UKR_implement_48_hour_plan: "Implement the 48-Hour Plan"
 UKR_implement_48_hour_plan_desc: "Informally known as the “48-Hour Plan”, this plan exists as a contingency effort to make sure we can defend ourselves from a total onslaught in the event of a massive invasion (most likely from the East). Successful implementation would allow us to enact a total mobilisation in the nation and make sure the foreign invaders are stopped."

 UKR_mobile_infantry: "Rapid Infantry Doctrine"
 UKR_mobile_infantry_desc: "The doctrine adapted widely in the Oststaat in the 1920s has been that of manoeuvre, as German instructors have brought their proven ways of war to our training. Our method cannot rely as much on armour and air force as the German one does, but we compensate for the lack of heavy equipment with large numbers of mounted and motorised units, who can move rapidly and use their localised numerical superiority to break enemy strongpoints."
 
 UKR_hetman_army: "Landeswehr Inspiration"
 UKR_hetman_army_desc: "The Baltic Landeswehr always was a source of inspiration for the Hetman. A professional, regular army of Baltic Germans, that, despite their minority, were able to organzie themselves into a true army. Despite our country is much bigger and much more populated, we should stick to our principles of regular and professional army. Only this will ensure our abilities to defend ourselves."
 UKR_integration_of_cossacks: "Integration of the Cossack Councils"
 UKR_integration_of_cossacks_desc: "Modern Cossack organisation was founded to promote the martial virtues, but their connection to the professional military has been strenuous. Ideally, they should become part of the reserve proper, and trained and equipped to be easily integrated into professional units in the time of war."
 UKR_interservice_cooperation: "Interservice Cooperation"
 UKR_interservice_cooperation_desc: "Instead of infantryman, or artilleryman, or sailors, they are all knights of Ukraine. Rivalry between branches must end, and a common spirit needs to be created to foster mentality of cooperation between different arms."
 UKR_primacy_of_maneuver: "Primacy of Manoeuvre"
 UKR_primacy_of_maneuver_desc: "Fighting a war of attrition against Russia is an exercise in futility. In the endless plains of Ukraine and Russia, manoeuvre is the key to victory. Whoever can strike first and move fastest will gain the edge, and if they are tenacious enough, they will keep it."
 UKR_valour_and_victory: "Valour & Victory"
 UKR_valour_and_victory_desc: "While a soldier's physical skills matter, what truly creates victory is their moral character. Valour was how the Greeks could defeat great Persian armies: valour is how we defeated Napoleon, and lack of it was what caused the downfall of the Russian armies two decades prior.

 UKR_general_staff_reorganisation_desc: "The old system proved its faults during the 1936 uprising. System of Hetman-appointed regional Otamans was too unwieldy, and often the Otamans either had to wait for orders for long time, or went entirely outside their given orders. This military adventurism must stop, and the system needs to be formalised properly."

With the Hetman's new reforms, he believes that a regular professional army no longer serves the needs of the Ukrainian state, and instead, a mobilization and conscription should be announced to deal with the manpower problem."

 UKR_shock_artillery_fire_desc: "Sometimes, using artillery fire is necessary not so much for defeating the enemy, as much as disorganising and discombobulating it.

 UKR_reverse_engineer_artillery: "Reverse Engineer Foreign Artillery"
 UKR_reverse_engineer_artillery_desc: "Artillery has become more and more useful in warfare, so much so that many frontline battalions nowadays are exclusively based on punishing artillery fire.

 UKR_review_structure_desc: "The Skoropadskyi-era army was too rigid, too hierarchical. It was not capable of fast enough decision-making nor improvisation.

Under German and Austrian pressures that culminated in the crowning of King Vasyl I. The struggle between King and the Hetman, Pavlo Skoropadskyi has been going on since then. However, the population can find the solution in more radical and republican parties."


### Events ###
ukraine.1.t: "Our Kingdom"
ukraine.1.d: "The Kingdom of Ukraine proclaimed its independence with German support on 25th January 1918, a state of affairs that was quickly ratified by the Peace of Nations agreement at Brest-Litovsk. An initial experiment with socialism in the form of a People’s Republic was swiftly expunged by a German-backed coup. This operation, led by the strongman and former general in the Russian army Pavlo Skoropadskyi, set the tone for Ukraine’s future. It was to be a breadbasket used by a military-aristocrat elite from across Eastern Europe as a source of food, a convenient market for goods and a military bulwark against the weakened Russian Republic. For a time the dispute between Germany and its Austro-Hungarian ally over Ukrainian rumbled on after the Weltkrieg, eventually settling on a compromise whereby King Vasily, an Austrian archduke born Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, would rule with the support of Skoropadskyi, who as the German-allied 'Hetman', holds incredible powers of both civil and military affairs. By 1927, German involvement in the Austrian Ausgleich negotiations meant that Ukraine fell de-facto into the hands of the Hetman, with King Vasily becoming an increasingly marginalised figure. Ukraine under the Hetmanate has become the breadbasket of the Reichspakt, and made its wealthy landowners exorbinantly wealthy, but at the expense of the Ukrainian peasantry. Now, almost twenty years after the Weltkrieg the national situation is unstable. The Reich forces us to sell our goods almost exclusively to nations within its sphere of influence while Socialists gain popularity amongst the downtrodden rural poor and city workers with each passing day. Both ethnic Russians and the pro-Russian population dream of unification with our former master to the East while Ukrainian nationalists proclaim that our Kingdom is no more than a German puppet. This is a immutable truth. Despite these many issues afflicting us, our land is prosperous and fertile, our people industrious and our potential boundless."
ukraine.1.a: "Shche Ne Vmerla Ukraina!"
ukraine.2.t: "The Ukrainian Government"
ukraine.2.d: "It is fair to say that our government is divided. While Pavlo Skoropadskyi does his best to solve the antagonism between the army, consisting of former officers of the Russian Imperial Army, and the civil administration, most of which actively supports our current position in the Reichspakt, many of Ukraine’s problems can only be solved when the majority of our population - the kulaks and peasants - have an opportunity to sell their substantial agricultural produce in Europe beyond the narrow confines of the Reichspakt."
ukraine.2.a: "We shouldn't provoke the peasants!"
ukraine.3.t: "Black Monday Hits Ukraine!"
ukraine.3.d: "Almost two weeks ago the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into the abyss, throwing Germany’s economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now that the crash’s shock waves have reached the Ukraine, German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ukrainian Hrivna is losing value, and resource exports are shrinking exponentially."
ukraine.3.a: "Let us hope that Europe remains open to us."
ukraine.4.t: "Agricultural Crisis!"
ukraine.4.d: "Since the Weltkrieg, Ukraine has traditionally relied upon its valuable grain trade with the German Empire in order to maintain its economic security. Unfortunately the current socio-economic issues afflicting the Reich have meant that it is now far more interested in protecting its own farmers than taking the politically unpopular move of subsidising Ukrainian agriculture. This could be very dangerous for us as without support from the German market, our ruling class of agrarian landowners could find it difficult to maintain their dominance in the countryside."
ukraine.4.a: "We're still the breadbasket of Europe, right?"
ukraine.5.t: "Faith and Nation"
ukraine.5.d: "Before the agricultural crisis pro-Russian movements were rather weak and disunited, ensuring they didn't pose much of a threat to our government. This crisis has led to a shocking rise in popular support for these organisations and an increase in their willingness to cooperate. Yesterday a famous Russian writer from Kyiv, Mikhail Bulgakov, proclaimed the unification of the three largest movements into a singular organisation known as 'Faith and Nation' ('Vera i Narod') or just 'ViN'. Supported by the Ukrainian Church, itself heavily influenced by the Moscow Patriarchate, the population of Southern and Eastern Ukraine and many high-ranking officers, this movement could provoke serious instability in some parts of our country."
ukraine.5.a: "We really must protest!"

ukraine.7.t: "Dmitri Dontsov Deported From Galicia-Lodomeria"
ukraine.7.d: "Dmitri Dontsov, an renowned ideologue of Ukrainian nationalism, has been deported from Galicia, where he had urged the local Ukrainian minority to resist the Austro-Hungarian administration. He now claims that our silence on the crisis has exposed the weakness of our government, and that’s why Ukraine should be ruled by 'real Ukrainian patriots'. His slogan 'Ukraine for the Ukrainians' is attractive to many citizens, especially in Western Ukraine, and graffiti has been spotted in a number of towns. This could be dangerous for the cabinet, since we've already lost considerable support in the East."
ukraine.7.a: "Welcome home I suppose..."
ukraine.8.t: "Khrushchev criticises the Ukrainian government."
ukraine.8.d: "Nikita Khrushchev, a prominent Ukrainian social democrat, has opened the 3rd Congress of the Ukrainian Syndicalist Party. He demands that the government takes extreme measures to defend the workers and peasants from poverty brought on by the global crash. To further this agenda he has proposed a new programme of major social and economic reforms aimed at helping Ukraine overcome the crisis. The controversial figure is going to present his plan in the Rada soon."
ukraine.8.a: "Extreme measures? This stinks of Bolshevikism!"
ukraine.9.t: "Our Future"
ukraine.9.d: "The agricultural crisis has almost shattered the Ukrainian economy and the stability of many of the nation’s most important institutions. The King’s grip on the country is weakening by the hour, peasants loyal to the Hetman want major land reform, pro-Russian malcontents and Ukrainian nationalists demand radical measures and the Socialists are mobilising workers all over the country. Various political movements struggle for power in our teetering nation, and soon we have to choose who will lead Ukraine into the future."
ukraine.9.a: "Ukraine will stagger on as it always has!"
ukraine.10.t: "Khrushchev’s Speech"
ukraine.10.d: "As one of the few social democrats in the Rada, Nikita Khrushchev wields an mesmerising degree of influence over the Ukrainian peasantry and urban rabble. He has taken advantage of our troubles in a recent speech, where he has openly called for sweeping land reforms, an extension of the electoral franchise and an end to landlord dominance in the countryside. These demands are extremely popular among the lower classes, and are giving them ideas dangerous to national stability. Despite this, perhaps we could make use of Khrushchev’s popularity and allow him to become the face of economic reforms unpopular amongst the rural landlords that we would otherwise take a political hit over anyway."
ukraine.10.a: "Dismiss Skoropadskyi and invite Khrushchev to head a popular government."
ukraine.11.t: "The Language Issue"
ukraine.11.d: "Nikita Khrushchev has joined the government as leader during one of the darkest periods in our nation’s history since 1918. However, before solving the economic problems it is imperative that Khrushchev respond to the burgeoning pro-Russian movement, which has had a malign impact on our electorate in industrial Ukraine. One method that could help neutralise their popularity is by addressing the language question, a domestic dilemma that has been lingering for years. The Russian language is used de-facto by a substantial percentage of the population, however its usage is expressly prohibited in state institutions. This has given rise to accusations that Russians are treated as second-class citizens."
ukraine.11.a: "Make Russian the second official state language."
ukraine.11.b: "Arrest important pro-Russian leaders."
ukraine.12.t: "National-Socialists Protest!"
ukraine.12.d: "Notable Ukrainian National-Syndicalists Vlas Chubar and Alexander Shumskyi oppose Khrushchev’s decision to allow the usage of the Russian language in administrative institutions. They claim that this measure won't help to unify our country and that unopposed usage of the Russian language will lead to the growth of the separatist organisations in Southern and Eastern Ukrainian."
ukraine.12.a: "Millions of our workers don't think so."
ukraine.12.b: "All right, all right. Restore the status quo."
ukraine.13.t: "Pro-Russian Leaders Stir Up Trouble"
ukraine.13.d: "Leaders of the different pro-Russian movements have unfortunately managed to escape Ukrainian soil before they could be arrested. Many have sought temporary exile in Romania and Russia, with both nations somewhat hostile to our pro-German regime and aware of the Kaiser’s gaze turning west. Mikhail Bulgakov has announced publicly that the nationalist umbrella organisation 'Faith and Nation' is ready to fight for the rights of Russians in Ukraine. Maybe we have made a big mistake."
ukraine.13.a: "Another problem!"

ukraine.16.t: "The Fate of the Ukrainian Monarchy"
ukraine.16.d: "His Majesty King Vasily I Vyshyvanyi gave Nikita Khrushchev extensive powers in a bid to control the revolutionary trends sweeping the country in the aftermath of the crisis. Now that Khrushchev’s initial programme has been implemented successfully, many interest groups within Ukraine have begun debating the continued prominence of the monarchy considering its relative powerlessness in the face of recent crises."
ukraine.16.a: "The bourgeoisie like liberty, but would prefer a less radical government."
ukraine.16.b: "The poor love Khrushchev, but hate the King! Long live the Republic!"
ukraine.16.c: "The King shall invite Volodymyr Chekhivskyi to save the people and the kingdom."
ukraine.17.t: "A New Minister of Security?"
ukraine.17.d: "Igor Kistyakovskyi has been our minister of Security since 1918 but recently had to retire from his post because of his poor health. 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian Nationalists' have immediately started fighting for this position because each party hopes to increase their influence over Ukrainian internal policy. We have to give 'ViN' or 'SUN' this post, according to the power-sharing agreement concluded before the elections."
ukraine.17.a: "Volodymyr Khitrovo from 'ViN'"
ukraine.17.b: "Volodymyr Chekhovskyi from 'SUN'"
ukraine.17.c: "Danylo Skoropadskyi, son of our Hetman."
ukraine.18.t: "Free Trade Area With the Ukraine"
ukraine.18.d: "The new Ukrainian government has sought to reconstruct the economy by establishing a free trade area between the Ukraine and the Russian market. This virtual erasure of eye-watering tarrifs and customs duties at the border would be a substantial boon for our own merchants and industrialists. Furthermore, opening up the largely agrarian Ukrainian market to Russian importers desperate to feed the austerity-hit masses in Russia’s major cities would massively boost our economy..."
ukraine.18.a: "Launch this project!"
ukraine.19.t: "Free Trade Area Results in Profits"
ukraine.19.d: "The free trade area with Ukraine has shown its benefits. The borderlands, which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg, are now home to a number of new collieries and ironworks and our urban poor now have access to cheap Ukrainian grain to supplement their diet. The unemployment rate has been reduced substantially in certain key sectors. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
ukraine.19.a: "Great."
ukraine.20.t: "Free Trade Area Results in Profits"
ukraine.20.d: "The free trade area with Russia has shown its benefits. The borderlands, which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg, are now home to a number of new collieries and ironworks and our grain, previously rotting in the fields, now has access to a massive market in the form of the Russian urban poor. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest level since 1918. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
ukraine.20.a: "Great."
ukraine.21.t: "Prosvita is Effective!"
ukraine.21.d: "The activities of the Prosvita Movement have had a demonstrably positive influence on our youth, with membership numbers soaring into the hundreds of thousands at least. A number of young people are ready to defend their country, culture and traditions. They will be perfect recruits for our armed forces."
ukraine.21.a: "That’s right young men, enrol in the army!"
ukraine.22.t: "Regional Languages"
ukraine.22.d: "Though Skoropadskyi refused to recognise the Russian language as a second state language, he allowed the Ukrainian regions to choose which languages could be officially recognised. Now that the majority of our regions have recognised the Russian language, Skoropadskyi has finally conceded to give it the same position in a national scale."
ukraine.22.a: "'Yazyk' and 'Mova' should have a common future in Ukraine!"
ukraine.23.t: "Ukraine Request Recovery Aid"
ukraine.23.d: "The Ukrainian government has asked us for a relatively substantial loan, which they wish to use for the electrification of the poorest grain-growers. One of our major Reichspakt allies and the bastion of our Ostwall against a Russian resurgence, Ukraine’s situation is already incredibly unstable, in part due to our protectionist measures during Black Week that proved detrimental to Ukrainian agriculture."
ukraine.23.a: "Very well. Grant them the money."
ukraine.23.b: "Who cares about Ukraine?"
ukraine.24.t: "Germany Grants Us a Loan!"
ukraine.24.d: "The German Empire has accepted our request! Now we can invest this money into the electrification of the villages in Central Ukraine, which promises to increase our support amongst the peasantry, boost our agricultural productivity and improve our rural economy. Germany’s decision is perhaps not surprising. Ukraine is, after all, a much better place to invest in than Poland!"
ukraine.24.a: "Germany is truly our friend and protector!"
ukraine.25.t: "The Electrification is Complete!"
ukraine.25.d: "With the aid of loans from the German government, our government has finally been able to electrify virtually all of the villages in Central Ukraine, greatly improving the agricultural yields of our peasant farms. As a result of this and our previous measures Ukraine has finally begun to recover from the crushing effects of Black Monday."
ukraine.25.a: "Great!"
ukraine.26.t: "Germany Has Declined to Grant Us a Loan!"
ukraine.26.d: "The German Empire is not going to help us with investment. We must either increase our taxes or abandon this plan."
ukraine.26.a: "We can use our own resources. Time to raise the taxes."
ukraine.26.b: "These reforms weren't necessary anyway..."
ukraine.27.t: "The Electrification is Complete!"
ukraine.27.d: "Even though Germany refused to grant us loans, our government has finally been able to electrify virtually all of the villages in Central Ukraine through increased taxation, greatly improving the agricultural yields of our peasant farms. As a result of this and our previous measures Ukraine has finally begun to recover from the crushing effects of Black Monday."
ukraine.27.a: "It was worth it."
ukraine.28.t: "Another Ukrainian Loan"
ukraine.28.d: "The Ukrainian government asked us for a loan again, which they want to use for the industrialisation of the Eastern part of the Ukraine to quell Socialist power there. However, the size of this loan is much bigger than the one before. Many senior personnel in our administration believe that the rise of Syndicalism in Ukraine is a direct threat to Reichspakt solidarity."
ukraine.28.a: "Very well, give them the money."
ukraine.28.b: "There is a crisis in Germany, you know."
ukraine.29.t: "Germany Granted Us Another Loan"
ukraine.29.d: "The German Empire has accepted our request for further capital! Now we can invest this money into the industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine. It should help us to defeat the burgeoning Socialist movement there."
ukraine.29.a: "Very well."
ukraine.30.t: "Industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine"
ukraine.30.d: "Many workers in Eastern Ukraine have gotten new jobs in emerging industries due to our investment there, funded by the loan from Germany. As a result our loyalty amongst the urban poor has grown immensely, greatly neutering the power of the Socialist movement there. We have recovered from Black Monday, while also crippling the power base of the trade unions!"
ukraine.30.a: "Two birds with one stone. Fantastic!"
ukraine.31.t: "Germany Refused A Second Loan!"
ukraine.31.d: "The Germany Empire is not going to help us with investment in our industrial East, shortsightedly forgetting that the more power Syndicalism gains in Eastern Europe, the greater the threat to their interests. We must choose whether to increase our taxes or abandon this plan entirely."
ukraine.31.a: "Time to raise taxes."
ukraine.31.b: "It’s too damn expensive!"
ukraine.32.t: "The Industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine"
ukraine.32.d: "Many workers in Eastern Ukraine have gotten new jobs in emerging industries due to our investment there, funded by extra taxes levied on the population. As a result our loyalty amongst the urban poor has grown immensely, greatly neutering the power of the Socialist movement there. We have recovered from Black Monday, while also crippling the power base of the trade unions!"
ukraine.32.a: "Two birds with one stone. Fantastic!"
ukraine.33.t: "Ukraine asks for help!"
ukraine.33.d: "Ukraine, a new Syndicalist nation in Eastern Europe led by Nikita Khrushchev, has requested our support. They cannot start the reform of their industry alone and they have turned to friendly nations overseas for help. There are some plans that have been proposed by our economy minister - the question is which one should we choose?"
ukraine.33.a: "Time to help their military industry!"
ukraine.33.b: "Let’s build a brewing facility in Kyiv!"
ukraine.33.c: "They can do everything without us."
ukraine.34.t: "Syndicalist Ukraine Leaves the Reichspakt"
ukraine.34.d: "The treacherous Ukrainians have deserted the Reichspakt, jeopardising the sphere of influence in Eastern European that we have spent twenty years carefully constructing. Many hotheads in the general staff have suggesed direct military action to punish the new Syndicalist government and deter other potential insurrectionists. Doing so could be extremely unwise however as Ukraine possesses one of the largest armed forces in Europe and they are critical for our long-term plans as a bulwark against a belligerent Russia. Members of the Abwehr have instead suggested that we ought to use our ties with many senior Ukrainian army officials to instigate a reactionary coup d'etat in Kyiv. The choice now is how we should react to this clear betrayal."
ukraine.34.a: "We do not have the resources to respond."
ukraine.34.b: "Covert operations should be resolve this."
ukraine.34.c: "Crush the Syndicalist traitors!"
ukraine.35.t: "German Military Mission Leaves the Ukraine"
ukraine.35.d: "Following our decision to leave the hated the Reichspakt bloc, the German military mission present in our country since 1918 has finally left! Already, officers and advisers that had been stationed on the Ostwall, in Sevastopol and the capital Kyiv, have been surreptitiously evacuated over the course of the day. This is truly a testament to an independent Ukraine."
ukraine.35.a: "The chains are broken, for now at least."

ukraine.37.t: "Ukraine Requests To Join The Internationale"
ukraine.37.d: "The government of the Ukraine have recently announced their intention of joining the Syndicalist bloc in the face of German reactionism in Eastern Europe. Unlike the vast majority of Internationale members Ukraine’s Syndicalist government stems not from revolutionary activity, but working with monarchists and German stooges in government - making them most unorthodox. Still, Ukrainian peasants would be useful in the crusade against the bloodthirsty Germans and Canadian pigs."
ukraine.37.a: "Together we shall envelop the hated Bosche!"
ukraine.37.b: "Their chain-breaking credentials are... unworthy."
ukraine.38.t: "We Join the International"
ukraine.38.d: "The International is happy to see us joining the common cause, namely, destroying the evil imperialists. Now we are in the Syndicalist bloc we are part of a united struggle that stretches from Luhanks to London. Only together can we survive in the face of reactionary terror."
ukraine.38.a: "We will defend our liberty and independence!"
ukraine.39.t: "Attempt at a Military Coup"
ukraine.39.d: "German agitators, with the help of reactionary officers and a part of our armed forces, have launched a coup against our government and are trying to restore the pro-German regime in Ukraine. Elements of the Military Mission that had previously been deployed in key garrisons on the Ostwall, in Sevastopol port and in the capital joined forces with pro-German troops and have started running street battles near the ministry buildings. The country is in absolute chaos and liable to deteriorate further, with the survival of Syndicalism in Ukraine on a knife-edge. How will the situation develop?"
ukraine.39.a: "The reactionary putschists secure Kyiv!"
ukraine.39.b: "The Red militias successfully defend Kyiv!"
ukraine.40.t: "Reactionary Coup in the Ukraine Succeeds"
ukraine.40.d: "Members of the German Military Mission together, with reactionary members of the Ukrainian armed forces, have successfully seized control of Kyiv, overthrowing the Syndicalist government and replacing it with one again loyal to the German Empire. After a number of street battles and open warfare raging in government buildings, the putschists began purging Reds wherever they could find them. A nervous King Vasily was given sweeping powers by a pliant Rada and again signed Ukraine up as a formal member of the Reichspakt. We have successfully prevented the poison of Syndicalism from spreading any further in Eastern Europe, and for this the Abwehr should be commended."
ukraine.40.a: "Excellent!"
ukraine.41.t: "Military Coup in the Ukraine Failed"
ukraine.41.d: "Our attempt to replace the government in Ukraine with one loyal to our state has failed miserably. Though our Military Mission staff and a number of anti-Syndicalist elements of the Ukrainian army managed to launch a coup d'etat in Kyiv and seize a number of government buildings, they were swiftly overwhelmed by Red militias and executed en-masse. What should we do now? Already widows of the fallen are baying for blood."
ukraine.41.a: "There is nothing we can do..."
ukraine.41.b: "War will solve this!"

ukraine.43.t: "No support from France!"
ukraine.43.d: "Though the Commune of France knows about our internal problems, it seems that they are not going to help us... at least for the moment. This is perhaps not too surprising given the situation that they find themselves in. Despite the setback, we have to be persistent and hope that we will improve our relations with the strongest Syndicalist nation in the world in future."
ukraine.43.a: "Let’s hope they won't forget us completely."
ukraine.44.t: "Ukrainian Claim On Bessarabia"
ukraine.44.d: "Bessarabia was occupied by Romanian Forces on the 27th of March, 1918. Back then, we couldn't do a thing, but now we might just have a chance to set this injustice right. Since the current international situation is favourable for us, we should renew our claims on Bessarabia and retake it from Romania."
ukraine.44.a: "The Iron Guard must accept our demands."
ukraine.44.b: "The King must give us back our land!"
ukraine.45.t: "Ukrainian Demands"
ukraine.45.d: "Yesterday, the Ukrainian government demanded the return of the Bessarabia region that we seized back in 1918. If we fold to the Ukrainian claims, we will lose a substantial portion of our territory and the name of the Iron Legion will live on infamy, but if we refuse, we could very well face an immediate invasion by our powerful neighbour. How should we react to these dreadful demands from our northern rival?"
ukraine.45.a: "Accept their demands."
ukraine.45.b: "Never! Bessarabia is Romanian!"
ukraine.46.t: "Iron Guard Romania Refuses!"
ukraine.46.d: "The Iron Guard leadership in Romania have published a note, which insists that Bessarabia is rightful Romanian territory, and that no Ukrainian soldier will set foot on its sovereign territory. The treatise is filled with xenophobic remarks and references to history which have caused outrage and dismay in government circles, and upon it being leaked to the press, the wider public. The Romanian Legionaries have given us great offence."
ukraine.46.a: "Then it is war!"
ukraine.46.b: "Return Bessarabia."
ukraine.47.t: "Ukrainian Demands"
ukraine.47.d: "Yesterday, the Ukrainian government demanded the return of the Bessarabia region that we seized back in 1918. If we fold to the Ukrainian claims, we will lose a substantial portion of our territory and besmirch the dignity of our Crown, but if we refuse, we could very well face an immediate invasion by our powerful neighbour. How should we react to these dreadful demands from our northern rival?"
ukraine.47.a: "Accept their terms."
ukraine.47.b: "Never!"
ukraine.48.t: "Romania refuses!"
ukraine.48.d: "The Romanian King has published a note, where he insists that Bessarabia is rightful Romanian territory, and that no Ukrainian soldier will set foot on his sovereign territory. The only solution to this problem is the war with the Romanians."
ukraine.48.a: "Then it is war."
ukraine.48.b: "Return Bessarabia."
ukraine.52.t: "An Heir to King Vasily?"
ukraine.52.d: "Unfortunately, our King has no children and as such theoretically has the right to choose his successor. In practice however, this decision is up to the Ukrainian government itself and only two candidates are even being considered by senior ministers. The nephew of Vasily, Leo Stefan Habsburg and Danylo Skoropadskyi, son of our Hetman, are both contenders for the throne. 'ViN' and 'SUN' support Danylo as they believe he will weaken Ukrainian dependence on the Reichspakt by virtue of his lack of royal ties with the European dynasties. Leo, despite his dynastic ties, only has support from Skoropadskyi’s opponents and employers, many of whom have serious connections with Germany and Austria. The question now is which is preferable. Some also propose to abolish the German monarchy which was imposed on us at the death of the King."
ukraine.52.a: "Leo Stefan Habsburg!"
ukraine.52.b: "Danylo Skoropadskyi!"
ukraine.52.c: "The time of the monarchy will soon be over..."
ukraine.53.t: "A New Minister of Security?"
ukraine.53.d: "Igor Kistyakovskyi has been our minister of Security since 1918 but recently had to retire from his post because of his poor health.

ukraine.53.c: "Danylo Skoropadskyi, son of our Hetman."
ukraine.54.t: "Explosion on the Dnieper"
ukraine.54.d: "Today at 11 a.m. while our King Vasily was relaxing on his yacht, an explosion ripped through the hull immediately killing him. Our minister of security has just received a telegram from a Syndicalist group claiming responsibility for mining His yacht, stating that the action was as a result of their exclusion from the democratic process. There was no chance to save our King and already the country has been plunged into disorder. The new monarch, Leo Stefan Habsburg, has promised to work with the new ruling party to suppress the Syndicalist threat."

ukraine.61.t: "Treaty of Pereyaslav"
ukraine.61.d: "Since the dismemberment of the Russian Empire after the Weltkrieg, both Russia and the Ukraine have been independent countries with their own destinies. At the same time, both states have proven to be weaker apart than united. Now, with each state having reached some level of domestic stability, more and more citizens in both nations are calling for reunification particularly due to the rule of the Russophile Vera i Narod party in Ukraine. Although it could lead to a split with the Reichspakt this might be the one great chance for Great and Little Rus to reunite into a resurgent Greater Russia - a state that can confidently oppose Germanic hegemony in Eastern Europe."
ukraine.61.a: "Together with Russia, the Ukraine shall prosper for a thousand years!"
ukraine.61.b: "We must retain independence!"

Although it could lead to a split with the Reichspakt this might be the one great chance for Great and Little Rus to reunite into a resurgent Greater Russia - a state that can confidently oppose Germanic hegemony in Eastern Europe.

ukraine.63.d: "After some time witnessing the efficiency and justice of the union between Russia and the Ukraine, the reluctant inhabitants of the Western parts of the Ukraine have finally accepted the benefits and self-evident righteousness of the reunification of Little and Great Russia. What was once two nations divided by our enemies has become one indivisible whole, and it is all the stronger for the tribulations we have both endured."
ukraine.63.a: "Proud Russians all."

ukraine.71.t: "Ukraine proposes an alliance!"
ukraine.71.d: "Ukraine has come to us offering a military alliance, promising us access to their vast agricultural system, Black Sea ports and the undermining of Germany’s the Reichspakt bloc. While it'd certainly be good to stand with our Slavic brothers, the reaction from Germany would be unfavourable to say the least. What should we do?"
ukraine.71.a: "Accept the offer!"
ukraine.71.b: "We do not need this."
ukraine.72.t: "Russia Accepted The Proposal!"
ukraine.72.d: "Russia agreed that we should be in the same alliance, which will secure Eastern Europe both from the German imperialists and Syndicalist threat. the Reichspakt couldn't make us hate our brothers from Great Russia, which is why we decided to form this alliance - and we believe it will also be profitable for us."

ukraine.73.t: "Ukraine Abandons the Reichspakt For Russia"
ukraine.73.d: "An absolutely disgraceful situation has emerged on our eastern flank. Ukraine, supposedly our loyal ally and the linchpin of our Ostwall defences, has left the Reichspakt and entered an alliance with the Russians, asserting their independence from German control. Diplomatic heads have been rolling in Berlin all day. We can't risk a war with the Russians over Ukraine regardless of what some officials are calling for, surely?"

For the first time in many centuries however we are finally free from the German, Russian and more alike, sovereign is our people and now they look toward the bright future. However it seems as however bright that future is, one thing cannot be clearly seen through the radiant sun rays is exactly what kind of Sovereignity the Ukrainian nation should exercize, many of our people wish only to enjoy their new found freedom in peace while others wish for us to look outward as a actor of the world stage rather than inward."

Therefore it is unacceptable to maintain the current military command structure, these reactionaries will be demoted and replaced will those loyal to our great Comrade, for the sake of stability and avoiding any possible outright insurgencies it has been advised not to completely purge these generals. For now at least..."
ukraine.82.a: "Loyalty has its rewards..."
ukraine.83.t: "Populyarnyy front"
ukraine.83.d: "The Popular Front is a common name used to refer to an unofficial coalition of left-wing forces, primarily composing of moderate social-democrats, socialists and vanguardists. Despite the conflicting views held by the factions they remain a united force primarily thanks to Khrushchev, whose cult like following amongst the peasantry has allowed himself and his allies to coerce the moderates into remaining loyal. For now Khrushchev has held back on previous radical promises such as the abolishment of the monarchy in order to appease the social democratic majority who wish for progressive change, his increasingly vague stances have helped maintain the Front’s unity whilst not completely rejecting the will of his hardcore supporters. The social-democratic majority also serves as a tool used by Khrushchev to appeal to Vasyl who would surely oppose co-operation had the vanguardists been given a larger platform."

ukraine.85.d: "Due to the nature of Vasyl’s death, his successor was unable to have a proper coronation.

ukraine.88.d: "With no party attaining a majority in the Rada, King Vasyl, perhaps out of fear for a Syndicalist revolution, has called for snap elections across Ukraine, with voting to be held in one month’s time. There have also been raucous protests on the main square in Kyiv to ban the more extreme reactionary parties from the ballot in fears that they may jeopardize the integrity of the election."

We have the popular mandate, after all."
ukraine.90.a: "No more of this 'election' nonsense."
ukraine.91.t: "A Rightist Coalition"
ukraine.91.d: "After much negotiation, we have decided to form a coalition in the Rada with Pavlo Skoropadskyi’s UND as well as a 'confidence and supply' agreement with our rivals on the right wing in order to keep the liberal and syndicalist parties from attaining a minority government and preserving the stability of the Kingdom. This should also prevent us from having to hold any more elections."

ukraine.92.d: "The popular coalition government has served as a bulwark against extremism in this trying time for our nation. After the shocking death of the king who brought democracy to our nation, Syndicalists have been rounded up and banned from government in an effort to prevent those responsible from taking control in the next election. Meanwhile, the Nationalists have more or less become a fringe party and early polls are showing they will likely not reach the threshold to be on the ballot in the next election. Furthermore, reports coming out of Ukrainian newspapers discovered a plot by Pavlo Skoropadskyi to undermine Ukrainian democracy by dissolving the Rada had they received a majority in the previous election and as such have been banned from future elections."
ukraine.92.a: "Good riddance!"
ukraine.93.t: "Memories of the Republic"
ukraine.93.d: "While most of the country has been divided between the right-wing elite and the left-wing peasants, there is a growing contingent of middle-class Ukrainians who remember the days of the short-lived UPR, in which everyday people- not only the elites- had a voice in the government. Protests have been mounting in Kyiv in recent days to implement moderate reforms based on the model of Western democracies such as those found in Scandinavia, stopping short of a total governmental overhaul but instead calling for open elections to solve the deadlock in the Rada. While a minority of these protesters are ardent republicans, many seem open to the idea of retaining Vasyl as a constitutional monarch. One of Ukraine’s most prominent generals, Symon Petliura, has expressed their support for the protests, saying that allowing free elections to the Rada could go a long way to bridge the gap between left and right, and perhaps even solve the ongoing agricultural crisis."
ukraine.93.a: "Maybe it’s time to take them seriously."
ukraine.101.t: "An Overture from Kyiv"
ukraine.101.d: "With the recent declaration of an independent alliance between the Black and Baltic seas front in the form of the [ROOT.GetFactionName] by the Ukrainian nation, it seems that we have been invited to join their fold, bolstering their alliance of sovereign nations between the Austrian, German and Russian spheres."
ukraine.101.a: "We must join in brotherhood!."
ukraine.101.b: "We need no aid from the Ukrainians."
ukraine.102.t: "The [From.GetName] joins our cause!"
ukraine.102.d: "Great news in the capital today as following our offer to bring the [From.GetName] into the [ROOT.GetFactionName], we have received positive a positive response from them. Already, diplomats between them and us transit between Kyiv and their nation to discuss shared military affairs."
ukraine.102.a: "Splendid!."
ukraine.103.t: "The [From.GetName] refuses us!"
ukraine.103.d: "It would seem that our visit and invitation to the [From.GetName] has gone rather poorly, having only been rebuked upon their arrival. We will have to search for allies elsewhere."
ukraine.103.a: "We didn't need them anyway."
ukraine.103.t: "The German Empire falls to Revolution!"
ukraine.103.d: "In an extrodinary turn of events, the German nation, once the great bulwark against the communards and Russians alike now itself flies the colors of revolution!. Now we are stuck between the Anvil hammer of the Reds and Russians, we must secure Eastern Europe with our other former allies at once!."

monsocukr.1.t: "A Bloody Red Morning"
monsocukr.1.d: "This morning at 8 sharp, King Vasyl I was shot and killed during his daily morning walk. Long preferring to walk alone without his usual accompaniment of guards, the fact something like this did not happen early is a bit shocking. The assassin, apprehended as soon as the shots were heard, was a member of the banned Communist Party of Ukraine, led by one Nikita Khrushchev, long an opponent of our regime. Despite this, the King’s death could not come at a more opportune time. Although supportive of our reforms, the King had yet to fully embrace the rebirth of the revolution. With his death, Leo Stefan von Habsburg, not yet even a teenager, has been chosen by our government to replace the late King. Due to him still having years before he can fully take on his responsibilities, Leo Stefan, now King Lev III, is a perfect match, as he can be shown the truths of our ideals and policies. The Kingdom may mourn the death of her late King, but with his death comes a new dawn for the nation, under the dual rule of the Monarchy and the People’s Government."
monsocukr.1.a: "The King is dead, Long Live the King!"

monsocukr.2.t: "The Case of the Khrushchevites"
monsocukr.2.d: "After months of preparation, the trial of Khrushchev, his closest allies, and his entire party apparatus has finally begun. Charged with conspiracy to assassinate the late King, the trial is a forgone conclusion. While all will get a chance to speak, present evidence and defend themselves, all know that  the Khrushchevites are doomed to swing.\n\nThe trial itself was a simple affair, and hearkened back to the various show trials that the Bolsheviks carried out in the final days of the Soviet uprising.  Each and every man was convicted of treason, with the rope waiting for Khrushchev and others. What’s more, the KMS has been formally banned, it’s assets seized and turned over to the People’s Government. While this was a small step, it is a necessary one, for to truly revitalize the nation, the rot must be purged out."
monsocukr.2.a: "So long you bastard. Good riddance."

monsocukr.3.t: "An Alliance for the Future of Ukraine"
monsocukr.3.d: "Of all the various political factions we find ourselves competing against within Ukraine, the National-Syndicalists, under the control of Oleksandr Shumskyi, are the closest to us in terms of policy. Wishing to build a syndicalist state within a revived Ukraine is the gist of the their policy, and the similarities between our own program is quite striking. Seeing as how we both find ourselves adrift in a sea of hostile ideologies, it has been agreed that both of our parties should merge, allowing us to implement our programs all the easier. Mykhailo Yalovy, our foreign minister, is a personal friend of Shumskyi, thus making the merger all the easier.\n\nThis merger is, of course, not just for convenience, it also allows us to keep a closer eye on Shumskyi, as he is seen as a threat to our rule. Regardless, with the merger of our two parties, the future of Ukraine looks ever the brighter."
monsocukr.3.a: "Arm-in-arm, we work for the betterment of the nation."

monsocukr.5.t: "Against the Russian Menace"
monsocukr.5.d: "Of all the nations that have come to dominate our beloved homeland, none have been more horrid then that of the Russian bear.  Be it the subjaction of our people, the attempts to force us to become Russians or even the near-destruction of our culture, we have suffered more at the hands of the Russians then anyone else. No Longer! With a government that truly cares for the people finally in power within Ukraine, we shall reverse the table. Those Russians foolish enough to our lands shall be forced out, and driven back to 'Mother Russia.' Our Eastern lands shall be purified, and the same horror they inflicted on us will be inflicted upon them. When the time finally comes for us to stand against the Bear, we shall hold the line, for we know that a truly free Ukraine, by the People for the People, lives and dies with us!"
monsocukr.5.a: "Death to the Bear!"

monsocukr.6.t: "To Arms for Ukraine!"
monsocukr.6.d: "In the history of our great nation, figures such as Volodymyr the Great stand out as true heros to the national cause, These figures are known to every true son of Ukraine, and their model still serves as perfect examples for our armed forces. Bohdan Khmelnytskyi is one such man. Fighting against the oppressive rule of the Poles, Khmelnytskyi’s might established a free nation that we are the inheritors of such. In emulation of his legacy, and the government’s own promotion of men such like him, various militias of peasants have formed, and have begun attacking and seizing land from Polish nobles that inhabit the west of our country. While these raids have been fairly tame, it cannot be said they don't show what a rallied up people can do. Within the sized lands, the former palaces of the landowning Poles have been transformed into massive schools, greatly increasing education within our rural population. What’s more, the land sized has actually been handed over to government control by the people, giving us the chance to see it divided up correctly. With more raids planned or ongoing, it seems the people have finally found an outlet for years of oppression."
monsocukr.6.a: "A victory for the masses!"

monsocukr.7.t: "Terrorist Activity in Bessarabia!"
monsocukr.7.d: "Bessarabia has long been one of most contested areas of land, claimed  by both the Russians and Ukrainians, thus it is no surprise that both have hungrily eyed the land since the end of the Weltkrieg. While both have waited for a moment of weakness, waiting for us to slip up so they could size Bessarabia out from under us. It seems however, that this period of relative peace has ended. Over the course of the past few days, a string of terror attacks, carried out by what appears to be a contingent of Cossacks fighting what they claim is a 'modern day Yasir for the Ukrainian population in Bessarabia.'\n\nWhile we have no evidence besides hearsay, it is believed these Cossacks are agents of the 'Monarcho-Socialist' government in Kyiv. Seemingly confirming this, Kyiv has offered to subdue these terrorists, in exchange for 'temporary authority' over Bessarabia. In other words, they are demanding we hand over Bessarabia or the attacks will continue, if not all out war between our two nations. While such a war would no doubt be easily won, many within our government are calling for us to cave to Ukraine and to focus on reclaiming the rest of Greater Romania, saying we can always get the land back later. Whatever our choice, we must do something quickly, before even more lives are lost. "
monsocukr.7.a: "It will take more then terrorists for us to hand over our land!"
monsocukr.7.b: "Enough! The Ukrainians can have the land, it’s not worth the human toll."

monsocukr.8.t: "Failure of Operation Muromets"
monsocukr.8.d: "Despite our best attempts, our convert efforts to get Romanian to hand over Bessarabia peacefully, also known as Operation Muromets, has failed. Despite having no direct evidence to link our government to the various terrorist attacks and cells that formed as a result of our actions, the Romanian government clearly seems to know it was us, and has issued a stern 'warning' that any attempts to restore order within Bessarabia by our troops would be seen as an act of war. While the Operation was clearly a failure, that doesn't mean we can't capitalize on the chaos that reigns in Bessarabia to quickly seize it from Romania will a small war. Regardless, the operation was a failure, and the only remaining avenue to capture the land is by war, if that war comes sooner or later remains to be seen however."
monsocukr.8.a: "Death to Romania! We march for Greater Ukraine!"
monsocukr.8.b: "They've won this round, we'll be back..."

monsocukr.9.t: "An Offer from the South"
monsocukr.9.d: "Much like ourselves, the government of Ukraine has recently taken a great leap forward, emerging as a predominant People’s Government under the watchful eye of their King. Just like us, they have fallen adrift in a sea of conflicting ideologies and movements, however unlike when we first took up the mantle of the King and the People, a grouping of like minded nations exists, that of course being us and our Union of People’s Crowns. Seeking to latch onto a nation that shares ideals, the Ukrainian Government has formally petitioned to join the Union of People’s Crowns. Promising access to their vast grain resources, the Ukrainian delegation has promised that there is nothing to lose by granting them membership in the Union. Despite this, many wonder if they have alternative motives in this request, thus bringing their motivation for  joining into question."
monsocukr.9.a: "Of course! Long live the People’s Crowns!"
monsocukr.9.b: "What has Ukraine ever done for us? Rejected!"

monsocukr.10.t: "A Disappointing Response"
monsocukr.10.d: "Much to our disappointment, the People’s Government of White Ruthenia has denined our request to join the Union of People’s Crowns. While unexpected, this is expected to have little effect on the nation overall. Despite this, we once again find ourselves alone, with our backs to the wall. May God protect the Union, for we cannot."
monsocukr.10.a: "A setback for sure, but one we can recover from."

monsocukr.11.t: "The East Ablaze" 
monsocukr.11.d: "As predicted, the Russians and Russophiles who inhabit the east of our nation have not taken kindly to our efforts to remove their perfidious influence. What started as a series of spontaneous protests against our anti-russian policies has turned into riots, and in the worst case, all out insurgency. While this violence has no chance of succeeding in anything more then property damage,  it is a sign of just how deep the Bear was able to sink it’s claws into our nation. The armed forces are already preparing a plan to pacify the East; Those who rebel will be given two choices, return home and accept the righteous of the King and the People’s Government, or be driven to Russia, where they can finally be united with the 'Motherland'. Those who resist even this most generous offer will face our full wrath, knowing what it means to face the People’s justice. Either way, by the time we are done, Ukraine shall finally be free of the Russian Bear, after so long a time."
monsocukr.11.a: "Resistance is futile."

In 1913 he was expelled from the university for participation in a student strike and was compelled to serve in the army as a private. During Weltkrieg he served at the front and was commissioned.\nIn 1919 he joined the Borotbysts, rising rapidly to the highest levels of the party. Hrynko differs from most of the Borotbysts in that he is not a revolutionary dreamer. Without party training or tradition, Hrynko is often regarded by the Borotbysts as a careerist, although he is generally respected for his integrity. "

UKR_Isaak_Mazepa_sec_sde_desc: "Isaak Mazepa was born into a petty bourgeois family of Cossack origin. His father ensured his son's education in the theological seminary in Chernihiv. After graduating from seminary, he enrolled at the Faculty of Natural Sciences at St. Petersburg University. In St. Petersburg fate brought him together with Mykola Porsh and Symon Petliura,. Soon he joined the USDRP, of which he later became one of the leaders.\n\nAfter the formation of the Ukrainian Central Rada, Isaak did much to develop the activities of Ukrainian parties and organizations in Yekaterinoslav province. During the Hetmanate, when the persecution of active Ukrainian movement members began in Yekaterinoslav, Mazepa, working in the provincial zemstvo council, tried to protect them. In October 1918, Mazepa was arrested for editing a social-democratic newspaper and soon was fired. With the formation of the Dyrektoria as the government of the UPR in exile, Mazepa went to Galicia, where he was elected to the Central Committee of the USDRP and became its secretary."
