###Bio###
POLITICS_PAVLO_SKOROPADSKYI_DESC: "Pavlo Skoropadskyi, opportunist, Cossack, military officer, descendant of Ukrainian nobility, but above all - he is Hetman, leader of Ukraine, whose power depends only on Soim and the King.\n\nTracing his lineage back to the hetman of the 18th century Zaporozhian Army, Skoropadskyi rose through the ranks of the tsar’s military in a flash. During the Ukrainian Revolution, Pavlo Skoropadskyi became the chief organizer of the specially created Ukrainian Army Corps and numerous Cossack volunteer detachments that sought to fight the pro-Bolshevik militias. An ardent opponent of socialism, Skoropadskyi, along with his capitalist, landowner and military allies, began a conspiracy against the Ukrainian People’s Republic before overthrowing it on April 29, 1918. This could not have been accomplished without the Kaiser’s help, and to repay him, Skoropadskyi soon found himself in deep military and economic ties with Germany.\n\nOnly King Vasyl, who in the eyes of the hetman is seen only as a compromise imposed by the Austrians, resists. Anything deemed contrary to the national interest is strictly forbidden and brutally persecuted. With the weakness and powerlessness of Soim, there is only a faint illusion of democracy in Ukraine, but hatred for the Hetman’s autocracy grows among the court and a conspiracy matures..."
POLITICS_VASYL_DESC: "Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen is known to many as King Vasyl Vyshyvanyi. By many he is regarded as a symbol of foreign dominance, imposed on Ukraine as a result of a compromise between Germany and Austria. However, the others know, that Vasyl is fascinated by Ukrainian culture, he writes and speaks Ukrainian, and there is not a single argument, except for his origin, that he is not worthy of the throne of Ukraine. Even before he became Vasyl Vyshyvanyi, he received the nickname \"The Red Prince\" for his desire to improve the living conditions of the poor Ukrainian population of Galicia. In fact, among the few legal parties of Ukraine sitting in the Soim, it is Vasyl who is being put faith on. However, with a stagnant economy, a dysfunctional bureaucracy, and most of all, tension with the influential Hetman and his SHD, Vasyl struggles to maintain authority."
POLITICS_LEO_STEFAN_DESC: "King Leo Stefan von Habsburg-Lothringen, while ethnically Austrian, has been raised in the Ukrainian culture. While to some, Leo’s ascension is indicative of compromise between the Reichspakt and Ukraine, many lament the continued dominance of Ukraine by foreigners. The real compromise, these dissidents claim, was between Germany and Austria, who are now united in support for Leo. Domestically much of Leo’s support comes from the powerful land-owning class who now control the Soim and who see the young king as little more than a puppet to illicit Austro-German support for their endeavours."
POLITICS_LEV_II_DESC: "Count Leo Stefan was born to the Habsburg-Lorraine family on June 12, 1928. Being groomed to potentially succeed to the throne of a Eastern European state, Leo ended up gaining a lot of knowledge and respect for Ukrainian customs. Eventually he would be raised to this position as Lev II once King Vasyl was killed by a communist, he now tries his best to represent Ukraine. This knowledge and actual attempt to help Ukraine was noticed by some socialists who wished to keep the stability of the crown yet bring forth leftist ideals. Being entangled within these ideals, Lev the II now reigns Ukraine as the People’s King, representing and supporting their struggles against those that would keep the peasantry, and wider Ukraine down."
POLITICS_DANIIL_I_DESC: "Danylo Skoropadskyi, son of the famous 'Hetman', has ascended to the Ukrainian throne. With the long power-struggle between the Hetman and the monarchy finally resolved, Ukraine breathes a sign of relief. Danylo however is quite rightly seen by many as little more than a puppet king, effectively allowing his father to the bulk of rulership while he himself acts as the front-man. Perhaps after Pavlo Skoropadskyi’s death will the young king finally be able to assert himself but for now the young king will do just as he is told."
POLITICS_BORIS_MARTOS_DESC: ""
POLITICS_MIKHAIL_BULGAKOV_DESC: "Mikhail Bulgakov, an ethnic Russian born in the Kyiv governate, was for much of his life known more so for his prolific writings and literary talents rather than politics. After finding himself heading up the russophile ViN organisation, he is now in charge of the government and has made his intentions clear that the so-called 'Free State of Ukraine' is little more than a temporary fixture until the nation can be annexed into the motherland once more."
POLITICS_DMITRI_DONTSOV_DESC: "Dmytro Dontsov has been are the forefront of Ukrainian nationalism for many years and has solidified his position as the primary nationalist ideologue in Ukraine. Having allied with Konovalets and his UVO, Dontsov has become powerful during the interwar and now finally ascended to a position of leadership with his intentions of driving out both German and Russian influences as well as a general crackdown against socialist activity."
POLITICS_YEVHEN_KONOVALETS_DESC: "Yevhen Konovalets is the recognizable leader of the Ukrainian nationalist movement and its prime military-political organization, the UVO. His biography is the history of Ukrainian Independence, its struggle for national identity and sovereignity.\n\nBorn in the village near Lemberg, Austria-Hungary, Konovalets was always connected to the Ukrainian national movement. In the pre-Weltkrieg years he became an active member of the Prosvita becoming the secretary of the Lemberg Department, the Ukrainian educational association, In 1913 he met Dmytro Dontsov and became greatly influenced by the nationalist ideology and rhetoric. \n\nConscripted to the Austro-Hungarian Army during the war, he became prisoner-of-war in Russia, where he joined a group of former Galician officers together with Andrii Melnyk, eventually fleeing to Kyiv together. Serving for the independent Ukrainian Republic, he organized the division of Sich Striltsi and later assumed its command, effectively suppressing the Bolshevik uprising in Kyiv and resisting the Communist offensive.\n\nHe soon became the Colonel of Army and the Sich Striltsi regiment of Konovalets were considered one of the most combat-ready units of the Ukrainian army.\n\nEverything changed when the Hetmanate has risen. The regiment was disarmed and disbanded at the request of German command only to Konovalets receiving permission from Hetman Skoropadskyi to form a separate detachment of Sich Striltsi as part of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian state in Bila Tserkva a few months later. The command of the created unit was opposed to the Hetman, but remained faithful to the oath given to the Hetman.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Konovalets, together with Andrii Melnyk and Dmytro Dontsov formed the UVO - a nationalistic organisation, which proclaimed its goal to create a conciliar independent Ukrainian state on ethnic Ukrainian lands with a supreme leader, Konovalets, as its head."
POLITICS_VYACHESLAV_LYPYNSKY_DESC: "Vyacheslav Lypynskyi is known to be the main ideologue of the new Ukrainian statehood, the Hetman Movement, the Ukrainian Conservatism, or as he called it himself, the 'theory of Ukrainian Hetman Nationalism'. Despite this, he is a staunch critic of the Hetmanate, as he confronts Skoropadskyi’s desire to become the absolute monarch of Ukraine, as well as he sharply criticizes the radical 'integral nationalism' of Dontsov.\n\nBeing leader of the USKhD, a party once created to support the Hetman, Lypynskyi is soon to find himself among the other oppositional parties and main enemies of the Hetmanate regime."
POLITICS_ANDRIY_MELNYK_DESC: "Andriy Melnyk, colonel of the Army of the Ukrainian People’s Republic, one of the closest associates of Yevhen Konovalets, as well as one of the organizers of the Ukrainian Military Organization. Since the late 1920s, by order of Konovalets, he was in Galicia, where he represented the UVO, engaged in propaganda of Ukrainian nationalism and distributed anti-Austrian and anti-Polish leaflets.\n\nA staunch nationalist, proponent of the Ukrainian Natiocracy, Melnyk is seen as less radical than Dontsov and Konovalets, focusing more on militarism and centralisation, than on fierce radical nationalism."
POLITICS_DMYTRO_DOROSHENKO_DESC: "For Hetman - Doroshenko is a loyal subject, for nationalists - a liberal, and for the Central Committee of the UPR in exile - he is a traitor. \n\nOnce a member of the UPSF, shortly after Hetman Skoropadskyi came to power, Doroshenko became one of the leaders of the Hetman movement, Minister of Foreign Affairs and the main representative of the interests of the national democratic forces. Having created the USKhD together with Lypynskyi, Doroshenko was expelled from the party by the end of the 1920s. This was due to the ideological split between Lypynskyi and the Hetman. Doroshenko re-established the UPSF, as the left wing of the party renamed itself to the PULD(s-f), and remained one of the few supporters of Skoropadskyi, although he held more democratic views. Perhaps one day, he will be able to implement them without conflicting with the interests of the Hetman."
POLITICS_DMYTRO_LEVYTSKY_DESC: "Dmytro Levytskyi was born in the Lemberg region of Austria-Hungary, in 1877. He completed law school at the University of Vienna and during Weltkrieg served as an officer in the army of Austria-Hungary. Captured by the Russians in 1915, he spent the remainder of the war in Tashkent. Returning to Ukraine as the Russian Empire fell apart, Levytskyi hoped that the Austria-Hungary will fell, finally allowing for the West Ukrainians to unite with the rest of the country. Unfortunately, it did not happen. Forced to exile, as many democratic leaders, Levytskyi soon established the UNDO together with Mikhnovskyi, becoming his only ally.\n\nNow, when the UNDO finally stays triumphant in the mainland Ukraine, Levytskyi will do all his best to create a constitutional democratic republic with strong national identity."
POLITICS_MYKOLA_MIKHHNOVSKY_DESC: "'Mykola Mikhnovskyi is a Ukrainian elemental force,... which is restrained only by a strong and noble mind. He was a highly educated and experienced lawyer, a subtle psychologist, a successful initiator, an outstanding organizer, a brilliant speaker, a talented publicist, an intelligent and tactful leader, an intuitive military commander, an excellent connoisseur of our past, our history and everyday life, a typical revolutionary, that is, a person capable of decisive action. Brought up in good Ukrainian traditions, raised in a Ukrainian village, Mykola Mikhnovskyi was a model of Ukrainian racial culture, a Ukrainian aristocrat in all meanings of this concept.' - is the most flattering description of Mykola Mikhnovskyi.\n\nIn fact, the reality is somewhat different. All his life Mikhnovskyi defended ideas that were not supported by the majority. He has gained a strong reputation as a complex person with whom it is difficult to communicate. Extreme demands narrowed the circle of his friends: only those who shared his views became close.\n\nAn opponent of the policy of the Central Rada, a supporter of Skoropadskyi’s coup, Mikhnovskyi, unfortunately, turned out to be on the other side of the barricades against his will.\n\nDespite the negative reviews, the Hetman seriously considered Mikhnovskyi as a candidate for the post of Prime Minister of the Ukrainian State. He was impressed by anti-socialist views and his recognition of the right of peasants to private ownership of land. However, Pavlo Skoropadskyi was eventually persuaded not to appoint Mikhnovskyi as prime minister, and he offered him the position of his personal adviser. The ambitious Mikhnovskyi, of course, refused this, which foretold his future fate.\n\nMykola Mikhnovskyi made a lot of efforts to transform the Hetman’s political regime into a truly popular Ukrainian government. He was the author of a series of documents criticizing the composition of the government and its policies, subordinated directly to the Hetman. Mikhnovskyi was part of the delegations that appealed to the German occupation authorities. Not trusting the socialists, Mikhnovskyi did not support the idea of a mass anti-Hetman uprising. In the end, all his attempts led to the fact that he was expelled from Ukraine to Kuban, where he became a professor in Katerynodar Cooperative University, without losing hope of returning to Kyiv."
POLITICS_SERHIY_YEFREMOV_DESC: "Serhiy Yefremov was born into a priestly family and studied at the Kyiv Theological Seminary, which, however, did not prevent him from engaging in active political and educational activities. In 1911 he became one of the 82 famous writers and public figures who signed the protest \"to the Russian society about the bloody slander of the Jews\" published in connection with the \"case of Beilis\" Having become a staunch opponent of xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and Ukrainophobia, he was repeatedly arrested by the imperial authorities. It was he who suggested the use of the name Ukrainian People’s Republic for the state that emerged in Kyiv and thus became the \"godfather\" of the UNR.\n\nIn September 1917 he headed the Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists.\nAfter Skoropadskyi came to power, he criticized him and perceived it as usurpation of power and revenge of pre-revolutionary reaction. He was soon forced to flee to Galicia, where he joined the Dyrektoria and became one of its prominent right-wing leaders.\n\nNow in power, the Socialist-Federalists would finally be able to pursue their policy, liberal and moderate, despite the name, which was rather a tribute to the times."
POLITICS_ANDRIY_NIKOVSKY_DESC: "Andriy Nikovskyi came from a family of peasants and petty bourgeoisie in Kherson province. He studied at the University of Novorossiysk, first at the Natural Sciences Department, then at the Slavonic-Russian Department of History and Philology. After graduation, he worked for one year as a teacher of Russian language and literature, but soon left for Kyiv to work as an editor of the newspaper \"Rada\". He was also the secretary of the \"Prosvita\" in Odessa.\n\nAfter the Hetman came to power, he participated in the creation of the Ukrainian National Union, which was preparing a coup against Skoropadskyi and became its first head. However, in September he was replaced by Volodymyr Vynnychenko, after which the UNS turned into the Dyrektoria.\n\nNikovskyi collaborated with Serhiy Yefremov and worked with him in the Kyiv newspaper Rada. In exile in Galicia he became one of the leaders of the PULD(s-f)."
POLITICS_VSEVOLOD_HOLUBOVYCH_DESC: "The youngest Ukrainian prime minister in history became head of government shortly before his 33rd birthday. Fellow politicians did not speak of him in the best words. A Scoundrel is a common word addressed to the Ukrainian Prime Minister in 1918.\n\nHe was no stranger to politics. He participated in the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party and even received administrative penalties in 1905.\n\nSince 1912 he joined the circle of Ukrainian SRs. In 1915 he went to work for the railroad. In 1916, he moved to the position of head of the department of water, highway and dirt roads of the Romanian Front. There he built roads for the military. Probably, at this time he was not up to political pursuits.\n\nThe revolution of 1917 opened up new opportunities. He was eagerly invited to join the revived Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries. More and more often he was seen at pro–Ukrainian events in the city - rallies and meetings. He created an Odesa department of the UPSR amongst the railway workers of the Odesa railway network and soon was elected as the head of the Odesa City Council. Quickly rising in ranks, Holubovych soon found himself as the head of Ukrainian Government after the poor management of the Vynnychenko’s government. He also headed the Ukrainian delegation to Brest-Litovsk, after which he returned triumphant, but soon became the main culprit of the Austro-German occupation of Ukraine and a German-backed coup of Hetman Skoropadskyi. On April 29, 1918, he was arrested by the Germans for his participation in the kidnapping of the pro-German banker A. Dobry. In 1919, a German military court sentenced Holubovych to 2 years in prison.\n\nAfter his release in 1921 he left Ukraine for Galicia, where he joined the Dyrektoria. However, his reputation stayed with him, despite his prison sentence, and if elected once again, it is likely that much pressure and suspicion would be put on him."
POLITICS_LEVKO_KOVALIV_DESC: "Levko Kovaliv became one of the leaders of the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries and member of the Central Committee of the party in 1917. In 1918, together with Oleksandr Shumskyi, Panas Liubchenko and others, he joined the left fraction of the party, which soon became known as Borotbysts. During the Hetmanate, he headed the work of underground counter-intelligence. The struggle of the revolutionary forces against the Hetman's power was a significant destabilizing force, which hindered Hetmanate's ability to act according to their own plans. Unfortunately, not a single political party was able to organize a large-scale anti-Hetman uprising at that time due to the lack of an all-Ukrainian revolutionary and political center. Borotbysts failed to take the peasant uprising into their own hands. Soon enough all socialist-minded politicians in Ukraine were forced to exile by the Skoropadskyi’s Derzhavna Varta and German forces.\n\nIn emigration, he diverged in views with Oleksandr Shumskyi, leader of the Borotbysts, who refused cooperation with other socialist parties and insisted on continuing the revolutionary struggle against the Hetman regime. Instead, Kovaliv, believed that cooperation with other socialist parties is a necessary step to overthrow the Hetman. On this basis, he returned to the UPSR, where he headed the left faction and promoted pro-Borotbyst views among the party members.\n\nNow, elected as party head, there are even fewer contradictions between the two parties and their unification is closer than ever."
POLITICS_MYKOLA_KOVALEVSKYI_DESC: "Mykola Kovalevskyi joined the Kyiv Committee of Ukrainian SRs in 1914. He co-authored the project of the party program, participated in the preparation of a protest demonstration against the Tsar's ban on celebrating the 100th anniversary of T. Shevchenko's birthday and later worked in a cooperative in Poltava.\n\nIn 1917 he became an active participant in Ukrainian revolution - as a member of the Ukrainian Central Rada and member of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Selianska Spilka. He also served as the Minister of Land Affairs\n\nIn 1920 he was forced into emigration. At first he lived in Vienna, but soon moved to Galicia in order to join Dyrektoria, where he became the most likely candidate for the Minister of Land Affairs.\n\nNow, elected as the new Prime Minister, Kovalevskyi will focus on the final resolution of the land issue in Ukraine."
POLITICS_PAVLO_KHRISTIUK_DESC: "Born in a Kuban Cossack family, Pavlo Khristiuk, has become actively involved in political life when he was just 22. He became a proponent of Ukrainian cultural development and tried his best to achieve it as far as possible. Among others, he signed a letter addressed to a member of the Russian Imperial State Duma, which reflected the well-founded anxiety of the Ukrainian intelligentsia, caused by constant and purposeful Russification policy of the tsarist government.\nLater joining the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party, he became a leading member of its Central Committee and the Selianska Spilka and a minister of internal affairs in the government of Vsevolod Holubovych in 1918.\n\nIn 1919, among other Ukrainian SR members, he emigrated to Vienna, where he stayed for some time and worker as an co-editor of the 'Boritesia - Poborete' magazine. He later went to Lviv, where he actively hepled the local cooperative movement, combining it with his work in the Dyrektoria.\n\nNow, elected as the Ukrainian head of state, Khristiuk is willing to make Ukraine a truly people's republic with strong national identity and healthy and happy nation."
POLITICS_MYKYTA_SHAPOVAL_DESC: "Mykyta Shapoval is not just a politician. Known as a publicist, sociologist, a poet, and even as a forester by his profession, Shapoval became one of the leaders of the 'centrist faction' in the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary party in exile. Unlike the other Dyrektoria members, he spent much of the recent years in Prague, where he became well-known as an organizer of the All-Ukrainian Workers' Union of Bohemia, co-creator of Ukrainian higher schools in Prague and head of the Ukrainian Sociological Institute in Prague, thanks to the support of T.Masaryk.\n\nIn his own party he is well known to be a socialist demagogue and a populist. Whether his 'presidency' will show any tangible results is yet to be seen."
POLITICS_MYKHAILO_HRUSHEVSKYI_DESC: "On November 7, 1918, the chairman of the Ukrainian Central Rada, Mykhailo Hrushevskyi, has proclaimed the Ukrainian People's Republic...\n\nJust a few months before, a well-known Ukrainian historian, author of the ten-volume monograph \"History of Ukraine-Rus\", which caused a great deal of acute scientific disputes and demagoguery, Mykhailo Hrushevskyi had been elected the chairman of Rada.\nHrushevskyi, a liberal democrat before the Revolution, soon made the Ukrainian SRs his main support and began to fulfill the cardinal political task of his movement - the formation of national statehood, initially in the form of national—territorial autonomy of Ukraine in Russia, which was later supposed to be transformed into a treaty federation. However, everything changed soon - or even too soon. With the Bolshevik revolution in Russia - Ukraine first declared its independence, just to became a German protectorate a few months later.\n\nIn 1919 Hrushevskyi left for Austria and established Ukrainian Sociological Institute in Vienna, distancing himself from the Dyrektoria's political intrigues. Nevertheless, he stayed as an active member of the Ukrainian SR Party, and with People's Republics flags waving over Kyiv, he was invited to lead the Ukrainian government once again."
POLITICS_CENTRAL_RADA_DESC: "Ukrainian Law says that if the office of the Prime-Minister is vacant, the Ukrainian Parliament becomes a collective executive institution until the new government is appointed."
POLITICS_YEVHEN_PETRUSHEVYCH_DESC: "Yevhen Petrushevych is a real mastodon in Western Ukrainian politics. He was a talented organizer of socio-political and cultural-educational life in Eastern Galicia, chairman of the district "Prosvita" and a fighter against "Muscovophilia", widespread in the Sokal region in those years. He won the favor of the broad masses by his professional defense against the arbitrariness of the authorities as a lawyer.\nIn the first elections to the Austrian parliament in 1907 he became ambassador for a large constituency in Eastern Galicia. Among the 30 Ukrainian deputies he became one of the leaders, the chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary representation, whose speeches at the sessions were distinguished by purposefulness and deep argumentation. He did not hesitate to criticize the policy of the Austrian government in the national question and insistently demanded reforms, first of all in the electoral sphere. Thanks to Petrushevych’s activities, Ukrainians became more involved in leadership positions in local and regional institutions, and he even achieved the appointment of Ukrainians to leadership positions in the Austrian government. \n\nTogether with parliamentarians from the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Petrushevych worked out and submitted to Emperor Charles a plan for restructuring the Austro-Hungarian Empire, transforming it into a federation of free nations with the prospect of forming national states in alliance with Austria, which soon happened, though partially.\nDuring the last 16 years after the war, Petrushevych achieved the creation of the Ukrainian Galician Army as a unit of the Austrian armed forces, as well as the favor of the emperor on the issue of the UNR government in exile in Galicia. However, the Ukrainians never received the promise of broad autonomy, which significantly undermined confidence in the Austrians.\n\nNow, having proclaimed the sovereignty of the Western Ukrainian People’s Republic, there is no doubt that, under Petrushevych’s leadership, these lands will finally reunite with their brothers in Kyiv."

POLITICS_SYMON_PETLIURA_DESC: "A native of Poltava, Symon Petliura, is known as an impulsive person, prone to noisy effects, yet pragmatic and rational. A member of USDRP, rather socialist-minded politician became the first military minister of the Ukrainian People’s Republic, the creator of the first national armed forces of Ukraine. Unlike his fellow party member Vynnychenko, Petliura believed that only a professional regular army will help to win Ukrainian independence. With his special regiment of Haidamaks, Petliura played a major role in suppressing the 'Arsenal' industrial plant and liquidation of last remnants of Bolshevik uprising.\n\nAfter the Hetman’s Coup, Petliura together with other social-democrats began to establish shadow structures of opposition across the country, preparing an armed uprising against Skoropadskyi. But as most socialist leaders were arrested or exiled, the uprising never happened and Petliura was forced to flee to Galicia-Lodomeria.\n\nBeing one of the leaders of the exiled forces, Petliura patiently waits for the right moment for a coup. But should the socialists once again turn against Ukrainians, Petliura can use his connections in the army for his own good."
POLITICS_ISAAK_MAZEPA_DESC: "Isaak Mazepa was born into a petty bourgeois family of Cossack origin. His father ensured his son's education in the theological seminary in Chernihiv. After graduating from seminary, he enrolled at the Faculty of Natural Sciences at St. Petersburg University. In St. Petersburg fate brought him together with Mykola Porsh and Symon Petliura,. Soon he joined the USDRP, of which he later became one of the leaders.\n\nAfter the formation of the Ukrainian Central Rada, Isaak did much to develop the activities of Ukrainian parties and organizations in Yekaterinoslav province. During the Hetmanate, when the persecution of active Ukrainian movement members began in Yekaterinoslav, Mazepa, working in the provincial zemstvo council, tried to protect them. In October 1918, Mazepa was arrested for editing a social-democratic newspaper and soon was fired. With the formation of the Dyrektoria as the government of the UPR in exile, Mazepa went to Galicia, where he was elected to the Central Committee of the USDRP and became its secretary. \n\nAfter Otoman Petliura's coup, he joined the Ukrainian National Union, which he created, where, along with Mykyta Shapoval, he led a leftist faction. Now at the head of the country, Mazepa was ready to change the country further in the vein of socialist democracy."
POLITICS_VOLODYMYR_VYNNYCHENKO_DESC: "Volodymyr Vynnychenko is considered by many as a founding father of Ukrainian statehood, together with Mykhailo Hrushevskyi. An author of almost all official declarations and legislation of the Ukrainian People’s Republic, he also became the first prime-minister of this formally sovereign short-lived state.\n\nAfter the Hetman’s Coup, he was arrested by the new government for trumped-up charges. in the preparation of a coup d'etat. However, the German administration pressured Skoropadskyi to liberate him, frightened by the possibility of political destabilisation. He became the leader of the alliance of Ukrainian socialist parties, planning to organize an armed uprising against Skoropadskyi’s dictatorship with the help of Russian Bolsheviks. However, his plans were doomed to failure, and, miraculously avoiding another arrest, together with other former UPR leaders, Vynnychenko fled to Galicia and headed the UPR government in exile.\n\nAlong with Symon Petliura, he is one of the leaders of the upcoming uprising against the Hetman regime, but will he be able to hold off another attempt to create a socialist republic in Ukraine?"
POLITICS_VASYL_SHAKHRAI_DESC: "Called a \"national communist\" by his rivals, he is one of the main communist theorists of the Ukrainian national struggle. Speaking out against both nationalism and capitalism, Shakhrai fights for workers' power in Ukraine, unconstrained by imperialism and opportunistic compromises. Having a friendly relationship with Shumskyi, Shakhrai is the only person who can unite the left flank of Ukrainian politics."

POLITICS_IVAN_MAISTRENKO_DESC: "Born in 1899 in the small Ukrainian town of Opyshnya, Poltava region, Ivan Maistrenko, dreaming of a Ukraine without tsarism and exploitation, actively participated in anti-Tsarist student societies, having his first experience of organizing and illegal work. This experience came in handy when the revolution began.\nJoining the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries in 1917, the young Maistrenko became firmly associated with its radical left wing, soon to be called \"Borotba\". \n\nWhen the Germans came, he fought with small units of the UNR army and Borotba partisans against the Hetman government until he became disillusioned with the possibility of a popular uprising against the Hetman government, as the German army suppressed any dissatisfied leftist forces and peasant uprisings. He made a difficult decision and moved to Galicia, a Ukrainian region, to continue the struggle in another way.\n\nSeeing the unwillingness of the policy of the Dyrektoria to organize effective political agitation in Austrian Ukraine and not supporting the right-wing and authoritarian tendencies of Petrushevych, Maistrenko and a small group of Borotbysts and Communists, joined by the left-liberal Ivan Bahrianyi and the democratic nationalist group of Petro Poltava, set out to create a strong Ukrainian leftist party that would promote Ukrainian politics in Galicia as well as in central Ukraine with the goal of uniting it into a prosperous and democratic state\n\nHowever, the creation of such a party was by no means smooth. From its inception, the URDP was split almost in half by the left wing of Maistrenko and the right wing of Bagryanyi, who worked side by side as autonomous groups, in a party that was more like an electoral coalition than a unified political entity. \n\nRepresenting the left wing of the URDP, Maistrenko was editor of the socialist magazine Vpered, where he advocated a socialist system based on market redistribution rather than central planning. While writing that the market was necessary to guard against authoritarianism, he still insisted on full socialization of the means of production and strict regulation to create a just, socialist, and democratic society for Ukraine.\n\nWith his wing of the URDP in power, Maistrenko would do anything to move Ukraine toward his vision of a truly socialist, unified, democratic republic..."
POLITICS_OLEKSANDER_SHUMSKYI_DESC: "Oleksander Shumskyi is regarded by many as the last hope for Ukrainian socialists. A former member of the Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries, a revolutionary, he soon became the leader of the radical left-wing of the UPSR, who advocated radical views on social and agrarian matters, similar to those of the Bolsheviks and Russian Left SRs.\n\nAfter the coup, Shumskyi defended the course to unfold the struggle against Hetmanate, rapprochement with Bolsheviks, establishing a Soviet Ukrainian state with active Ukrainisation. Among the Central Committee of the Borotbysts, he was the only practical man, rather than a romanticist. However, the Bolsheviks have been defeated both in Russia and Ukraine, and Shumskyi, together with the newly created party of Borotbysts, began his active work to destroy the Hetmanate from inside and liberate the Ukrainian peasants and workers."
POLITICS_VASYL_BLAKYTNYI_DESC: "Vasyl Blakytnyi was born into the family of the parish priest in the small village in Chernihiv Province. After graduating from a theological seminary, he attended the Commercial Institute in Kyiv. While still a student he took an active part in revolutionary life, later joining the Kyiv organization of Ukrainian SR’s. Before 1917 Blakytnyi was in charge of the revolutionary youth movement. During the Revolution he was active in the UPSR in Chernihiv Province. At the Fourth Congress of the UPSR (May 1918) he was elected in absentia to the Borotbyst-controlled Central Committee. Imprisoned for several months under the Hetmanate, he was released due to the German mediation as a part of campaign to 'calm down' Ukraine. He than became an editor of 'Borotba' newspaper. Under his editorship, 'Borotba' enjoyed great popularity not only among Ukrainians abroad but also in Ukraine.\n\nIn spite of his delicate constitution, Blakytnyi has the tenacity and endurance required for political work. He is a good diplomat and orator, a talented poet, a devoted underground worker and a Ukrainian patriot. Elected as the new Premier of Ukraine, he will definetely ensure its development with \"Strokes of Hammer and Heart\""
POLITICS_PANAS_LYUBCHENKO_DESC: "A good orator and organizer, Panas Lyubchenko was a born politician, cool and resourceful. A product of Borotbyst party schooling, he belongs to the younger generation of the Borotbyst elite. His lack of education in the humanities placed him at a disadvantage in the highest Borotbyst circles. As a Borotbyst, he worked in the underground against the Hetmanate regime. Later, he became the member of the Central Committee of the party and directly participated in the Borobyst Revolution. Now, elected as the premier of the Main Council of Revolutionary Emissaries, he will lead Ukraine to a brighter future."
POLITICS_MYKOLA_STSIBORSKYI_DESC: "Mykola Stsiborskyi is an interesting figure in the Ukrainian political scene. A veteran of the Weltkrieg and Russian Civil War, captain in the cavalry of the UPR army, he has a revolutionary temperament and true patriotic feelings for his Motherland.\n\nStsiborskyi supported Skoropadskyi’s coup and managed to build a brilliant military career.

A staunch Bolshevik and influential party member, he has strong ties with the RKP, advocating more cooperation between the two parties.

After the creation of the Third Internationale, he was often on mission in France, where he was strongly concerned about the question of the colonies and the struggle against world imperialism. However, in his view, the Communards could not offer an effective solution to this problem, as a result of which Richytskyi became a harsh critic of the \"social-chauvinism\" of European countries and the \"national-syndicalism\" of the liberation fronts. He leads the Ukapist left wing, and is determined to lead a worldwide anti-colonial struggle.\n\n\"As the struggle of the middle peasantry against the landlords and capitalists is used for the proletarian revolution, so the national struggle of the colonies and oppressed peoples must be used for the same purposes, as the middle peasantry gains land from the revolution, so the colonies must gain independence\""

In 1918 he joined the Bolshevik party and headed the detachment of the Red Guard in Yuzivka, but because of his low fame he managed to avoid arrest and stayed alive. Trying to find work in postwar Russia, Khrushchev went to Moscow to work, where he was able to settle as a petty party agitator in the service of Bukharin.  But Khrushchev's real dream always remained the field and the vegetables grown on it.\n\nSoon after the Socialists came to power in Russia and the revolution in Ukraine, the activities of the so-called KP(b)U, the Communist Party of the Bolsheviks of Ukraine, mostly composed of Russians like Khrushchev himself, intensified.

In contrast to civil war-torn Russia, Ukraine was securely protected by Austro-Hungarian and German bayonets and was a real oasis of tranquility, which attracted a great number of officers of the former Tsarist army who formed officer volunteer detachments with a very skeptical, and sometimes hostile, attitude toward Ukrainian statehood. It was only by the end of the 1920s that Hetman managed to establish conscription, open an officers' academy and achieve minimal Ukrainianization of the armed forces.

 UKR_USDRP_party_desc: "The §MUSDRP§! brings together many politicians under the banners of Marxism and Social Democracy. However, many of them have very different views on certain political issues.\n\nThe so-called §MCenter§! of the Party, the strongest political faction in the USDRP, is a group that largely follows the ideals of Kautsky’s orthodox Social Democracy and the Erfurt Program. The centrist-Marxist faction will try to hold the party together and promote the vision of a Democratic Socialist Republic, one of universal democracy, in both politics and economics.\n\nThe §RLeft§! in the USDRP is a faction that adheres to the ideas of Soviet democracy and Soviet communism. Rejecting the idea of a party-dominated §NUkapist§! state, they want to transfer all power to local councils. The commitment to Soviet democracy of this wing of the party makes the basic divergence from the §NUKP§! irrelevant, pushing for the elimination of the schism...\n\nThe §lRight§! wing of the USDPR believes that Ukraine is not ready for socialism - in their view, socialism is only possible in developed countries with an educated and politically strong working class. This framework forces the right to unite with bourgeois parties such as the §lPULD(s-f)§! to develop production and implement a successful capitalist modernization that will lead to socialism. They will work with business and at the same time help the working class gain the political consciousness to prepare for the long and evolutionary road to a socialist society.\n\n§YWhich wing dominates the party will determine our ideology and policy.§!\nThe §MUSDRP§! is currently: [GetUSDRPPoliticalStatus]"

#Петлюра-Мельник — самый стабильный путь, он дает игроку войска сечевых стрельцов, бонусы к армии, 
#и строит такой себе соцдем корпоративистский хунта режим; демократический путь будет путем, где Петлюра 
#выганяет всех радикальнвх левых с власти, проводит чистки в партиях и объединяется с буржуазными партиями. 
#Самый нестабильный путь, и в конце этого пути нацсоюз может расколоться и скинуть петлюру, или же петлюра 
#введет демократию или же введет псевдодемократию и станет вечным президентом; 
#левый путь будет попыткой договориться абсолютно разные личности — Шумского и Петлюру под предлогом 
#экстраординарной ситуации. По сути, весь путь будет борьба за власть двоих и исторически 
#будет похожа на союз гоминьдана и коммунистов

#Также придумал механику, по сути, так как власть супер нестабильная, 
#то все ветки будут перетягиванием каната, где пока петлюра не закрепится, его могут переиграть

#Также при перевороте петлюры думаю что параллельно должно начаться восстание боротьбистов, 
#которые совсем петлюру не принимают, но так как страна в хаосе, они изначально не в 
#состлянии войны один с другим. И если идти по левой ветке, 
#то это как раз будет попытка достичь с ними компромисса, который возможен только 
#если Петлюра максимально ляжет под левых, по сути. В остальных двух путях боротьбистов придется подавить

#Если в эту всю херню вмешается Германия, то между боротьбистами и Петлюрой тоже возможен временный союз.

### New Events ###
ukrpol.1.t: "Our Kingdom"
ukrpol.1.d: "The Ukrainian State declared its independence with the support of Germany on April 28, 1918, when, as a result of a coup against the left-leaning Central Rada, the initial experiment with socialism in the form of a People’s Republic was canceled. Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, a strong-willed man and a former general of the Russian army, who set the tone for the future of Ukraine, came to power. This state of affairs was soon ratified by the Brest-Litovsk peace agreement.\n\nUkraine was to become a breadbasket used by the military aristocratic elite from all over Eastern Europe as a source of food, a convenient market for goods and a military bulwark against the weakened Russian Republic. Skoropadskyi relied on large landowners, the old bureaucracy and officers and sought to build a new Ukrainian monarchy with himself at the head. The leaders of the People’s Republic were expelled from the country, and their parties were banned, but they were able to establish a government in exile in neighboring Galicia-Lodomeria, where a significant part of Ukrainians lived.\n\nHowever, German aid soon turned into payment of informal debts to the allies for the Hetman. For some time, the dispute between Germany and its Austro-Hungarian ally continued after the Weltkrieg, eventually settling on a compromise according to which King Vasyl, the Austrian Archduke Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, would rule with the support of Skoropadskyi, who, as a German-allied \"Hetman\", has incredible powers both in civil and military matters. In fact, the Hetman still remained practically the sole ruler of Ukraine, limited only by the King and the Soim, which is increasingly dissatisfied with Skoropadskyi’s policy.\n\nNow, almost twenty years after the Weltkrieg, the situation in the country is unstable. The Reich forces us to sell our goods almost exclusively to countries within its sphere of influence, while syndicalists are gaining popularity every day among the oppressed rural poor and urban workers. Despite these many problems we face, our land is prosperous and fertile, our people are hardworking, and our potential is limitless."
ukrpol.1.a: "Shche Ne Vmerla Ukraina!"

ukrpol.2.t: "The Hetman"
ukrpol.2.d: "The role of the Hetman of Ukraine - the permanent Pavlo Skoropadskyi in domestic and foreign policy is very great. He is the supreme head of the state, the army and the judiciary. State administration was carried out by the Government appointed by him. Pavlo Skoropadskyi was proclaimed the guarantor of order and legality before the elections of the Ukrainian Soim. \n\nHowever, everything changed in 1927. As a result of the compromise of Germany with Austria-Hungary during the 1927 Ausgleich, the political system of the Hetmanate changed. Austrian Archduke Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, was crowned in Kyiv as King Vasyl, elections were held to the new Ukrainian Soim. As a result of all this, the Hetman’s power was limited, although he continued to be the supreme leader and commander-in-chief, and none of the decisions were made without his approval. The parties of the Soim that existed under strict control soon became quite oppositional and stopped seeing the Hetman as the only possible ruler of Ukraine. His desire for sole power rejected them and hindered the emerging ideology of Ukrainian monarchism and conservatism, which saw the Hetman as an exclusively symbolic figure.\n\nThe Hetman sees the future of Ukraine only in increasing his own power and turning the country into a real Hetmanate with himself at the head. And there would be practically no obstacles to this if it were not for the Soim and the King."
ukrpol.2.a: "Zghynut Nashi Vorohy, Yak Rosa Na Sontsi"

ukrpol.3.t: "The King"
ukrpol.3.d: "Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen is known to many as King Vasyl Vyshyvanyi. By many he is regarded as a symbol of foreign dominance, imposed on Ukraine as a result of a compromise between Germany and Austria. However, the others know, that Vasyl is fascinated by Ukrainian culture, he writes and speaks Ukrainian, and there is not a single argument, except for his origin, that he is not worthy of the throne of Ukraine. Even before he became Vasyl Vyshyvanyi, he received the nickname \"The Red Prince\" for his desire to improve the living conditions of the poor Ukrainian population of Galicia.\n\nFor almost 15 years, the Hetman of Ukraine has been doing everything to marginalize the King, and not giving him the opportunity to show his best side. Therefore, the only support and hope of Vasyl is Austria and the Ukrainian Soim. Of the several parties sitting there, Vasyl has long been an integral figure of the new Ukrainian Statehood. Having got rid of the Hetman, the authorities in the country will finally be able to rely on the ideas of Ukrainian Conservatism, maybe even allow Vasyl to throw off the foreign stigma of the \"King\" and become a real Hetman of Ukraine."
ukrpol.3.a: "Schob Vernuty Iyi Chest, Liazhem Holovamy"

ukrpol.300.t: "The Soim"
ukrpol.300.d: "The Ukrainian Soim, convened in 1927 shortly after the coronation of King Vasyl, was the hope not only of His Majesty, but also of the Ukrainian people for democratic change. However, the Hetman clung too tightly to his power. In fact, the Soim is only an advisory body, for the government is formed solely by the Hetman, and any bill can easily be rejected by him. This has allowed the political system of Ukraine to be mothballed.\n\nThere are three main parties in Soim, and many candidates from corporations and organizations, as well as non-partisans. The ruling party, the Union of Hetmantsiv-Derzhavnykiv (SHD or 'Derzhavnyks'), stands on firm pro-Hetman conservative positions and has Germanophile and Russophile wings, uniting mainly old tsarist ministers and landowners. The main opposition is a coalition of the Ukrainian Union of Khliborobs-Derzhavnyks (USKhD or 'Khliborobs'), which do not differ much ideologically from the SHD, but support a constitutional monarchy under King Vasyl and are generally more liberal-minded.\n\nThere are also other parties that are not represented in the parliament, but have all chances to return to politics in the next elections - Dontsov's nationalists, Konovalets's militarists, as well as Mikhnovskyi's UDKhP ('Democrats-Khliborobs')"
ukrpol.300.a: "Nazovemsia Ukrainy Virnymy Synamy!"

ukrpol.4.t: "Our Economy"
ukrpol.4.d: "The economy of Ukraine is predominantly agrarian. In 1918, Land commissions were established, including the Supreme Land Commission, chaired by Skoropadskyi, to resolve land disputes and develop a land reform project.\n\nA stable currency and tax system were established, the state budget was developed and executed, State and Land Banks were created. Private land ownership, including the one for the large landowners, was restored, the peasants' ownership of land was confirmed with the allocation and sale of communal lands, which contributed to the formation of a broad class of medium-sized landowners. However, the state grain monopoly imposed by the Germans remained. The Skoropadskyi’s government relied on the restoration of large landlords and middle peasant farms, in which the German-Austrian occupation authorities were also interested. Supporting the Hetman, the landlords declared that small peasant farms were not able to provide large-scale commercial production of agricultural products, as demanded by war-ravaged Germany and Austria-Hungary from Ukraine. The soon-established supplies of industrial goods and agricultural implements to Ukraine from these countries helped ease the tense political and socio-economic situation in Ukrainian society.\n\nBy 1936, Ukraine had become one of the most promising economies in Europe, receiving a lot of money and investments from European powers. Industrial enterprises were restored and new ones were gradually created. However, there is only one fear - what if Europe stops buying our bread?"
ukrpol.4.a: "I doubt they will stop."

ukrpol.5.t: "The King Opens The Session Of The Soim"
ukrpol.5.d: "The Christmas festivities are over, and today was the first meeting of the Soim after the New Year’s break. The session was opened in person by King Vasyl, who addressed parliament and announced the need for a new budget for the year. His speech was met with skepticism by the majority consisting of members of the ruling Hetman’s Party, the SHD. However, the King’s supporters, the USKhD, cheerfully applauded the King’s speech, hastening to assure that Ukraine will be even richer and more successful this year."
ukrpol.5.a: "As useless as it could be."

ukrpol.6.t: "Donbas General Strike"
ukrpol.6.d: "Workers and miners in the east of the country staged another strike today over wage cuts and dissatisfaction with the huge number of working hours. They demand indulgences and refuse to work until their demands are met. Despite the fact that strikes are officially banned, Derzhavna Varta does not yet dare to disperse the workers, awaiting instructions from the central government"
ukrpol.6.a: "Make minor concessions to them."
ukrpol.6.b: "Suppress the strikers!"
ukrpol.6.c: "Ignore them, we have more serious problems."

ukrpol.7.t: "Derzhavna Varta Reports to the Hetman"
ukrpol.7.d: "Derzhavna Warta presented its annual report for the past year to Hetman Skoropadskyi personally, noting its merits in the fight against sabotage and terrorism on the territory of the Kingdom. The situation was especially tense in Odesa, where, according to the head of the State Guard, organized crime and banditry were rampant. Funded, according to Getman, by both French syndicalists and Romanian legionnaires, the troubled region has been at the center of various scandals for years. Measures must be taken to eliminate crime as quickly as possible."
ukrpol.7.a: "We must strengthen our anti-terrorist measures"

ukrpol.8.t: "Prosvita Spreads Anti-Monarchist Appeals"
ukrpol.8.d: "The Prosvita, which originally appeared as the Ukrainian Enlightenment Society, from the years of the civil war fell into the hands of the socialists and syndicalists of the Dyrektoria and conducts its subversive activities on the territory of the Kingdom, mainly spreading anti-monarchist slogans. Until recently, their activities had little impact, but with the onset of the crisis, more and more people prefer to believe in any criticism of the regime, seeing in it the culprit of all their misfortunes."
ukrpol.8.a: "Prosvita shall not pass!"

ukrpol.9.t: "Kyiv German Garrison Recalled"
ukrpol.9.d: "The German command in Kyiv, known as the German Garrison, was withdrawn to Berlin as a result of Black Monday. For the first time since 1918 German troops, though no longer as numerous, left the country entirely.\n\nThere is already speculation as to what the political consequences of this decision will be, but in the absence of German control over Ukraine, anything can happen. In any case, the political forces have already begun to consolidate and prepare for anything."
ukrpol.9.a: "It’s time to act."

ukrpol.10.t: "Dualism"
ukrpol.10.d: "The Ukrainian political system, according to many, is imperfect. On the one hand, the Hetman is quite an influential figure with many powers, but on the other hand his ambitions are limited by Soim and the presence of the King. Hetman has long dreamed of returning to the days when his power over Ukraine was virtually unlimited, and his place was not occupied by an Austrian impostor.\n\nOn the other hand, the King and Soim’s opposition parties are dissatisfied with Hetman’s power and believe that his presence interferes with the normal functioning of parliament. In any case, it has often come to a conflict, and now is the best moment to settle the matter once and for all."
ukrpol.10.a: "Stand by the King"
ukrpol.10.b: "Stand by the Hetman"

### King's path to power ###
ukrpol.11.t: "In Search of Reliable Allies"
ukrpol.11.d: "In Ukraine, which has been almost completely cleansed of any political opposition, the Hetman regime is left with few rivals, and thus few potential allies.\n\nOn the one hand, our main ally in the parliament is Lypynskyi, the main ideologist of Ukrainian conservatism, who came into conflict with Hetman back in the mid-20’s and opposed his autocratic rule. Now he is not only the leader of the Soim opposition, but also the main critic of the regime and supporter of the king. An alliance with his party, the USHD, is probably the most favorable prospect for us.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also dissatisfied Hetman among the Ukrainian armed forces. In particular, this is the Ukrainian Military Organization under the leadership of Konovalets. At first disarmed by Hetman, the Sichi Striltsi detachments were soon restored and had a significant influence on the formation of the armed forces. However, Konovalets himself, who holds more nationalistic views than Hetman, hardly supports Hetman."
ukrpol.11.a: "Lypynskyi is reliable enough" #will lead to UVO joining the Direktoriia and death of Konovalets
ukrpol.11.b: "What can we do without Sich Striltsi?" #UVO will attempt countercoup

ukrpol.12.t: "The Royal Conspiracy"
ukrpol.12.d: "King Vasyl had long thought that the Hetman was only in the way. The political system in which he finds himself is completely devoid of any transparency or honesty, and Hetman does everything to ensure that neither the Parliament nor the King has any influence on important political decisions. This must come to an end. A conspiracy against Hetman is brewing. This man must not remain in power, otherwise Ukraine will be in distress. It is necessary to look for allies to solve the problem of imperfect Ukrainian politics."
ukrpol.12.a: "The Hetman should go or be forced to go!"

ukrpol.13.t: "UVO Activities in Galicia"
ukrpol.13.d.king: "After the Ukrainian Military Organization was established, one of Konovalets' main associates, Andriy Melnyk, was sent to Galicia, where he headed the local militarized units of Ukrainian Striltsi. Now that we have joined together in a conspiracy against the Hetman with Konovalets, he insists that Melnyk should return to Ukraine and help us in the rebellion."
ukrpol.13.d.hetman: "After the Ukrainian Military Organization was established, one of Konovalets' main associates, Andriy Melnyk, was sent to Galicia, where he headed the local militarized units of Ukrainian Striltsi. Now that Konovalets is cooperating with Soim and King, he insists that Melnyk should return to Ukraine, which makes us feel uncomfortable about true UVO's intentions."
ukrpol.13.a: "[ukrpol_13_a]"
ukrpol.13.king: "Melnyk would be useful in the upcoming events..."
ukrpol.13.hetman: "Wasn't he feeling good in Galicia?"

ukrpol.14.t: "Ukraine Seizes Polish Farms"
ukrpol.14.d: "We received information that the Ukrainian government has allowed requisition of Polish farms in West and Central Ukraine. Lobbied by the Ukraininan nationalists, they hopefully wanted to end the centuries-long Polish noblemen’s landholdings. However, they have just left our Polish brethren without any concessions. We should officially send a note of protest to the Ukrainian King!"
ukrpol.14.a: "How dare they?"

ukrpol.15.t: "Note of Protest From [FROM.GetName]"
ukrpol.15.d: "Upon learning of the requisitioning of Polish farms, the Polish government sent us a strong note of protest and expelled a couple of diplomats from their country. They demand that the nationalized property of citizens of Polish nationality be immediately returned to them or compensated. Perhaps we really overreacted and we should not spoil relations with the Poles, given that by doing so we might give them carte blanche to carry out similar repressions against Ukrainians on their territory."
ukrpol.15.a: "We should not risk our [FROM.GetAdjective] ally." #We can peacefully negotiate on Galicia later
ukrpol.15.b: "The domination of Shliakhta will end eventually." #Ukrainian-Polish relations will be destroyed

ukrpol.16.t: "Secret Rearmament in Bila Tserkva"
ukrpol.16.d: "In Bila Tserkva, the main stronghold of the Sichovi Striltsi and the location of the UVO headquarters, weapons were secretly delivered from the warehouses under Konovalets’s supervision to fully equip the detachments and prepare them for the capture of Kyiv and the liberation of the country from the Hetman. It is planned to raid the governor-general’s palace, the official residence of the Hetman and arrest him. In doing so, however, we may come face to face with Derzhavna Varta, who serves, among other things, as the Hetman’s personal guard. By accomplishing the coup quickly and with less blood, we will save the country from a full-fledged civil war."
ukrpol.16.a: "The Corps is ready to storm Kyiv"

ukrpol.17.t: "Peasant Discontent Is Growing"
ukrpol.17.d: "In the provinces, peasant discontent with rising food prices is growing. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about it, as long as our economy is unstable and the Hryvnia has not stabilized enough. Given the current situation, we need to take some measures to reassure disgruntled farmers."
ukrpol.17.king: "Tighten your belts!"
ukrpol.17.hetman: "Introduce benefits!"

ukrpol.18.t: "Advisor to the King"
ukrpol.18.d: "With the conclusion of the alliance between the King and Lypynskyi, he was granted the right to become an official royal advisor. This way, according to Vasyl, Lypynskyi would be safe, because the Hetman would not dare to encroach on the royal advisor without causing an international scandal involving Austria and Germany. Now Hetman’s hands are virtually tied, and even if he banned Lypynskyi’s party, we can be sure of his personal safety.\n\nMoreover, the position of royal advisor, despite its formality, also gives Lypynskyi the right to officially represent the king."
ukrpol.18.king: "Notify the Hetman of the new position at the Royal court"
ukrpol.18.hetman: "Seems like Lypynskyi received security guarantees."

ukrpol.19.t: "Sich Striltsi Disarmed and Disbanded!"
ukrpol.19.d: "Today it became known that on Hetman’s order all units of the elite units of the Sichovi Striltsi were disarmed and disbanded. Their commander, Yevhen Konovalets, was also demoted. According to Hetman, these units were characterized by virtually uncontrolled activities that were harmful to Ukraine and made it vulnerable to external and internal threats."
ukrpol.19.king: "Who does this Hetman think he is?"
ukrpol.19.hetman: "Another source of instability is destroyed."

ukrpol.20.t: "Yevhen Konovalets Shot Dead!"
ukrpol.20.d: "Today it became known about the unfortunate death of Colonel Yevhen Konovalets, the former leader of the Sichovi Striltsi and the Ukrainian Military Organization. \n\nThis morning in Kyiv, while Konovalets was walking through the city, he was suddenly approached by an unknown assailant who shot the colonel three times. One of the bullets pierced his lung and the other hit his heart, causing Konovalets to die on the spot, bleeding to death. The unknown assailant managed to escape and his whereabouts are still unknown. Derzhavna Varta officially ordered an investigation into the premeditated murder and promised to do everything possible to find the culprit.\n\nThe king spoke on the radio, deploring the death of one of the best sons of the fatherland, a defender of Ukraine and a hero. Hetman also spoke, promising to punish the perpetrators by all means, and stating that it was largely thanks to the colonel that Ukraine was able to defend itself."
ukrpol.20.king: "A great loss for Ukraine" #Dontsov becomes the leader of natpops
ukrpol.20.hetman: "We do not forgive traitors" #Dontsov becomes the leader of natpops

ukrpol.21.t: "A Royal Visit to Vienna"
ukrpol.21.d: "Today it became known about the planned visit of King Vasyl to Vienna. He will attend a reception at the royal palace, where he will meet with Emperor Charles, and then attend unofficial events. As a member of the Habsburg royal family, Vasyl is always welcomed in Vienna."
ukrpol.21.a: "Let us hope they agree"

ukrpol.22.t: "King Vasyl Arrives to Vienna"
ukrpol.22.d: "Today King Vasyl of Ukraine visited Vienna, specifically a reception at the royal palace, where he met with Emperor Charles. Later on, however, the King made a strange request to support him with arms or finances and warned of an assassination attempt being prepared against him. He said that the era of the Hetman was coming to an end and that Ukraine must move into a new phase of nation-building. Whatever that means, we need to support Habsburg!"
ukrpol.22.a: "Provide all the help needed."
ukrpol.22.b: "We cannot spare anything." 

ukrpol.23.t: "Austria Agrees to Help"
ukrpol.23.d: "The emperor of Austria received the king and promised to provide all necessary assistance."
ukrpol.23.a: "Splendid!"

ukrpol.24.t: "Austria Refused to Intervene"
ukrpol.24.d: "The Austrian Empire refused to help us, due to the lack of available resources."
ukrpol.24.a: "Unfortunately."

ukrpol.25.t: "Lypky Assault"
ukrpol.25.d.uvo: "Today, shots were heard in the Kyiv district of Lypky, where the former palace of the governor-general and now the residence of Hetman Skoropadskyi is located. \n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, around noon, units of Sichovi Striltsi under the command of Yevhen Konovalets arrived in the city. Their purpose was to arrest the Hetman, dissolve the Derzhavna Varta and proclaim the power of Soim and the King. Soon there was a gunfight heard between the Derzhavna Varta and the Striltsi, which also acted as a guard for the Hetman, with little loss on either side. The Hetman appealed to the Army to protect the city from the rebellion of the Striltsi, but the officers refused to carry out the order. Soon the Hetman was forced to surrender. He formally abdicated his position of Hetman, being arrested after that.\n\nIn the headlines, the events took place as the Lypky Assault. Shortly after the arrest of the Hetman, an emergency meeting was convened in Soim, at which the King spoke, announcing the end of the era of repression. He also announced that in view of Skoropadskyi’s inability to fulfill his duties as Hetman, he himself became acting Hetman until the leader of one of the parliamentary factions is appointed to the position.\n\nIn Germany, the events were perceived ambiguously, dubbing the events as a coup d'état."
ukrpol.25.d: "Today, shots were heard in the Kyiv district of Lypky, where the former palace of the governor-general and now the residence of Hetman Skoropadskyi is located. \n\nAccording to eyewitness accounts, protests and riots against the hetman began in the city around 10 a.m., initiated by the USKhD. Their aim was to arrest the hetman, dissolve the Derzhavna Varta and proclaim the power of the Soim and the King. The Army was introduced into the city, but it took the side of the rebels. Soon there was a gunfight between the Derzhavna Varta, which also served as the Hetman’s guard, and the Army, with small casualties on both sides. Soon the Hetman was forced to surrender. He formally abdicated his position of Hetman, being arrested after that.\n\nIn the headlines, the events took place as the Lypky Assault. Shortly after the arrest of the Hetman, an emergency meeting was convened in Soim, at which the King spoke, announcing the end of the era of repression. He also announced that in view of Skoropadskyi’s inability to fulfill his duties as Hetman, he himself became acting Hetman until the leader of one of the parliamentary factions is appointed to the position.\n\nIn Germany, the events were perceived ambiguously, dubbing the events as a coup d'état."
ukrpol.25.a: "The End of the Hetmanate!"

ukrpol.26.t: "Consolidating the Hetman’s Power"
ukrpol.26.d: "Ukraine needs reform; the dual power situation can no longer continue. Even though opposition parties are in the minority, Hetman's power needs to be strengthened. On the one hand, we can trust Doroshenko, a supporter of Hetman and leader of the UDP, a spoiler party that takes the liberal and national-democratic electorate, but also wholeheartedly supports the SHD.\nSoim, on the other hand, only brings instability to our current situation, for which Hetman could issue emergency powers and dissolve parliament."
ukrpol.26.a: "We should trust Mikhnovskyi." #will lead to UVO joining Dyrektoria as soon as it revolts
ukrpol.26.b: "It is time to dissolve the Soim." #will lead to death of Konovalets

ukrpol.27.t: "Appointment of the New Governors"
ukrpol.27.d: "As part of the expansion of the coalition with the UDKhP, Hetman passed a resolution appointing new governors: in particular, appointing Fedir Sumnevych as provincial commissar of Volyn and Podillia. Volodymyr Strashkevych, a literary scholar and linguist, was appointed governor of Vinnytsia at Mikhnovskyi's suggestion."
ukrpol.27.king: "Mikhnovskyi entrenches his influence..."
ukrpol.27.hetman: "Hope we can count on them"

ukrpol.28.t: "Ukrainian Conservatism Discredited"
ukrpol.28.d: "Today in a major government newspaper, surprised Kyivans could read an interesting article that Ukrainian conservatism, as articulated by Vyacheslav Lypynskyi, is bad for Ukraine. Many were puzzled, how could a government newspaper condemn the official ideology of the leading party, but soon everything fell into place. It turned out that the only correct Ukrainian conservatism can be only with a Hetman at the head, and of Ukrainian origin, which is only Pavlo Skoropadskyi. And the monarchist Lypynskyi, leader of the opposition, promotes Germanic rule over Ukraine, supporting the claims of a German-imposed king."
ukrpol.28.hetman: "Who even supports the Austrian Impostor?"
ukrpol.28.king: "Hetman discredited the 'Hetman movemement', ridiculous."

ukrpol.29.t: "Soim Dissolved. Martial Law Enacted."
ukrpol.29.d: "According to Article 16 of the Laws on the State Structure of Ukraine, the Hetman has the right to dissolve the Soim and establish a state of emergency at any time. This article, which significantly restricts parliament, allows the Hetman to occupy the dominant position in the state structure of Ukraine, but so far this article has never been used, due to the strong position of the pro-Hetman SHD party and the weakness of the anti-Hetman opposition in parliament.\n\nUsing his emergency powers, Skoropadskyi announced the premature dissolution of the Sejm and the assumption of full authority under the state of emergency caused by the economic crisis and the unbridled terrorist activities unleashed by the Dyrektoria. \n\nThanks to this, the Hetman will have the right to pass any emergency laws, including those that will help him to establish his absolute power."
ukrpol.29.hetman: "Our State needs stability, not empty chatter!"
ukrpol.29.king: "Another loophole in our Constitution!"

ukrpol.30.t: "Hetman’s Emergency Powers"
ukrpol.30.d: "Under the state of emergency, Hetman Skoropadskyi issued a decree to assume emergency powers and intensify anti-terrorist measures until Ukraine returned to the path of stability and the Dyrektoria was destroyed.\n\nAs part of his extraordinary powers, apparently used to reduce the influence of Parliament and the King, literally the first decree of Pan Hetman was the right of the Hetman to appoint a government, a right previously taken away from him by a change in the laws. Although the Hetman only confirmed the Ataman of Ministers and the ministers themselves proposed by Soim, such a measure would enable him not merely to reject all the proposals of the opposition parliament, but simply to ignore them."
ukrpol.30.hetman: "Just a suspension of externally imposed laws"
ukrpol.30.king: "Skoropadskyi only makes himself new enemies"

ukrpol.31.t: "Conspiracy Rumors"
ukrpol.31.d: "Rumors circulating in the press and in small circles about a plot in the armed forces and parliament to overthrow Hetman have flooded the backstage of the government. \n\nAccording to the latest information, a group of high-ranking generals is planning to establish a new power by armed force and arrest Hetman, the main beneficiaries being, of course, the King and the opposition parliament.\n\nThis state of affairs is unacceptable, and the Hetman has therefore issued a decree granting the Power Varta the power to conduct searches and wiretaps without the need for a judicial warrant, for the security of the country and the state."
ukrpol.31.a: "Derzhavna Varta should not feel itself constrained."

ukrpol.32.t: "Explosion on the Dnieper"
ukrpol.32.d: "Today at 11 a.m. while our King Vasily was relaxing on his yacht, an explosion ripped through the hull immediately killing him. Our minister of security has just received a telegram from a socialist group claiming responsibility for mining His yacht, stating that the action was as a result of their exclusion from the democratic process. There was no chance to save our King and already the country has been plunged into disorder.\n\nThe Hetman, now alone with an empty throne, has announced that soon the Heir to the throne would be chosen by the Regency Council, headed by him, and the succession issues all to be resolved.\n\nBefore it happens, though, he has announced that he will stay as the Supreme Leader, with Martial Law still in effect."
ukrpol.32.a: "A tragedy for the entire nation!"

ukrpol.33.t: "The Regency Council"
ukrpol.33.d: "In the wake of the sudden death of the heirless King Vasyl of Habsburg-Lorraine, the Hetman announced the convening of the Council of Regents, headed by himself, with the goal of taking measures to determine the rightful heir to the Ukrainian throne.\n\nSo far the main candidates for the throne are uncertain and the Board of Regents is in the initial stages of its actions, but many are already predicting that the decision of the Board of Regents will change Ukraine beyond recognition..."
ukrpol.33.a: "The decision will be made... soon."

ukrpol.34.t: "Sichovi Striltsi Mobilize in Bila Tserkva"
ukrpol.34.d: "After the successful coup, the Sichovi Striltsi, led by UVO leader Yevhen Konovalets, returned to their base in Bila Tserkva. However, rumors soon reached the capital that the elite units were hurriedly preparing for a new offensive. Fearing a counter-coup, the King ordered roadblocks to be set up on all roads leading out of Kyiv, but this can hardly help us..."
ukrpol.34.a: "Something is in the air..."

ukrpol.35.t: "Storming of the Royal Palace"
ukrpol.35.d: "Today the Sichovi Striltsi marched out of Bila Tserkva in full combat readiness, and recruited an additional volunteer legion. It was not difficult for them to bypass the roadblocks, where they met little or no resistance, and enter Kyiv. Soon there was an assault on the royal palace near the Soim, but the defenders soon laid down their arms in view of the superiority of the enemy. The police also refused to participate in what was going on, which left the King alone with a crowd of armed men.\n\nVasyl hastily signed the abdication, appointing Konovalets as regent. At the same time, the Striltsi arrested the Soim in its entirety and announced its temporary dissolution until the next elections. Vasyl was given the chance to leave the country, which he did, traveling to Lviv.\n\nOn the same evening, newspapers published Konovalets' appeal to the inhabitants of Ukraine that the Kingdom had fallen and a new, national republic would now replace the past corrupt government. The population as a whole supported the nationalist coup, hoping for a change for the better in the economic life of the country and long-awaited sovereignty from outside forces."
ukrpol.35.a: "Is this the birth of new Ukraine?"

ukrpol.301.t: "Mykola Mikhnovskyi Returns From Kuban"
ukrpol.301.d: "Mikhnovskyi came to Kyiv today. The hardened nationalist and author of the first draft of the Ukrainian Constitution got off the train after returning from \"exile\". No one, of course, officially stylized Mikhnovskyi's stay in the Kuban as exile, but everyone was well aware of it. And now, a decade later, Mikhnovskyi himself appeared in Kyiv - the new Minister of Foreign Affairs at the behest of the Hetman himself.\n\nOf course, for many people it was rather a symbol of the decline of the Hetmanate. Having hesitated to appoint Mikhnovskyi as Otoman of the Council of Ministers in 1918, Hetman offered him the place of his \"Personal Advisor (Bunchuznyi Tovarish)\", which deeply hurt the feelings of the ambitious politician, who soon afterwards went into opposition, but could not support the Socialists of the Dyrektoria either, whom he hated.\n\nWith the appointment of Mikhnovskyi as Minister of Foreign Affairs, one should not expect much. And despite the fact that Hetman now has at least some ally, let's see what this partnership will bring in the future."
ukrpol.301.king: "That lunatic? Pathetic..."
ukrpol.301.hetman: "We welcome Mikhnovskyi in Kyiv!"

### First Dyrektoria uprising (ukrpol.36-100)

ukrpol.36.t: "Fall of Rivne"
ukrpol.36.d: "Tonight, detachments of thousands of troops of the so-called \"Army of the UNR\" under the leadership of Symon Petliura crossed the border of Galicia and Ukraine. On their way they hastily seized Lutsk, which surrendered without a fight, and headed toward Rivne. \n\nIn Rivne by that time they already knew about the approaching troops and declared a state of emergency. However, to the surprise of many, the Dyrektoria’s propaganda worked to their advantage, and the townspeople and many of the gendarmes not only abandoned the confrontation, but also took the side of the Republic. Small battles broke out in the city, but our troops were forced to retreat and take up defensive positions near Zhytomyr and Vinnytsia. \n\nMeanwhile, the head of the Dyrektoria, Volodymyr Vynnychenko, arrived in Rivne, immediately announcing the restoration of the Ukrainian People’s Republic and the liberation march on Kyiv."
ukrpol.36.a: "We should mobilize!"

ukrpol.37.t: "Uprising Crushed!"
ukrpol.37.d: "Tonight, detachments of thousands of troops of the so-called \"Army of the UNR\" under the leadership of Symon Petliura crossed the border of Galicia and Ukraine. On their way they hastily seized Lutsk, which surrendered without a fight, and headed toward Rivne. \n\nIn Rivne by that time they already knew about the approaching troops and declared a state of emergency. The city was ready for a siege and was well armed. The UNR Army was unable to take it and was driven back to Lutsk, where our troops counterattacked to dislodge them from the city. Seeing the enormous superiority of our troops, the UNR army rushed to flee with Petliura until control of the border with Galicia was fully restored.\n\nThe Dyrektoria’s "liberation" campaign clearly failed and they were forced to lay low in Galicia."
ukrpol.37.a: "The Ukrainian borders are safe!"

ukrpol.38.t: "The Dyrektoria Question"
ukrpol.38.d: "After the Nationalists had more or less gained power, a telegram reached our leadership from Galicia that the so-called Dyrektoria was ready to recognize our government on the condition that fair elections were held. Although the UWO is convinced that the socialists have no place in the new Ukraine, we could have accepted their offer, because in that case a sufficient number of experienced generals of the UNR, including Petlyura, would have joined our troops. As for the elections, the UWO insists on maintaining the "temporary" dictatorship of the UWO until better times come, without, however, openly stating when those times will come.\n\nOn the other hand, the recognition of the Dyrektoria may undermine our credibility and sooner or later their socialist leaders may direct the people’s discontent not at our enemies, but at ourselves."
ukrpol.38.a: "Some of them may join us."
ukrpol.38.b: "We are not welcoming any socialists here."

ukrpol.39.t: "The Ukrainian Galician Army Leaves for Ukraine"
ukrpol.39.d: "The officers, serving in the Ukrainian Galician Army, formed in the early 1920s, have left our country in order to join the uprising of the Ukrainian People’s Republic in Rivne.\n\nThey have left the Galicia-Lodomeria today in the morning and are expected to arrive in Rivne tomorrow.\nThe UGA, led by an experienced officer, Hnat Stefaniv, was an important volunteer force in our state, and the only possible garrison in the Ukrainian-majority territory."
ukrpol.39.a: "Off they go!"

ukrpol.40.t: "Officers From Ukrainian Galician Army Join"
ukrpol.40.d: "The officers, serving in the Ukrainian Galician Army, formed in the early 1920s, have joined our Command.\n\nThey have left the Galicia-Lodomeria yesterday morning and have now arrived in Rivne, where the headquarters of the Ukrainian People’s Republic is located.\nThe UGA, led by an experienced officer, Hnat Stefaniv, has taken an oath of loyalty and allegiance to the People’s Republic."
ukrpol.40.a: "Splendid!"

ukrpol.54.t: "Talks with Crimean Dyrektoria"
ukrpol.54.d: "The recent clashes in Crimea have shown that there is also an anti-Hetmanist movement there. We have contacted the so-called Crimean Dyrektoria and its leader, Solomon Krym. He has recently returned from exile to lead a separatist anti-Hetmanist movement. However, his final goal is to make Crimean Tatars independent, which is not what our plans are."
ukrpol.54.a: "We should have an ally in the south."
ukrpol.54.b: "What?! Crimea is Ukraine!"

ukrpol.55.t: "Peasant Unrest in South-East"
ukrpol.55.d: "In the rural regions of [227.GetName] and [200.GetName] the peasants have rebelled against our rule. Fooled by the Dyrektorian propaganda, they have decided that everything good that happened to them during the Hetmanate was bad. We failed to secure our rear and now we have to deal with the peasants as well."
ukrpol.55.a: "Damn!"

ukrpol.56.t: "Peasants Take Up Pitchforks and Arms!"
ukrpol.56.d: "More and more peasants are joining the unrest, causing damage to the towns and cities of Ukraine!"
ukrpol.56.a: "Damn!"

ukrpol.61.t: "Decisive Blow to the Dyrektoria"
ukrpol.61.d: "Loyal troops were able to successfully break through the defenses built by the rebels in Rivne and seized most of Volhynia. The peasant uprising in the South was successfully suppressed, and finally the entire territory of Ukraine was back under our control.\n\nThe cowardly Republicans were able to hide in Galicia, but we have no doubt that they will no longer venture into our territory with their anti-state slogans, and sooner or later we will be able to negotiate with the Austrians so that they will give us these traitors and criminals."
ukrpol.61.a: "Victory!"

ukrpol.63.t: "Fall of Kyiv"
ukrpol.63.d: "After prolonged resistance and siege, key troops were withdrawn from Kyiv and the city was surrendered to the enemy. Our ruler was forced to leave power and the capital and go abroad, losing control of most of the country. However, this was not the end. Although power no longer extended to the Southeast and South, where the formation of people's councils and self-government of workers and peasants had effectively begun, and, in some cases, treacherous defections to the enemy, there were still remnants of loyalists in the country who did not want to surrender."
ukrpol.63.a: "Hetman is forced to abdicate!"
ukrpol.63.b: "King flees to Austria!"

ukrpol.630.t: "Military Coup"
ukrpol.630.d: "Despite widespread military skirmishes, today in [ROOT.Capital.GetName], a military parade was held, and the so-called government, represented by government officials, spoke in the city center to announce its resignation. The general indifference and realization of a speedy capture by Petliura's troops soon turned into jubilation by the crowd. One of the Hetman's loyal officers and his former personal adjutant, Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, rode into the center of the square on horseback and announced to the assembled crowd that he was taking full power for the protection of the Ukrainian state.\n\nThe very next day, the first decrees of the new supreme leader were issued - on the establishment of the national Ukrainian People's Cossack Republic, a return to the traditions of the Hetmanate and the formation of a new, Cossack government. "
ukrpol.630.a: "Is he the last hope for the Hetmanate?"

ukrpol.64.t: "The Remnants of Derzavnyks"
ukrpol.64.d: "The last troops, who had praised the King and the Hetman until long ago, finally surrendered. We have been able to establish complete control over our territories, and despite the widespread chaos, growing anarchy and banditry, we can confidently say that in the midst of all this mess there are no more people left who are willing to take up arms against our new, popular government, for the rule of landlords and hetmans. \n\nThe era of injustice and inequality is over, military parades are being held in the cities, and people are triumphing and plundering the rich grounds of their neighbors. Ukraine is unstable, and it needs to return to unity for the sake of the common future of our citizens."
ukrpol.64.a: "Victory!"

ukrpol.66.t: "Workers Rebel in the East!"
ukrpol.66.d: "Despite the initial peasant uprisings were crushed in the South and in the East, now the workers have risen a second powerful uprising, also joined by some peasants. Seizing some of the administrative buildings and also stopping the factories, they are a serious threat to the Hetmanate regime."
ukrpol.66.a: "A serious blow to the Hetmanate!"
ukrpol.66.b: "We must do something!"

### Dyrektoria interactions

ukrpol.67.t: "Ukrainian Demands"
ukrpol.67.d: "The Ukrainian government has sent us an official note of protest for supporting the so-called Dyrektoria, the government of the Ukrainian People’s Republic in exile. According to them, we are harboring terrorists who are actively engaged in sabotage and anti-monarchist propaganda in Ukraine."
ukrpol.67.a: "What can we do?"
ukrpol.67.b: "Pressure the 'Dyrektoria'"

ukrpol.68.t: "Galicia Can Do Nothing"
ukrpol.68.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has told us that they can do nothing in order to stop this. They believe that it is our internal affairs and our problems, they just host the government-in-exile and they cannot arrest them."
ukrpol.68.a: "Damn."

ukrpol.69.t: "Galicia Pressures Dyrektoria"
ukrpol.69.d: "Our [FROM.GetAdjective] representatives have confirmed that they have threatened the Dyrektoria to cease any operations in [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] with stopping their support for their 'government-in-exile'."
ukrpol.69.a: "Great!"

ukrpol.70.t: "Anti-Monarchist Protests in Large Cities"
ukrpol.70.d: "Today, anti-government rallies were held in major cities, in spite of the direct prohibition of the Derzavna Varta and Hetman, under brightly colored anti-monarchist slogans. Crowds of townspeople, mostly workers and poor bourgeoisie, demanded bread and the abdication of the king, as well as a change of government, the legalization of strikes and opposition parties, in general - everything that the revolutionary-terrorists of the Dyrektoria had promised them. \n\nThe crowds of protesters at first felt completely unpunished until heavily armed punitive squads arrived in the cities, and army troops were even brought into some major cities. The crowds were dispersed, usually without casualties, and the instigators were arrested and awaiting trial."
ukrpol.70.a: "Disperse the crowd!"

ukrpol.71.t: "Borotbysts Distribute Leaflets"
ukrpol.71.d: "We have heard rumors that the only terrorist organization operating in Ukraine, calling itself the Borotbysts, which does not formally associate itself with the Dyrektoria, has begun to distribute leaflets calling for an all-Ukrainian strike to stop factories and other industry and the revolutionary demands of the people, among which are the resignation of the government and the abdication of the king.\n\nThis state of affairs is totally unsatisfactory, and in this connection the Hetman ordered the Derzhavna Varta to immediately begin intensified reconnaissance of the alleged source of these leaflets, and to find and arrest the management of the printers who agreed to print these anti-government leaflets."
ukrpol.71.a: "Find the typographies that helps them!"

ukrpol.72.t: "Russophiles Announce Support for Skoropadskyi"
ukrpol.72.d: "The russophiles, mainly situated in the State Army and in the ruling party of SHD, are rallying in the support of the Hetman Skoropadskyi. They see him as a true successor of the Imperial order and lobby reorientation towards Russia."
ukrpol.72.a: "Interesting."

ukrpol.73.t: "Unrest in Volhynia"
ukrpol.73.d: "Volhynia is considered one of the unstable provinces of our state, because of its proximity to the borders of Galicia, it is in Rivne that the sympathies of the Dyrektoria and the Republican movement are strongest. Despite our efforts to pacify Rivne, spontaneous rallies were held there today under the banners of the Dyrektoria and demanding the convening of an All-Ukrainian Constituent Assembly. The peaceful rallies soon turned into riots, and the police had to forcibly disperse the rampaging crowd of looters and protesters."
ukrpol.73.a: "We cannot lose Volhynia!"

ukrpol.74.t: "Kharkiv Strikes"
ukrpol.74.d: "In addition to the west of the country, the east is also restless. Workers in Kharkiv went on mass strike today, demanding a shorter workday and higher wages. Following Donbas, Kharkiv residents sabotaged the work of large factories in the east. Anti-monarchist and socialist slogans were again strong among the slogans that spread. The strike was suppressed, and additional security forces were brought into the region."
ukrpol.74.a: "Will they ever calm down?"

ukrpol.75.d: "Today at 11 a.m. while the Ukrainian King Vasyl was relaxing on his yacht, an explosion ripped through the hull immediately killing him. Our minister of security has just received a telegram from a socialist group claiming responsibility for mining His yacht, stating that the action was as a result of their exclusion from the democratic process. There was no chance to save our King and already the country has been plunged into disorder.\n\nThe Hetman, now alone with an empty throne, has announced that soon the Heir to the throne would be chosen by the Regency Council, headed by him, and the succession issues all to be resolved.\n\nBefore it happens, though, he has announced that he will stay as the Supreme Leader, with Martial Law still in effect."

ukrpol.76.d: "Today, shots were heard in the Kyiv district of Lypky, Ukraine, where the former palace of the governor-general and now the residence of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi is located.\n\nAccording to the eyewitnesses, around noon, there has been armed clashes between Skoropadskyi’s loyalists and the opposition, which eventually led to the defeat of the Hetman. He was forced to retire and abdicate his claims to the Hetmanate. The King has announced that the power in the country is to be transfered to the elected Ukrainian Soim. In Germany, the events were perceived ambiguously, dubbing the events as a coup d'état."

ukrpol.77.t: "Volhynia Secured!"
ukrpol.77.d: "We have managed to successfully secure control over the whole Volhynia region. Now, the Dyrektoria is divided on the matter on what to do next. We can take a break and get ready for the full-scale war or try to establish control over Kyiv in a short amount of time, due to the help of Striltsi in Bila Tserkva."
ukrpol.77.a: "We should get ready for attack."
ukrpol.77.b: "We should do it quickly and bloodless"

ukrpol.78.t: "Kyiv Falls!"
ukrpol.78.d: "Thanks to the Striltsi, we managed to quickly seize Kyiv and establish our control there. The monarchist forces tried to fight back, but fellow Ukrainians walked to the streets to show their support for the Dyrektoria government. The Hetmanists never managed to shoot at the crowd and they had to give up with [UPR.GetLeader] fleeing abroad."
ukrpol.78.a: "People on our side!"

Before Dyrektoria managed to secure their control over Volhynia, we managed to raise some loyalists in Berestia and Lutsk, and with the help of Zhytomyr garrison we have surrounded the headquarters of the rebels. Some of them managed to escape, but demoralized rebel troops have all surrendered."
ukrpol.81.a: "Did they really want to defeat us?"

ukrpol.82.t: "Failure of the Operation"
ukrpol.82.d: "Unfortunately, the operation was a complete failure. We missed when Dyrektoria managed to secure their control over Volhynia, and by the time our agents arrived there, they have already been ready. Our Agents were surrounded and the attack failed. It seems that the full-scale war is even closer now."

ukrpol.89.d: "It has been several weeks since we lost control of Volyn, and the revolutionaries have occupied Rivne and established organizations under their control in the region. All this time, new recruits and insurgents have been pouring into their territory from Galicia and even from Naddnipryanshchina. Finally, however, we can confidently state that we have established full control over the line of contact, and according to our intelligence, the last stronghold of resistance to the revolutionaries in Volhynia has been destroyed. All this clearly leads to an escalation of the confrontation, for the Dyrektoria was able to establish full control over its territory and now they are clearly preparing to strike at the capital."
ukrpol.89.a: "We shall crush the insurgency!"


### Pavlo Skoropadskyi Main Political ###
ukrpol.100.t: "Hetman Skoropadskyi Visits Austria"
ukrpol.100.d: "Today the Hetman of All Ukraine, Pavlo Skoropadskyi, arrived in Vienna with an official delegation. Such a high-ranking meeting may indicate that the Hetman has something to tell our government about the terrible act of terrorism that took place on the Dnieper River, and which resulted in the death of the King of Ukraine, Vasyl, known as Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen. \n\nThe hetman announced that the main accused had already been found and that they were taking refuge in Galicia. Known as the Dyrektoria, they represent a kind of body claiming power in all of Ukraine. The Dyrektoria consists of various kinds of Ukrainian nationalists and socialists, who prefer to organize terror. Hetman cited much evidence of their active anti-monarchist activities prior to the explosion on the Dnieper.\n\nIn this regard, Hetman once again expressed his condolences to the royal house of Habsburg, and moved on to more pressing issues, namely the question of the belonging of Galicia and the Ukrainians living there. He said that under Ukrainian supervision the Dyrektoria based there would be defeated, of which we can have no doubt."
ukrpol.100.a: "Better not lose such an ally."
ukrpol.100.b: "No talks until Leo Stefan is crowned a King of Ukraine!"

ukrpol.101.t: "Austria Agrees!"
ukrpol.101.d: "Hetman was able to negotiate with the Austrians for the transfer of the Ukrainian-speaking lands of Galicia-Lodomeria to the control of our country. Moreover, he did so on quite favorable terms, not only reconciling our governments after the explosion on the Dnieper, but also promising benefits for trade with Austria. "
ukrpol.101.a: "Splendid!"

ukrpol.102.t: "Austria Refused!"
ukrpol.102.d: "The Hetman had recently arrived in Vienna for important negotiations on the status of Galicia and trade with Austria. Despite his arguments, Austria refused to give us control of the Ukrainian lands until Vasyl’s heir, Leo Stefan, was crowned king of Ukraine.\n\nOf course, the Hetman reminded the Austrian government that the question of the succession had not been resolved during Vasyl’s reign, and therefore the heir to the throne was an unresolved issue that would be decided by the Regency Council. This, however, in no way saved our situation."
ukrpol.102.a: "Their loss!"

ukrpol.103.t: "Ukraine Demands We Increase the Tariffs!"
ukrpol.103.d: "There was a suggestion from our friendly Ukraine that we immediately raise import tariffs, a measure we took at the dawn of Black Monday to stabilize the economic situation and which led Ukraine itself into an agricultural crisis and almost collapse. \n\nThe proposal, however, is more in the form of demands and clearly tests our government's loyalty to the Ukrainian regime. Despite the fact that this state has an exceptional role in our alliance and the stability of the supply and food supply for our large army, economists calculate that the decision to raise tariffs could harm our not yet fully established economy."
ukrpol.103.a: "Better not lose such an ally"

ukrpol.105.t: "Germany Refused!"
ukrpol.105.d: "The German government has refused our demands, leaving the tarrifs as they are, meaning that we will continue to lose money and agricultural products."

He comes from a Cossack lineage and his ancestors ruled this land. In addition, the state built in Ukraine was the Skoropadskyi’s achievement, and the appointment of a new Austrian king will further deepen the division of the elites and the people. \n\nThe Hetman himself, however, has not yet stated that he definitely agrees to this proposal. He said that his son, Hetmanych Danylo, was also worthy of receiving the throne, and that he is also a true Ukrainian and son of his homeland."

ukrpol.150.d: "Unfortunately, our King has no children and as such theoretically has the right to choose his successor. In practice however, this decision is up to the Ukrainian government itself and only two candidates are even being considered by senior ministers. The nephew of Vasyl, Leo Stefan Habsburg and Danylo Skoropadskyi, son of the deposed Hetman, are both contenders for the throne. Most of the USKhD members support Danylo as they believe he will weaken Ukrainian dependence on the Reichspakt by virtue of his lack of royal ties with the European dynasties. Leo, despite his dynastic ties, only has support from the Volodymyr Zalozetskyi-Sas and his associates, many of whom have serious connections with Austria. The question now is which is preferable."
ukrpol.150.a: "Leo Stefan Habsburg!"

While we are planning to get rid of this position completely, changing it to a normal Head of the Council of Ministers, the reforms have not been accepted yet.\n\nTherefore, a temporary \"Hetman\" should be appointed, no longer the supreme leader, but a restricted position of head of government. With the USKhD in power, there are only two choices for the King: either Vyacheslav Lypynskyi, head of the USKhD, or the Vasyl loyalist, Volodymyr Zalozetskyi-Sas, a philantropist from Bukovina region."
ukrpol.151.a: "Volodymyr Zalozetskyi-Sas, Vasyl's close associate."

Though it will have some amendments, refering to the traditional Ukrainian culture, mostly suggested by the USKhD, it won't have any position seriously overpowered.\n\nThe Constitution removes the position of Hetman, and replaces the Soim with the National Rada. The leader of the ruling party will become the Head of Government. With the sooner enactment of the New Constitution, Ukraine will finally throw off the shackles of absolutism."

It is therefore proposed that the Kingdom be immediately renamed Hetmanate, as is the proclamation of Vasyl as Hetman of All Ukraine, and his successor as Hetmanich. \nIn addition, it is proposed that the succession to the throne, and the rights of the heirs of Hetmanich to the throne of Ukraine, be secured by a special law."

As Lypynskyi stated, \"The Cossacks are a personal dignity that is not inherited.\"\n\nThe Assembly of the Ukrainian Cossacks will soon form its own governing bodies according to the territorial principle, which are subordinate to the Great Cossack Rada under the Hetman.

In their eyes, such circumstances can lead to overall instability in Ukraine, and, therefore, they have publicly discredited Zalozetskyi-Sas and his supporters.\n\nIn the past, the USKhD has once outlived the similar schism with Skoropadskyi leaving the party to form his own - SHD. However, that time, it was Lypynskyi on the 'liberal' side of the split.\n\nNevertheless, the decision of the Party Congress to cancel membership of Zalozetskyi-Sas and his supporters has led to a significant scandal and even a political crisis. While the Prime-Minister has denounced this decision, he has now been working on establishing a new political faction in the [GetUkrainianParliamentFullName], later to be established in a completely new party. Receiving the name of UMP (Ukrainian Monarchist Party), the new governing organisation has already begun the work to establish itself as a separate from the USKhD political entity."

ukrsun.16.a: "A major ally in Europe is good, but we are more interested in their territories."
ukrsun.16.b: "We agree on alliance, but we won't support their claims!"
ukrsun.16.c: "It is rather a good deal."

ukrsun.17.t: "[FROM.GetName] Rejects!"
ukrsun.17.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has rejected our offer. It seems that we will have to fight them once more."
ukrsun.17.a: "Their loss!"

ukrsun.18.t: "[FROM.GetName] Negotiates About the Territories"
ukrsun.18.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to our offer, but they reject our claims in Belarus and Don-Kuban! It is a question of primary importance whether we should ally them, but loose our claims."
ukrsun.18.a: "This is unacceptable!"
ukrsun.18.b: "At least they are not against our claims in Poland and Galicia!"

ukrsun.19.t: "[FROM.GetName] Gives up Claims!"
ukrsun.19.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] nationalist government has agreed to give up their claims in our rightful territories. We should sign the pact with them now."
ukrsun.19.a: "A toast to our Ukrainian brothers!"

ukrsun.20.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused to Give up Claims!"
ukrsun.20.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] nationalist government has refused to give up their claims in our rightful territories. It seems that now our confrontation is almost impossible to avoid."
ukrsun.20.a: "Let us see how they will cope with our armies."

ukrsun.21.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agrees!"
ukrsun.21.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to recognize our claims and sign a secret pact. It seems that we now have a new 'friend' in the East."

### Dyrektoria and Socialists ###

ukrsoc.1.t: "Victory of the People’s Republic!"
ukrsoc.1.d: "After the capture of Kyiv, the defense of the so-called "Kingdom" fell apart. Soldiers began to defect en masse to our side, realizing our superiority, and some commanders surrendered. Control of Kyiv meant control of the railroad, and our partisans in the south, in conjunction with the Borotbysts, were able to quickly capture key industrial centers.\n\nThe Hetman government managed to escape from Kyiv and found refuge abroad, but along with the German puppets we drove out the Germans themselves. Now Ukraine is truly a people’s republic where people’s power will rule. However, for this to happen, an All-Ukrainian Constituent Congress must be convened."
ukrsoc.1.a: "We should immediately hold All-Ukrainian Congress!"

ukrsoc.2.t: "Anarchy on the Streets"
ukrsoc.2.d: "Despite our victory, we cannot yet say that our power is strong. There is anarchy and looting in many cities. The poor rob the rich, the peasants steal from the landlords. The situation is clearly beyond our control. \n\nSymon Petliura, Otaman of the UNR Army, concurrently Minister of War of the Dyrektoria, proposed the immediate creation of a people’s militia in order to bring the situation in the cities back under the control of the central government. However, many believe that this would only strengthen his authority and that the creation of a militia loyal to and under Petliura’s control might play into his hands."
ukrsoc.2.a: "Whatever, we need to call a congress"
ukrsoc.2.b: "Form the people’s militia to deal with the chaos"

ukrsoc.3.t: "Borotbysts Sabotage the Plants"
ukrsoc.3.d: "The Borotbysts, who were not formally part of the Dyrektoria, began sabotaging the work of the factories, demanding decisive measures from our still-unstable provisional government to improve the lives of workers. Despite the fact that their main electorate is peasants, workers are also under the influence of the Borotbysts. \n\nOleksandr Shumskyi spoke at a rally in Kharkiv, where he stated that until the Directorate takes measures to protect workers' rights, our people’s government is not at all popular, but reactionary and bourgeois. Minister of War Petliura suggested that the strikes be dealt with immediately, that the workers be dispersed, and that we should not wait for the decrees of the legally elected All-Ukrainian Congress."
ukrsoc.3.a: "We can't wait anymore, a congress should be held!"
ukrsoc.3.b: "Petliurivtsi shall restore the work on the plants"

ukrsoc.4.t: "Last Monarchist Resistance in Poltava"
ukrsoc.4.d: "In Poltava, the region which is considered the most conservative"
ukrsoc.4.a: "They will calm down eventually, call a congress!"
ukrsoc.4.b: "Calm the Poltava turmoul!"

ukrsoc.5.t: "Rampant Crime in Odesa"
ukrsoc.5.d: "With the departure of the German garrison from Odesa, the situation there became somewhat heated, especially with regard to rampant crime. Nevertheless, the hetman’s oprichniks maintained some order in the city. However, with both of them fleeing and with insufficient control over the city, Odesa experienced a true flowering of criminality and anarchy, stronger than in other cities. \n\nRobbery, looting, and corruption have taken off with renewed vigor, and the local militia of the People’s Republic clearly lacks the strength to suppress it. Petliura addressed a meeting of the Dyrektoria, demanding that troops be immediately sent to Odesa and that all those involved in the looting be arrested, in effect hinting at a curfew and the arrest of anyone who fell under suspicion. This is a very risky step that we cannot take without losing the support of the people."
ukrsoc.5.a: "It’s not a hindrance to the Congress"
ukrsoc.5.b: "Arrest all those involved!" 

ukrsoc.6.t: "Dismissal of the Monarchist Officials"
ukrsoc.6.d: "One of the controversial decisions that must be made as a matter of urgency is the dismissal of all officials who collaborated with the hetman’s regime. \n\nAlthough many in the Dyrektoria are in favor of full lustration, for some this step seems reckless. We can win over to our side the people who have been managing the country for 20 years instead of arresting or firing them all, because unlike the new government, the old apparatus has real work experience."
ukrsoc.6.a: "Dismiss them all!"
ukrsoc.6.b: "We cannot be left without the support of those who have ruled the country for 20 years!"
ukrsoc.6.c: "This should be discussed at the Congress"

ukrsoc.7.t: "Question of the Monarchist Parties"
ukrsoc.7.d: "With the coming of the Dyrektoria to power, the monarchist parties came under attack, to which our government includes all the legal parties that acted in support of the King and the Hetman, namely: Mikhnovskyi’s UDKhP, Bolbochan's UPSS, Lypynskyi’s USKhD, and Skoropadskyi’s SHD.\n\nSome advocate the immediate prohibition of the activity of all counter-revolutionary parties, while others believe that this should be decided at the All-Ukrainian Congress within the framework of the people’s power."
ukrsoc.7.a: "They should be banned!"
ukrsoc.7.b: "The Congress should decide this"

ukrsoc.8.t: "Business is Fleeing the Country!"
ukrsoc.8.d: "The uprising of the Directory was accompanied not only by increased anarchy and violence throughout the country and mass looting of landed estates, groundless arrests, and a hetmaniacal police force, but also by a more significant factor.\n\nBlack Monday and the crisis that followed brought us to an almost complete economic collapse. Most frightening of all, business is fleeing the country - young and mature entrepreneurs are trying to take time to move their assets to nearby countries still open to them. This is accompanied by a massive brain and personnel drain; in fact, the country is being deprived of its future. Of course, many enterprises have already been nationalized, and in some cases expropriated by the new people's state, but the loss of initiative and entrepreneurial spirit among our citizens may have an effect on our future."
ukrsoc.8.a: "Catastrophic."

ukrsoc.9.t: "The First Day of the Congress"
ukrsoc.9.d: "It was time for the Congress to be called. In many regions of Ukraine, the active creation of local government bodies has already begun, particularly Soviets and Radas, through which various politicians, organizations, and parties plan to make their way to the All-Ukrainian Congress and participate in the legislation of vital and defining bills, as well as vote for the composition of the government."
ukrsoc.9.a: "Let us begin..."
ukrsoc.9.b: "Petliura dissolves the assembly with the help of army"

ukrsoc.10.t: "Controversy in the Poltava Village Council"
ukrsoc.10.d: "In Poltava, which before the Dyrektoria came to power was considered the bastion of the reactionaries and the main stronghold of the Hetman movement, new realities set in. In a village in the Poltavshchyna the situation reached a deadlock. The local council was actually divided 50-50 over which delegates they would support at the All-Ukrainian Congress. \n\nOn the one hand, the position of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who promise land to the peasants, which is especially important for the predominantly agrarian region of Poltava, is quite strong. On the other hand, the positions of the Ukapists, whose program is aimed not only at the peasants, but also at the workers, are not inferior to the SRs’ one. For the ordinary inhabitants of this small village, this issue proved vital, but it could hardly influence the outcome of the All-Ukrainian Congress. However, the local Poltava newspapers brought attention to the story, with the result that the outcome of the vote in a single village could also influence the polls of the entire Poltavshchyna..."
ukrsoc.10.a: "Poltava village council supports the UPSR..."
ukrsoc.10.b: "Poltava village council turns to the UKP"

ukrsoc.11.t: "All of the Delegates Arrived"
ukrsoc.11.d: "Finally, from Kyiv comes the joyous news that all the delegates from the councils, local Radas, factory commissioners, and national minorities have arrived at the All-Ukrainian Congress. The congress, which is destined to put an end to the Hetman bourgeoisie, unbridled capitalism and robbery of ordinary Ukrainians. The four main parties of the Directory: the UKP, the UPSR, the USDRP and the PULD(s-f), will offer their versions of the vision of the Ukrainian future, after which delegates will have to vote for the party whose ideas, in their opinion, are the most worthy."
ukrsoc.11.a: "Future of Ukraine is in our hands"

ukrsoc.12.t: "Administrative Reform"
ukrsoc.12.d: "The administrative-territorial division of the Ukrainian People's Republic was established on March 6, 1918, by the law 'On the administrative-territorial division of Ukraine'. According to it, Ukraine was divided into 32 administrative units of the first order - Zemli (Lands), which, in turn, were divided into Volosts, and Volosts - into Communities. This division existed until Hetman Skoropadskyi came to power and was abolished by him on April 29, 1918, as a result the state was divided into Okruhas (Provinces), following the administrative division of the Russian Empire.\n\nNow that power was once again in the hands of the People's Republic, the question of administrative division was again raised. On the one hand, the current division was outdated and did not allow for effective resolution of local issues; on the other hand, it would not prevent local self-government from organizing itself arbitrarily in a particular province."
ukrsoc.12.a: "We should get rid of the Imperial past."
ukrsoc.12.b: "Current division is just fine."

ukrsoc.13.t: "Borotbysts Boycott the Congress!"
ukrsoc.13.d: "Today, the Central Committee of the UPSR(b), headed by Oleksandr Shumskyi, officially announced a boycott of the elections to the All-Ukrainian Congress, accusing the parties involved of revisionism. However, despite the official statements about the boycott, many of the Borotbyst members supported the UPSR in the elections to the Constituent Congress as their former party-mates and closest ideological allies. "
ukrsoc.13.a: "What are they up to?"

ukrsoc.14.t: "Non-Functioning Plant"
ukrsoc.14.d: "From the moment the Directory came to power, striking workers flooded the major cities, the strikes paralyzed many factories, and in some cases we can speak of sabotage of production!\n\nHowever, even after some stabilization of society and the economy, many factories throughout the country, including such a massive industrial hub as the Donbass, remain non-functional. This hurts not only our image, but also our economy, production capacity and the industrial potential of our country.\n\nA number of military officials have suggested that workers' strikes should be suppressed and all factories and plants should be brought back into operation immediately, but such an action would be clearly unpopular, though effective. On the other hand, civilian officials from all parties recommend intensified labor propaganda and declarative labor mobilization."
ukrsoc.14.a: "Get the workers to work!"
ukrsoc.14.b: "Promote labour, not violence!"

ukrsoc.15.t: "The Hetman Bureacracy Question"
ukrsoc.15.d: "One of the controversial decisions that must be made as a matter of urgency is the dismissal of all officials who collaborated with the hetman’s regime. \n\nAlthough many in the Dyrektoria are in favor of full lustration, for some this step seems reckless. We can win over to our side the people who have been managing the country for 20 years instead of arresting or firing them all, because unlike the new government, the old apparatus has real work experience."

ukrsoc.16.d: "Question of the Monarchist Parties"
ukrsoc.16.b: "They should be allowed to exist."

ukrsoc.17.t: "A Discussion of Unions"
ukrsoc.17.d: "Particular attention at the congress was paid to the issue of trade unions. Representatives of numerous trade unions, workers' committees, and committees of factory commissioners came to the congress to vote for the party that best serves the interests of the trade unions and the Ukrainian working class.\n\nThree main programs were put on the agenda. The first, from the Ukapists, offers the unions guarantees of independence from the state, and even participation in economic planning along with the Ministry of National Economy. The second, from the Social Democrats mainly welcomes the self-government of the workers, the development of labor forces and social guarantees for the proletariat. Finally, the third, from the Social Revolutionaries, mainly revolves around the idea of the Labor Republic and the Labor Principle, also assumes the participation of the trade unions in the management of the economy and the \"socialization of factories and enterprises\", that is, the transfer to society and its representatives."
ukrsoc.17.a: "UKP wins the unions’ support"
ukrsoc.17.b: "Trade Unions support USDRP position"
ukrsoc.17.c: "The UPSR\nwins the debate by getting the unions on its side"

ukrsoc.18.t: "Bourgeousie and Landlords"
ukrsoc.18.d: "One of the most heated issues of discussion at the congress was the question of landlords, the bourgeoisie, and the deprivation of their electoral rights. The idea supported by the majority of the parties is the immediate alienation of voting rights from the representatives of the capitalist exploiting classes, who have been robbing the common people for the past 20 years under the patronage of Hetman and the foreign military. \n\nOn the other hand, the democratic and socialist character of our new republic, as if to prevent any oppression on the basis of class, for in this way we are likened to our enemies, who are in any case in the minority."
ukrsoc.18.a: "They should be deprived of electoral rights!"
ukrsoc.18.b: "Universal vote is preferable."

ukrsoc.19.t: "Adoption of the V Universal"
ukrsoc.19.d: "One of the most solemn events at the convention was the adoption of the so-called 5th Universal. The previous four Universals represent important milestones in the history of Ukrainian independence, from the creation of a body of representation of the Ukrainian people, to the adoption of autonomy, and finally to independence. Today's jubilee Universal has consolidated the basic provisions adopted by the delegates of the All-Ukrainian Congress and put an end, at least in words, to the bourgeois capitalist system in Ukraine that flourished under the Hetman regime.\n\nThe 5th Universal once again confirmed the unconditional independence of Ukraine and its peoples, the future is now open, and Ukraine is once again gaining strength to confront future threats."
ukrsoc.19.a: "The Ukrainian People’s Republic lives on!"

ukrsoc.21.t: "The Congress Ends"
ukrsoc.21.d: "With the Congress ending in a couple of days, it is time to elect the new government and premier of the People’s Republic. With the main political issues discusses, the majority of the Congress chooses the mandate of..."
ukrsoc.21.a: "Ukapists, the Ukrainian Communist Party."
ukrsoc.21.b: "Vsevolod Holubovych and his SRs."
ukrsoc.21.c: "Ukrainian Social Democrats with Vynnychenko."
ukrsoc.21.e: "The Socialist-Federalists, surprisingly."
ukrsoc.21.f: "[GetUVOLeader] and Striltsi disband the Congress..."

## Here comes the UKP events ###

ukrsoc.22.t: "Shakhrai and Vynnychenko"
ukrsoc.22.d: "Sitting near the bar table, Shakhrai thinks about all the struggle and decisions that Ukraine awaits, and his role in it.  Bringing the revolution, with Dyrektoria, and with the UKP, getting the party with such different people behind him, he sits to think about all the comrades, who died, fighting against the Whites, the Germans or the Hetmanists. They wouldn’t see what Ukraine will be — the country of the freed proletariat and peasantry, with the human emancipation and cultural renessaince never seen before under the German rule. \nUnexpectedly, the sit near him was taken. He sees the face of the famous writer, politician, the enemy, his political enemy, and, somehow, a pleasant person to speak with in the bar.\n«How it’s going?» — speaks Vynnychenko, starting the long and intresting conversation — a sharp political debate, and a psychological drama, of most famous and important people of Ukrainian politics. After hours of talking, the two started to packing, preparing for another battles of their parties. Feeling the respect to one another, they shaked hands and went to their homes, drunkenly roaming the streets of night Kyiv, only to see each other tomorrow"
ukrsoc.22.a: "Perhaps, a new friendship was born?"

ukrsoc.23.t: "Pan Skoropadskyi ta Tovarish Skorovstanskyi"
ukrsoc.23.d: "Vasyl Shakhrai became known as the People’s Secretary of Military Affairs, one of the authors of the manifesto to the Ukrainian people and one of the leaders of the short-lived Ukrainian People’s Republic of Soviets with its capital in Kharkiv.\n\nSoon after Hetman Skoropadskyi came to power in Kyiv, Shakhrai began writing bantering appeals, signing himself as \"Comrade Skorovstanskyi\", which mocked the Hetman’s last name and hinted that Hetmanist Ukraine was about to rise, but still nothing.\nFor these articles, Shakhrai gained popularity among the common people. Now in power, a new article signed by Comrade Skorovstanskyi was published in the newspaper Molot in which the chauvinistic feudal regime of the Hetman was finally denounced."
ukrsoc.23.a: "Eventually, Hetman got what he deserved"

ukrsoc.24.t: "A Friendly Talk Down Khreshchatyk"
ukrsoc.24.d: "Kyiv was beautiful, as always! There were a lot of people on the streets, busy with their own things, so no one noticed the little bar on Khreshchatyk, the entrance to which was closed. Inside, there was a friendly discussion between Prime Minister Shakhray and the leader of the Ukrainian Social Democrats, Volodymyr Vynnychenko. \n\nThe bar debates become a daily routine for the Vynnychenko and Shakhray, as their favorite place in Kyiv fills up with people, they filling it with political discussions. Vynnychenko, finds a lot of symphaty to the cause of Shakhray, and, it seems, the same goes for his party Left-wing. The idea of unified left party is mentioned briefly by one of them, speaking on the different topic, only a few words, but the idea makes the two to think: what makes us such different after all? With the left seemingly pushing together for a Ukrainian brand of socialism, not compromising class interests of the workers, maybe its a good moment to speak of the united party? Party of all the left, that will represent all the proletariat, not the fraction, and the peasantry too. Vynnychenko and Shakhray will think about this idea all night, overhearing discussions arising in their parties — is it really possible?"
ukrsoc.24.a: "Comrades, is it the time to have a joint congress with the left of USDRP?"
ukrsoc.24.b: "I don’t think its a good idea."

ukrsoc.25.t: "Legacy of Bolshevism"
ukrsoc.25.d: "Mykola Skrypnyk, known as an old Bolshevik among the party, a member of the RSDRP since 1898, also spoke at the congress. Although Skrypnyk expressed hopes of cooperation with the Russian Communists, he very clearly stressed the need for Ukrainian independence and the development of its culture. Skrypnyk declared that Bolshevism is not a curse or the imperialist needs of the great Russian chauvinists, but is the way of the struggle of the proletariat and Ukraine must be freed from the shackles of capital."
ukrsoc.25.a: "Interesting"

ukrsoc.26.t: "The Colonial Problem"
ukrsoc.26.d: "At the congress, one of the prominent figures of the party, its 'left wing', Andriy Richytskyi, gave a report, stating that Ukraine, as a country with a strong tradition of freedom and independence, should lead the anti-colonial struggle of the peoples. In particular, he raised the issue that the Third International does not give a solution to the problem of colonialism and proposes a violent "liberation" from the imperialist shackles of the peoples of Africa. Essentially substituting red imperialism for liberation, the politicians of the Commune cannot offer an effective solution to the colonial question, despite their stated support for the oppressed peoples. It is therefore up to Ukraine, shackled for centuries by three empires, to lead this internationalist struggle."
ukrsoc.26.a: "His words have sense"

ukrsoc.27.t: "Necessity of Ukrainisation"
ukrsoc.27.d: "In his speech, Party Chairman Shakhrai spoke of the need for speedy Ukrainianization and expressed his hopes for an independent Soviet Ukraine. As the creator of the concept of 'national communism', Shakhrai once again stated that the aspiration of the Ukrainian spirit is for Ukrainian independence. He also expressed hopes of creating a unified socialist government and joining a coalition of other socialist parties. Shakhray’s speech was full of optimism and energized the delegates gathered at the congress, many of whom expressed confidence in the course of the party."
ukrsoc.27.a: "Good"

ukrsoc.28.t: "Decision of the IV(I) Congress"
ukrsoc.28.d: "Today in Kyiv was the fourth, but also the first since the Directorate came to power, congress of the Ukrainian Communist Party. During the congress, several prominent delegates gave addresses, and now it will be necessary to adopt the most relevant platform and elect a new party chairman.\n\nIn general, the delegates have three favorites: Andriy Richytskyi and his program of party centralization, economics, and the anti-colonial struggle. Mykola Skrypnyk and his Bolshevist national-oriented program. And also the current chairman, Vasyl Shakhrai and his program of democratic communism and Ukrainianization.\nSoon, the decision of the Congress was announced..."
ukrsoc.28.a: "Richytskyi’s platform was chosen"
ukrsoc.28.b: "Party votes for Skrypnyk"
ukrsoc.28.c: "Shakhrai remains in his position"

ukrsoc.29.t: "The Beginning of Ukrainisation"
ukrsoc.29.d: "Today, along with the reform of education, increased Ukrainianization is beginning. The capitalist and landlord government of Hetman and King failed to organize for 15 years decent conditions for the development of Ukrainian national culture, and now the Communist Party is taking over. Soon the Ukrainian people will be not only the most educated, but also added to their spirit of independence."
ukrsoc.29.a: "Together towards new Ukrainian society!"

ukrsoc.30.t: "Creation of Skrypnykivka"
ukrsoc.30.d: "Today the official spelling of the Ukrainian language, called Skrypnykivka, was adopted by a vote at the All-Ukrainian Spelling Conference. Chairman Skrypnyk personally took part in the creation of the literary spelling, in addition to him, famous Ukrainian linguists and even writers also took part, like Mykola Khvylovyi and Mykola Yalovyi. Linguists from Galicia also took part in the conference.\n\nThe adoption of the new spelling was also responded to in Moscow, where the local government stated that the Ukrainian language is about to be \"artificially separated from the Russian language\". However, the criticism from the Slavic neighbor did not receive much attention, as many linguists on both sides of the argument stated that the language develops naturally and cannot be artificially changed."
ukrsoc.30.a: "Glory to Skrypnykivka"

ukrsoc.31.t: "Ukrainian Futurist Exhibition"
ukrsoc.31.d: "The Ministry of Socialist Enlightenment is ready to organize a world futurist exhibition in Ukraine. The venue was chosen as Kharkiv, a rapidly developing city whose inhabitants would be happy to welcome foreign delegations."

The film organization will produce films on a regular basis, and the process will be managed by administrators of Ukrainian Soviet film production, Pavlo Nechesa and Zakhar Khelmno. Foreign filmmakers are being invited to Ukraine, and French film critic and theorist Leon Mussinac has already expressed his consent. Particular importance is given to cultural films - popular science films for education and upbringing, production films.\n\nIn addition, there are plans to increase the number of cinemas so that Ukrainian people can watch Ukrainian films in Ukrainian, in many cases absolutely free of charge.

ukrsoc.41.t: "Ideologisation of Education"
ukrsoc.41.d: "Along with the educational reform program and the elimination of illiteracy that has unfolded in Ukraine, education will also become ideologized.

ukrsoc.41.a: "Knowledge is Force!"

ukrsoc.42.t: "Letter of Graditude from Vietnam"
ukrsoc.42.d: "Today the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a letter from ordinary peasants and workers in Vietnam who sent their thanks for our government’s help in the anti-colonial struggle of the peoples of Indochina.

ukrsoc.45.t: "The New UKP Organisation"
ukrsoc.45.d: "Today at the party congress, Andriy Richytskyi announced that from now on party members must adhere to a unified party line. Despite criticism from various UKP members, including even the most prominent ones, and accusations of trying to create a cult of personality and substitute authoritarianism for the true democratic spirit of the party, the majority of delegates agreed with Richytskyi’s proposal. In the near future, it seems that we should expect an official campaign to discredit the party’s most vociferous critics."
ukrsoc.45.a: "Follow the general line of the party!"

ukrsoc.46.t: "KB 'Komsomol' Tractors"
ukrsoc.46.d: "The Constructing Bureau 'Komsomol' has presented the new designs of tractors for our peasants. As a part of state-funded mechanization of agriculture, new tractors will be issued to the peasants in several stages, achieving full mechanization of agricultural industry in a few years."
ukrsoc.46.a: "Our great achievement!"

ukrsoc.47.t: "A Record Harvest!"
ukrsoc.47.d: "Thanks to the efforts of our party and the wise leadership of the government and Prime Minister Ritchicki, this year the peasants harvested a record harvest! This is a great achievement for our breadbasket!"
ukrsoc.47.a: "Achievement of Socialism!"

ukrsoc.48.t: "Feeder of the World"
ukrsoc.48.d: "Our efforts were not in vain, and now we can proudly say that we feed the whole world with our bread! However, with such a great achievement comes a great responsibility. Now we can actually control the price of grain, and other countries will have to accept it. The right thing to do would of course be to lower the price of grain for the neediest and poorest countries. By increasing the price of grain for all, we will substantially improve the standard of living of our citizens, sending this money to social needs. At the same time, we can lower the price of grain so that there are as few needy people in the world as possible."
ukrsoc.48.a: "Raise grain prices"
ukrsoc.48.b: "Lower grain prices"
ukrsoc.48.c: "Special price for the third world countries"

ukrsoc.49.t: "Triumph of 'Chervonyi Prapor'"
ukrsoc.49.d: "Today the Central Committee of the Party officially issued a ban on nongovernmental newspapers. According to a summary in the main revolutionary newspaper Chervonyi Prapor, other newspapers express the interests of the petty bourgeoisie and outright enemies of the revolutionary achievements of Richytskyi’s party. "
ukrsoc.49.a: "Only governmental press is allowed!"

### ukrsoc.50-100 reserved for Kyiv Conference ###
ukrsoc.50.t: "Third Internationale & Colonial Problem"
ukrsoc.50.d: "\"The Third International, created by the forces of the syndicalist revolution in Europe, seemed to be the beginning of the World Revolution. A revolution that would free the whole world from the oppression of Imperialism and Colonialism, but what do we see? We see that the governments of socialist Europe are not ready to give an answer to the question of what the world will be like after the liberation of the colonies of world capitalism. The workers and peasants, the dehkans, the poorest people of Africa, Asia and America are in bondage, and the Third International does not give us an answer to the question of what its program on this subject will be. The hypocritical liars in Paris, London, and even Moscow say nothing about small peoples, about colonialism, about the liberation of the proletariat in the whole world, not only in Europe and North America. While the nations dream of freedom, the French government dreams of Alsace, and the socialist parties of Russia dream of restoring the empire. Our party is ready to lead the international struggle, for the liberation of the oppressed of the world. We do not divide territories, we believe that under communism every nation is worthy to remember its history and defend its culture against any globalist superculture. Down with Imperialism! Long live the free world!\""
ukrsoc.50.a: "Internationale provides no solution..."

ukrsoc.51.t: "Organisation of the Kyiv Conference"
ukrsoc.51.d: "In view of the Third Internationale’s inability to solve the colonial question and to present an effective solution to the problem, we must take it upon ourselves to organize a conference of all the powers defending or defending themselves against colonial oppression and sharing our anti-imperialist values."
ukrsoc.51.a: "Send out the invitations"

ukrsoc.52.t: "Invitation to the Kyiv Conference"
ukrsoc.52.d: "The Socialist Government of Ukraine organizes a world conference in Kyiv on international cooperation of anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist powers. We have received an official invitation from the Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs"
ukrsoc.52.a: "We will attend"
ukrsoc.52.b: "What a stupid idea!"

ukrsoc.53.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Delegation Arrives"
ukrsoc.53.d: "The [FROM.GetName] has accepted our invitation to the Conference and their delegation has already arrived to Kyiv."
ukrsoc.53.a: "Splendid!"

ukrsoc.54.t: "Start the Conference"
ukrsoc.54.d: "With the majority of delegations arrived and gathered in Kyiv, it is high time we start our Conference. There are a lot of question to be discussed."
ukrsoc.54.a: "Most important matters should be discussed"

ukrsoc.55.t: "The Left Front Meeting"
ukrsoc.55.d: "Before the start of the main Conference, the leftist countries have gathered to discuss additional issues against colonialism. Richytskyi is willing to support the leftist more, at a cost of influencing the nations under his own vision of Communist thought. The main issue is providing extra help for the proletarians and peasants of the socialist countries, the issue to be decided on now."
ukrsoc.55.a: "So what’s on the list?"

ukrsoc.56.t: "$ukrsoc.55.t$"
ukrsoc.56.d: "Before the start of the main conference, the socialist countries have gathered together as the [FROM.GetLeader] wants to provide extra help for those who fight for peasants and workers. The main issue is if we need extra help from Ukraine or not."
ukrsoc.56.a: "We need extra help!"
ukrsoc.56.b: "We are doing alright!"

ukrsoc.57.t: "[FROM.GetName] Asks for Extra Aid"
ukrsoc.57.d: "When it is time for the [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation to speak, they asked for extra help for their struggle against imperialism."
ukrsoc.57.a: "Provide extra help!"

ukrsoc.58.t: "Economic Cooperation"
ukrsoc.58.d: "The first question to be discussed at the conference is the issue of the economic cooperation. Since the economic development of the countries of Asia, Africa and America is low, thanks to the Imperialist policies, it is important to install economic cooperation on the basis of mutual interest and respect for sovereignity. The member states are supposed to do collective actions to stabilise international prices and demand for resources."
ukrsoc.58.a: "Voting will soon begin..."

ukrsoc.59.t: "Cultural & Research Cooperation"
ukrsoc.59.d: "The development of the cultural cooperation is one of the most powerful measures to increase mutual understanding between our countries. Asia and Africa are the cradles of great religions and civilizations that have enriched other cultures and civilizations in the process of their own enrichment. Consequently, the cultures of Asia and Africa are based on spiritual and common foundations.\n\nMoreover, a research society should be founded in order to share technological advances in our countries."

ukrsoc.60.t: "Human Rights and Self-Determination"
ukrsoc.60.d: "1. The Kyiv Conference declares its full support for the basic principles of human rights. The conference declares its full support for the principle of self-determination of peoples and nations. \n2. The Kyiv Conference condemns the policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination, which are the basis of governmental attitudes and human relations in large parts of Africa and in other parts of the world. Such conduct is not only a gross violation of human rights, but also a denial of the basic values of civilization and human dignity. The Conference expresses its fervent sympathy and support for the courageous stand taken by the victims of racial discrimination; expresses its admiration for those who support their cause; reaffirms the determination of the peoples of Asia, Africa and America to destroy all traces of racism that may still be present in their own countries; and undertakes to use all its moral influence to guard against the danger of falling into the same evil in their struggle to eradicate racism."

ukrsoc.61.t: "Problems of the Dependent Peoples"
ukrsoc.61.d: "1. The Kyiv Conference discussed the problems of dependent peoples, colonialism, and the evils of subjecting peoples to foreign domination and exploitation. The conference agreed: (a) to declare that colonialism in all its manifestations constitutes an evil which must be speedily suppressed; (b) to affirm that the subjection of peoples to foreign subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental human rights and an obstacle to the promotion of international peace and cooperation; (c) to support the cause of freedom and independence of all such peoples; (1) to call upon the countries concerned to grant freedom and independence to such peoples.\n2. In view of the unsettled situation in North Africa and the persistent denial of the right of the peoples of North Africa to self-determination, the Kyiv Conference expresses its support for the rights of the peoples of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to self-determination and independence, and calls upon the French Government to achieve without delay a peaceful settlement of the matter."

ukrsoc.62.t: "Kyiv Conference Demands"
ukrsoc.62.d: "We have received a note of protest from the countries, that gathered at the Kyiv Conference about our 'exploitation of the dependent peoples in North Africa'. They have demanded that we should immediately give them independence and withdraw from their rightful lands."
ukrsoc.62.a: "What nonsense"

ukrsoc.63.t: "Declaration on the Promotion\nof Universal Peace & Cooperation"
ukrsoc.63.d: "Free from mistrust and fear and imbued with trust and goodwill toward one another, countries should tolerate and live in peace with one another as good neighbors and develop friendly cooperation on the basis of the following principles: \n1. Respect for fundamental human rights. \n2. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries. \n3. Recognition of the equality of all races and the equality of all nations, large and small. \n4. Refraining from intervention and interference in the internal affairs of another country. \n5. Respect for the right of each country to defend itself individually or collectively. \n6. (А). Refraining from using collective defense agreements for the private benefit of any of the great powers. (В). The abstention of any country from exerting pressure on other countries. \n7. Refraining from acts or threats of aggression or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any country. \n8. Settlement of all international disputes by peaceful means-such as negotiation, conciliation\n9. Promotion of mutual interests and cooperation. \n10. Respect for justice and international obligations. "

ukrsoc.101.t: "Discrediting Shakhrai Campaign"
ukrsoc.101.d: "Due to the ban on factionalism in the party, one of the Ukapist leaders, Vasyl Shakhrai, soon fell under a campaign of discredit. He was accused of revisionism, imperialism, and collaboration with the opposition parties of the Socialist Revolutionaries and the Social Democrats. In addition, he was also attributed ties with Shumskyi. Shakhrai is no longer mentioned in the press, and his merits are greatly diminished. Moreover, he ceased to be published in Chervonyi Prapor, the main newspaper of the UKP."
ukrsoc.101.a: "Can’t believe he was once our leader!"

ukrsoc.102.t: "The King of Futuroprairies"
ukrsoc.102.d: "Extremely popular among Ukrainians, the futurists challenge all Russian-speaking futurists who imagine themselves as judges and leaders.\n\nIn their vital escapade, Shkurupyi and Semenko wittily appropriated motifs from popular adventure novels (Mein Ried, Fenimore Cooper, Gustave Emar), threatening to scalp the capital’s \"literary generals\" of futurism - thus trying on themselves the role of Ukrainian Indians who rebelled against Russian authorities. It should be noted that on the cover and title page of his first poetry collection "Psychetozy: Vitryna tretia" (Kyiv, 1922) the 19-year-old author attested himself: THE KING OF FUTUROPRAIRIES GEO SHKURUPYI."
ukrsoc.102.a: " Ukraine’s young talents are our pride."

ukrsoc.103.t: "Coalition With UPSR"
ukrsoc.103.d: "The UPSR leadership reacted quite optimistically to the invitation to join the coalition. In addition to being the largest party in the country and having enormous support among the peasantry, their inclusion in the government would also accelerate the land reform planned under the SR’s program of land socialization.\n\nShakhrai warmly welcomed the UPSR delegates to today’s meeting in the government and said that the key to the friendship of the socialist parties is the success of the future of the Ukrainian peasantry and proletariat."
ukrsoc.103.a: "The Left Coalition Forms!"

ukrsoc.104.t: "The Second Largest Party"
ukrsoc.104.d: "Despite our majority, the Borotbyst Party, led by Oleksandr Shumskyi, is still the second largest party in the country after the UPSR. Shumskyi is an extremely outstanding revolutionary and will be ready to lead the crowd. By demonstratively boycotting the All-Ukrainian Congress, we have lost many voices of the Ukrainian people who are ready to take up arms for the triumph of the Borotbysts. \n\nHowever, the Ukapists and the Borotbysts have much in common, and Shumskyi would obviously benefit from becoming our ally. In this connection, Shakhrai addressed an official letter to Shumskyi and an invitation to take the position of minister without portfolio. In addition, we invited the borotbyst to join the left-wing coalition of socialist parties. This offer is very advantageous for Shumskyi, who can join our socialist cabinet painlessly and peacefully."
ukrsoc.104.a: "Let us await for his answer..."

ukrsoc.105.t: "Shumskyi Joins the Coalition"
ukrsoc.105.d: "Today, after the government meeting, Shakhrai returned to his office, where Minister of Agriculture and one of the leaders of the Ukapists, Antin Drahomyretskyi, was waiting for him.\nShumskyi and his representatives, who had jouned a coalition with the Ukapists during the session, were present at the government session for the first time. \n\nShakhrai and Drahomyretskyi discussed some pressing issues and prepared a plan for land reform - in fact, repeating Lenin’s decree on land, that is - the SRs’ Socialization of Land, but later there was a talk of the Borotbysts’ participation in the work of the government.\nDrahomyretskyi only took off his glasses, looked at the prime minister and said:"
ukrsoc.105.a: "\"In my opinion it was obvious that he would agree.\""

ukrsoc.106.t: "The 'Molot' Newspaper"
ukrsoc.106.d: "Today the first issue of the new government newspaper, the \"Hammer\" or the \"Molot\", came out. In fact, the paper is all propaganda for the Ukapists and their achievements and promises. In addition, the paper also contains criticism of other Reds, mainly of the Borotbysts and the national-traitors of the \"Ukrainian\" Bolsheviks who are abroad.\n\nAlthough people are generally happy with the paper, there are those who have begun to criticize Shakhrai for being authoritarian and propagandizing his ideas. On the other hand, this is not a crime, is it?"
ukrsoc.106.a: "The new mouthpiece of communism!"

ukrsoc.107.t: "Shift in Mass Perceptions"
ukrsoc.107.d: "With the entry of the Borotbysts into the coalition and their regular criticism in the 'Molot', the masses began to drift away from Shumskyi’s influence. Recently, in the local Radas, more and more former Borotbyst supporters openly referred to themselves as Ukapists. It is quite expected that the Ukapists will have a clear majority in the next local council elections. \n\nIt is unknown how Shumskyi himself will react to this, but the main thing is that the masses are coming over to our side, strengthening our united socialist front and bringing Ukraine closer to communism."
ukrsoc.107.a: "Towards victory!"

ukrsoc.108.t: "Decree On Land"
ukrsoc.108.d: "Today, after months and even years of waiting, Ukrainian peasants are free masters of their land. Thanks to a government decree on the socialization of landed estates and their transfer to local land councils, there will be no more inequality in Ukraine. \n\nPeasants! Chase away the capitalists, landlords, bourgeoisie, and foreign gentry. From now on, you will dispose of your land yourselves"
ukrsoc.108.a: "Final liberation of peasants!"

ukrsoc.109.t: "Ukrainian Marxist Congress"
ukrsoc.109.d: "The members of the UKP and the USDRP gave the green light for the Marxist Congress. Today, in Kyiv there will be the first congress of Ukrainian marxists. Nothing will be decided on this event, it has only advisory role, but this kind of cooperation is still highly symbolic. Main invitations were sent to the prominent members of UKP and USDRP, as well as their youth wings. Members of other coalition parties were invited too — but not in that scale. It was a marxist event, and a really important one. With speeches, discussions, ecen fights, the people grew united. The left of the UKP and the Right of USDRP cannot stand each other and either tried to ignore, or, opposite, engage in all the discussions. \n\nAfter all, the congress mood was decided by the youth wings, who pushed a statement, noncommital one, but still powerful, which proclaimed: «The worker’s parties of the UKP and USDRP are looking forward to closest cooperation of all socialist forces against reaction, capitalism and all forms of imperialism brickering. In this regard, such conferences should continue, widening its base to other socialist parties, striving for uniting a revolutionary democracy in one struggle — a class struggle against the rulling classes and for the victory of world revolution». While for the Right wing presented such speech was wishful thinking, and for the left — a compromise with petit-bourgoise, but for the most people it was a start."
ukrsoc.109.a: "Interesting"

ukrsoc.110.t: "Advisory Center of Revolutionary Democracy"
ukrsoc.110.d: "The complete unification of revolutionary parties appeared to be a mere idealistic thought than a reality. Such unification threatened a split — and even in the form of UKP-USDRP unification, serious obstacles appeared, mostly from the right and the left of the parties, which practically sabotaged such process. But it wasnt useless nonetheless. A proposal seems to passed through the coalition’s parties — creation of the so-called «advisory center of revolutionary democracy» — an elected group of representatives of all the coalition parties, practically powerless and only formal, but at the same time being a collective organ beyond all the individual parties — as a show of commitment to the coalition. Such center could be looked at as some, very vague form of confederative party unification and used for coordination of revolutionary actions. If created, it could be the first step for the one and only Ukrainian Socialist Party."
ukrsoc.110.a: "Approve the formation of such center"
ukrsoc.110.b: "Block it. UKP should not be united with petty-bourgouise philisters!"

ukrsoc.111.t: "Close Ties With Bolsheviks"
ukrsoc.111.d.nsp: "Even though the government in power in Russia is trying to distance itself from the fact that they are Bolsheviks, it does not change that fact. Nikolai Bukharin, in many ways the more democratic proponent of socialism and propagandist of his model of market socialism, is in fact the very real Bolshevik and a longtime acquaintance of Skrypnyk.\n\nIn this connection, the government today sent a delegation to Soviet Russia with the hope of concluding a friendly alliance on independent terms. "
ukrsoc.111.d: "The Socialist Revolution has triumphed in Russia and the Bolsheviks, led by [RUS.GetLeader], are once again in the forefront of Soviet Russian politics. As longtime acquaintances of the Russian leader, Skrypnyk would be happy to strike a lucrative deal.\n\nIn this connection, the government today sent a delegation to Soviet Russia with the hope of concluding a friendly alliance on independent terms.

ukrsoc.115.t: "Russia Refused!"
ukrsoc.115.d: "Despite close relations between our leaders, it seems that Russia follows a bit different policy, if talking about Ukrainian independence. With stupid accusation of nationalism, the Russian government has refused any cooperation."

ukrsoc.124.t: "The Land Issue"
ukrsoc.124.d: "The issue of land reform is one of the hottest topics of discussion at the Party Congress. Moreover, the options for resolving this problem are plentiful, but delegates have not yet been able to agree.\n\nThe Centrists’ plan is the municipalization of land, which implies the transfer of land into the hands of local councils, which will then distribute it among the peasants. \n\nThere is also a proposal to divide the land according to 'who can cultivate how much' and the same division, but with a declared minimum of 50 hectares. Smaller lands would have to be divided among the peasants.\n\nThe left faction advocated a Narodnik land reform - that is, its socialization, transferring it into the hands of all the Ukrainian peasants. Large farms are to be preserved and production cooperatives to be created on their basis.\n\nSo far, the final choice has not been made, but by the end of the week the Central Committee of the USDRP intends to make a final decision..."

ukrsoc.125.d: "The Otaman of the Army, Symon Petliura, member of the Dyrektoria and one of the key figures in the USDRP is now seen by the government as a threat to the People’s Democracy in Ukraine.\n\nFaction of his supporters also grows in number, making his voice significant. This situation is not preferable for the majority of the USDRP Central Committee, who see Petliura as a warmonger and a careerist. Dissatisfaction with Petliura has already reached such a stage that the Central Committee is ready to vote to expel him from the party, but some have spoken out against such a decision and suggest that he simply be relegated to a second echelon of politics by removing him from office. With a slight majority, the Central Committee votes for..."

ukrsoc.1250.t: "140 Attempts"
ukrsoc.1250.d: "Some people have reported to other certain people that more than 140 attempts have been made on General Petliura's life and health in the last few months, but none of them have been successful. Each time, almost miraculously, the general was completely unharmed and unscathed. \n\nAlthough we might suspect some people of unprofessionalism, we can be certain that they are experts in their field. In turn, some people have applied for additional funding for their highly secretive activities, but we have the final word."
ukrsoc.1250.a: "Increase funding!"
ukrsoc.1250.b: "They should just try better!"

ukrsoc.1251.t: "Planning the Accident"
ukrsoc.1251.d: "In a fairly ordinary apartment not far from the center of Kyiv, some citizens were sitting around and were clearly up to something. If the neighbor had been nosy enough, he probably, with the proper dexterity, could have overheard the conversation. And some people were talking about the following: how to kill General Petliura. To kill him so that he would not die. More precisely, how to plan the accident in such a way that the general would stay alive? Creating an appearance of work and deep conversation, for several days and nights some people had been planning how to commit murder without committing murder so that they would not be suspected of it. On the table a fair amount of Hryvnias were lying, received from important people, noticeably smaller than it had been in that very briefcase at the Ministry...\n\nThe answer was still not forthcoming, but surely it had already matured in the mind of one of the 'some men' and would soon be announced..."
ukrsoc.1251.a: "Hopefully they will find the answer eventually"

ukrsoc.126.t: "Subordinating the Army"
ukrsoc.126.d: "Even after the previous decision, Petliura stays as the Otaman of the Army, and so the dissatisfaction with our government in the UNR Army and among the General Staff increased greatly.\n\nSome of the USDRP members suggest that Petliura should retire from Army - the decision, which is supported by the majority of the Central Committee. However, the leftists see the whole Petliurivtsi faction as dangerous for democracy and suggest to dismiss them all.\n\nThe Central Committee should make its decision till the end of the day."

However, different factions had a different approach to this.\n\nThus, the leftists propose to nationalize everything in general - the abolition of private property, especially the alienation from the landlords and the bourgeoisie of the sources of their capital is seen as obligatory and immutable. However, this would cause great unrest in the Western powers, especially in Germany and Austria.\n\nThe centrists have taken a more moderate position, proposing that all enterprises and productions owned by Ukrainians should be left in private hands, including the medium-sized industry, and that foreign companies should be nationalized in exchange for concessions. \n\nThe rightists, on the other hand, are ready to compromise and leave some areas in private hands, especially where state control may be ineffective, such as small businesses, which are supposed to be taxed."

ukrsoc.128.t: "The Question of Concessions"
ukrsoc.128.d: "With the nationalization of the foreign assets, the question of their concessions is now very important. On the one hand, the nationalization requires some compensation from us, or else the foreign powers will consider it as requisition. On the other hand, in return for their investments, the foreign capitalists will receive superprofits due to the mostly fixed prices."

However, they are now asking for concessions - so that we can invest in our former industries and get profit. However, some conservative members in our government are strongly opposed to doing so and require us to boycott the socialist Ukraine’s offer and demand compensation!"

ukrsoc.137.t: "Hell of Resignations"
ukrsoc.137.d: "With the left-wing of USDRP dominant and party program adopting thesises of democratic dictatorship of proletariat and a transition of power to soviets, a series of resignation happened, severely weakening the party and its image.\n\nIn this chaos, Panas Fedenko and Isaac Masepa left the office in protest, saying that «we cannot give revolutionary democracy only limited extend — to the Soviets». With them gone, party balance crumbles and important positions in the government and in party are now missing.\n\nIn this demarché, Fedenko and Masepa openned newspaper «Novyi Chas» — as a clear reference to «Neue Zeit» of Karl Kautsky, having the ambition to give platform for the center and right, and even anti-soviet left of the party to speak from «social-democratic opposition» against communist tendencies of USDRP.\n\nWith the opposition strengthening and actions taken, the government grabs their chance to use this chaos to their advantage — bringing new candidacies and preparing reforms — achieving popular support and truly, the mandate of the people, trying to knock the ground out from under opposition’s feet"
ukrsoc.137.a: "Consolidate the government, we cannot split the party for a second time!"

ukrsoc.138.t: "Cultural-Personal National Autonomy"
ukrsoc.138.d: "The Ukrainian Social Democratic Party professes the ideal of national cultural-personal autonomy. First formulated by Otto Bauer in 1907, it remains the prevailing ethnic policy of the Austro-Marxist movement, from which the USDRP borrows most of its ideas - it seeks to turn the nation not into a territorial and ethnic entity, but into a simple association of people, separating the state from its territory. After all, what does it say about being Ukrainian that you have to live in this particular section of Europe and follow a certain set of traditions? If you consider yourself Ukrainian, have Ukrainian citizenship, and contribute to the country - through taxes or other means - what prevents you from being considered Ukrainian?\n\nMany Jewish Bundist ideologues held a similar view, which turned the Social Democrats and the Bundists into natural allies. During its term, the Social Democrat government would seek significant reforms to achieve its ideal of National Cultural and Personal Autonomy. Every ethnic group in Ukraine would have their own universal cultural assemblies, able to levy their own taxes and autonomously decide matters concerning their members. Every citizen of Ukraine would belong to one of these cultural assemblies, but the question of which national movement to join would be a matter of personal choice, and no government would control the decision."

ukrsoc.139.t: "Jewish Cultural Autonomy Elections"
ukrsoc.139.d: "The idea of national personal autonomy suggests that the state should interfere in cultural and ethnic affairs as little as possible, and instead transfer power in these areas to autonomous communities that have no territory but are a community or syndicate of people who associate themselves with a given ethnic group by choice. These autonomous ethnic communities could levy their own taxes, create their own educational programs, and, of course, elect their own leadership.\n\nToday, the cultural autonomy of Ukrainian Jews holds elections. Although outwardly dominated by the Jewish Workers’ Bund (in alliance with the USDRP) and its electoral lists, the Jewish community of Ukraine is very ideologically diverse, and although socialism is prominent among them, the Achdus religious party has suddenly gained an advantage in a number of polls. The election results will undoubtedly define Jewish cultural autonomy for years to come, and..."

These autonomous ethnic communities could levy their own taxes, create their own educational programs, and, of course, elect their own leadership.\n\nToday, the cultural autonomy of Crimean Tatars holds elections. With Crimean separatism still quite active, the Qırımtatarlar Beysezlege Echen Partiya (Party for Crimean Tatar Independence), a radical nationalist organisation, mostly consisted of young Crimean Tatars struggles to win against Milliy Fırqa (National Party). However, they still have a chance due to the split in the main Crimean Tatar party: two candidates are struggling for victory. The first is Seidamet Jafer, an ideologue and one of the leaders of the Crimean Tatar people in the initial period of the Civil War, Minister of War and Minister of Foreign Affairs in the first government of the national hero of Crimea N. Celebijikhan and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Crimean Regional Government of Sulkevich, until the resignation of the latter.\nThe second is Amet Ozenbashly, a candidate with a socialist bias in his views. He participated in the negotiations between the government of Sulkevich and the Hetman in 1918, and then did not emigrate and in 1920 became one of the founders of the agricultural organization "Shirket", which had branches in all regions of the Crimea. In addition, he became a member of the organization "Koch Yardim" ("Assistance to migrants"), which aimed to create favorable conditions for the return of Crimean Tatars from Turkey and the Bulgarian Tsardom."

ukrsoc.1400.d: "With the cultural-personal national autonomies act passed, a lot of various social-democratic organisation and parties of local peoples have been founded in Ukraine. Some of the most popular and widespread ones are the \"Social-Democratic Labour Party of the Crimean Tatars\" and \"Party of Ukrainian Romy\". While some deputies of the Rada claim that the local representation in the government and parliament is not enough, this is not the main case of the national-personal autonomies.\n\nHowever, the government is now faced with several decisions to make: either establish a 'Confederation' of Social-Democratic parties in Ukraine, which will likely include the Jewish Bund, invite Roma and Crimean Tatar social-democrats in the ruling coalition, or just simply leave everything as it is for the sake of socialist democracy."

ukrsoc.141.d: "For the better part of modern history, Ukraine has been under the thumb of a foreign power. Be it the Russians, Poles, or Germans, we have had little to no chance for our culture to thrive. This has not been helped by period of Russifaction and other such attempts to strip our nation of it’s uniqueness. This shall stand no longer! Under the people’s government, our culture will thrive. Be it promotion of events featuring famous works of art, state sponsored food expos, or funding the arts in general, we shall not rest until Ukraine’s culture is revived! While this may draw the ire of Russiphiles in the East and the Poles in the west, we know our cause is just. Ukraine shall be a phoenix from the ashes, rising to meet the culture challenges of the modern day."
ukrsoc.141.a: "One step closer towards our goal."

ukrsoc.142.t: "Jewish Labour Bund"
ukrsoc.142.d: "The Jewish Labour Bund has a long story of cooperation with Ukrainian Social Democracy. Although on some issues the opinions of the Bund were different from the Ukrainian ones, since the Hetmanist government banned and prevented any Bundas activities, Dyrektoria became a natural ally of socialist Jewish organisation.\n\nWith the establishement of the People’s Republic, the Bund has returned to Ukraine and took part in organising the Bundas - Jewish trade unions. Although the Bundas are trade unions, they are being organised by Jews, and for Jews alone. While the left generally approve of the Bundas autonomy, the rightists believe that a central trade union under joint USDRP-Bund authority should be created. This will help us to get our parties closer to each other and prevent any misunderstandings with the local Bundas."
ukrsoc.142.a: "Leave the Bundas alone."
ukrsoc.142.b: "A united USDRP-Bund organisation of trade unions."

ukrsoc.143.t: "Derzhavnyi Bank & Cooperation"
ukrsoc.143.d: "The Ukrainian Central Rada established the Derzhavnyi Bank back in 1917, but Hetman had to create the Ukrainian Derzhavnyi Bank, in fact, anew. It was Hetman’s Minister of Finance Rzhepetskyi who was one of the \"architects\" of the Derzhavnyi Bank in its present form.\n\nWith the coming of the Dyrektoria to power, the Derzhavnyi Bank proved to be a strong body, which could control private banks and cooperation, and in fact attach them to itself at the expense of lending activities.\n\nNow many banks are still private and in the hands of capitalists, especially the cooperative banks, which are engaged in credit activities for farmers and peasants. Nevertheless, we can use the Derzhavnyi Bank to increase control over private banks. In fact, the government proposes to nationalize the banks - but to give them directly to the Derzhavnyi Bank."

ukrsoc.144.t: "Bankruptcy of Poltava Silskoop Bank"
ukrsoc.144.d: "Due to the recent nationalization of Banks, the Poltava Village Cooperative Bank claimed its bankruptcy, leaving about a thousand depositors without their money. Spontaneous protests by deceived depositors emerged, who blamed the repressive impact of the Derzhavnyi Bank, which set a high interest rate for credit loans. Local Poltava councils have already stated the need to support depositors, and have asked the government directly to address the situation and subsidize farms and khutors in Poltavshchyna.\n\nThe government’s response has not yet been received, but it is clear to many that the Derzhavnyi Bank needs to be restricted, and probably set a maximum interest rate."
ukrsoc.144.a: "The issue of depositors will be resolved."

ukrsoc.145.t: "Fight For Kherson"
ukrsoc.145.d: "After strengthening the power of municipal councils, it was decided to hold new elections in Kherson. The rural region faced an almost deadlocked situation for the first time: the traditional majority of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the relatively recent coalition of the USDRP-leftists and Ukapists were fighting head-to-head for the Kherson Local Rada. \n\nDespite the great support for the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Kherson has recently begun to develop actively, and industrialization has begun in the city, which has caused a sharp influx of the working population.\n\nAccording to pre-election polls, the coalition of the UKP and the leftists of the USDRP has caught up with the SRs in less than 2 months and now they are keeping up. The results of these elections will probably change not only Kherson, but the entire surrounding region."
ukrsoc.145.a: "UPSR retains its majority."
ukrsoc.145.b: "UKP-USDRP coalition eventually wins."

ukrsoc.146.t: "Rumors of a Coalition With the Ukapists" 
ukrsoc.146.d: "Yesterday many Ukrainian newspapers carried an interesting news item with a headline about possible negotiations between the ruling Social Democrats and the Ukapists. The new course adopted by the USDRP brought them closer to former co-partisans who had left the party as a result of a split 20 years earlier. \n\nWhile many were wondering whether the rumors were the real facts or another conjecture of imaginative journalists, the Rada of People’s Ministers announced the appointment of Ukapist ministers to a number of posts."
ukrsoc.146.a: "Interesting"

ukrsoc.147.t: "USDRP-UKP Coalition Announced!"
ukrsoc.147.d: "The USDRP and the UKP have worked together a great deal recently, despite the absence of an official coalition. In some local council elections, the Ukapists preferred to unite with the leftist USDRP in a single electoral bloc and successfully won seats in this way. \n\nToday, during a speech in parliament, the leader of the Ukapists, Vasyl Shakhrai, announced that a coalition government would be formed and that his party would enter parliament on an official basis. Thus, one of the prominent UKP members, Mykhailo Tkachenko, was appointed as the new Minister of Internal Affairs. \n\nThe changes in the government caused a mixed reaction among some members of the USDRP, especially right-wing members, who condemned the decision of the Central Committee and the government. There were even claims that the USDRP had finally descended into Bolshevism."
ukrsoc.147.a: "Ukrainian Social-Democrats unite once again."

ukrsoc.148.t: "A Single Party?"
ukrsoc.148.d: "After the announcement of the official coalition between the Social Democrats and the Ukapists, the parties became even closer to each other. Their fundamental differences that had led to the splits were now less significant, and so there was talk among high-ranking officials of uniting the two parties - or rather, of reuniting them.\n\nDespite the fact that unification would in no way change the current state of affairs, the USDRP should expect a split from the other side - from the right-wing Social Democrats, who are very negative about the prospect of becoming a single party with the former 'Nezalezhniki'.\n\nThe fundamental question now is the name of the future party. On the one hand, the Social Democrats insist on retaining the current name with the prefix 'united' - to show the essence of the new party. On the other hand, the Ukapists insist that the new party be called the UKP, in honor of our intentions and ultimate goal."
ukrsoc.148.a: "USDRP(o) - don’t forget who we are."
ukrsoc.148.b: "UKP - towards our future."

ukrsoc.149.t: "Another Split?"
ukrsoc.149.d: "The unification of the USDRP with the Ukapists caused a number of problems within the new party. Politicians from among the \"right-wing\" Social-Democrats reacted negatively not only to the merger but also to the new name of the party. At first this fundamental contradiction was suppressed by speeches and convictions about party unity, but toward the end the influence of the Left became too strong. \n\nConsequently, a number of politicians announced their withdrawal from the party and announced an opposition coalition to the new government. Their main partner in this endeavor was the PULD(s-f). The opposition stated that the new course of Ukraine would lead the country to ruin and called on the other parties to join them and change the government democratically."
ukrsoc.149.a: "Unity is what Ukraine needs, not schism!"

ukrsoc.150.t: "Great Constuctions..."
ukrsoc.150.d: "The idea of a Red Kyiv swept the minds of socialist intellectuals throughout Ukraine, and a new project was proposed - supporters began calling it "The Great Buildings of Kyiv" - a project of major redevelopment of Kyiv, including monumental architecture, skyscrapers and cultural squares that would be filled with public space with unique designs by the best architects and artists throughout Ukraine.\n\nThe new project looks set to double the size of Kyiv, creating a massive increase in new jobs and living standards in the city. It also involves the use of modern and even experimental technologies.\n\nThe city’s new plans radically increase spending on cultural spaces, architecture, public transportation, and parks, but everything comes at a price. This massive budgetary pressure will not go unnoticed - it requires tax increases for peasants and budget cuts for other regions, which is sure to anger many."

ukrsoc.151.t: "Green City"
ukrsoc.151.d: "The vision between Red Kyiv is a modern and radical one of the misto-sad, a city which mends the schism between citizens and nature and to this, Kyiv aspires to be the new city never seen before. Financing green projects became an important part of the Red Kyiv project — with even Vynnychenko lobbying for “naturalization” of the city to realize his concordist vision — of people harmonized with nature. New parks. lakes, green roofs, vineyards hanging on the streets, Kyiv ressembles a city of futurism.\n\nMunicipality of the city put in a lot of work to make this vision a reality, but such projects appeared to be too ambitious for the city to hold in normal conditions. In serious discussion, the city council decided to announce a referendum about labour mobilizations — as it is the only way for the plan to be done without overextending the budget. While the population seems rather optimistic and is ready to work harder than ever before, such an approach sparks a lot of controversies in the city council..."
ukrsoc.151.a: "Law about labour mobilization is passed and referendum is scheduled"

ukrsoc.151.c: "Reject the idea"

ukrsoc.152.t: "Peasant Strikes!"
ukrsoc.152.d: "Seemingly endless increases in spending in Kyiv lied as a burden for peasantry in adjusted regions. After the revolution, optimistic peasants showed the immense rise of productivity and were the main forces for Ukrainian modernisation. But now all of this hard work did not return to farms and villages — but in Kyiv. Such regional exceptionality moved the peasants in the opposition and forced UPSR to adopt harsher stances to our government. The first peasant strike from the time of revolution, and a really dangerous one — if we won’t do something, Kyiv will see famine and shortages..."

ukrsoc.153.t: "Elections to the Kyiv Rada"
ukrsoc.153.d: "Soon after the strengthening of the powers of municipal councils, many regions of the country began to prepare for local elections. The most active election campaign was inextricably linked with the capital of our republic - the city of Kyiv. In the first years of the UNR, the head of the city was lawyer Riabtsov Yevhen from the Socialist Revolutionary Party, until he was removed from his post by the Hetman government, which put Karl Marshalk, in his place.\n\nWhen the Dyrektoria came to power, the Kyiv Rada was dissolved until the All-Ukrainian Congress was convened. Now the right to govern the city is being fought over again - and this time, the contender for the position of Kyiv mayor is Volodymyr Chekhivskyi, a native of Kyiv Governorate, and together with his team of SDs is ready to radically transform the city, making it the proletarian capital of Europe. \n\nThe capital was greeted with a resounding victory for the Social Democrats - with an almost 40-percent margin, Chekhivskyi’s bloc came out on top, taking an honorable majority in the local council. Now the city was under the rule of the USDRP, and modernization, greening, and other ambitious projects awaited it."

ukrsoc.154.t: "Ukrainian Freudo-Marxist Studies"
ukrsoc.154.d: "Under the social-democratic rule and prosperity which it brought to Ukraine, a lot of new modernist studies emerged — new universities and conferences along with seemingly endless scientific discussions on all the topics possible — scientific and cultural life is blooming.\n\nWith such renaissance, under the influence and personal interest of Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Ukraine became home of the first systematic state-financed study of psychoanalysis and marxism. As Vynnychenko said once: “If Freud knew about Concordism, he should have immediately become a member of social-democratic party”. To be at the helm of marxist, socialist and psychoanalytical discussions, first “Freudo-marxist studies” were established. However, not limited to Freud and Marx, they gave a new framework for combining social liberation with psychological and individual one.\n\nNew studies gathered psychoanalytics and theoretics around the world, and all the people around the world, especially from Third Internationale countries visiting the city to listen to such people as Otto Fenichel, Wilhelm Reich and Erich Fromm to give birth of what would be called as “Kyiv school of psychoanalysis”"

In many ways he became one of the founders of the movement for Ukrainian autonomism, because he believed that salvation for Ukrainians lies in the creation of their own state, the Union for the defense of themselves against outsiders. He also made a great contribution to the ideological basis of the USDRP - federalism, the basis of which is local self-government, as well as seriously defended the principles of political rights and human freedoms. \n\nDrahomaniv is remembered and loved in Ukraine and his legacy will live on.

ukrsoc.161.t: "Hrushevskyi's Long-Awaited Speech"
ukrsoc.161.d: "Hrushevskyi, one of the most important persons of Ukrainian revolution in 1917 — respected among most of Ukrainians as a father figure for the whole Ukrainian movement, and hated by the nationalists for alleged mismanagement and ‘too democratic’ way of governance. Now, history gives its most passionate actor, the historian himself, a second chance. Again, as ten years before, Hrushevskyi stands among the hundreds of thousand people, waving Ukrainian and red flags...\n\nTo the people of Ukraine, a nation of free, on the land of free, revolutionary greetings! To all the brave heroes, who died fighting for freedom and liberty, we are now standing, united and free! Not tsarist chains, german bayonets or Hetman’s police broke us! Today, the republic stands firmly. With laboring peoples standing and its helm — and first, from 1917, ready to decide their destiny! From now on, Ukraine will be free from landlords, dictators and tsars — either German, Austrian or Russian, with the trust of people backing the UPSR. We are announcing the start of realization of our program, and the most important, land reform.\nLong applause and shouting were heard all over the street. Hope was reborn in the people, and for days after everyone was waiting — will the government deliver on their promises? Is Ukraine really free, is it really, a reality? Even skeptical nationalists were moved by mass support given for Hrushevskyi and UPSR and limited their criticism for a time. Now, everyone was waiting, what would happen next.

ukrsoc.165.d: "Suddenly, for many, the question was raised at the Central Committee Congress about the evaluation of Holubovych's actions as prime minister of Ukraine in 1918. The notoriety lingering behind the prime minister continues to generate a host of rumors and accusations, and for many, the very fact that Holubovych is once again prime minister is rather wild and inappropriate. \n\nThe fact is that it was under Holubovych's government that Skoropadskyi's armed coup took place in 1918, and it was Holubovych's government that allowed the occupation of the UNR by Austrian-German troops. The opposition to the Prime Minister demands the earliest possible consideration of this matter and the formulation of a resolution on the Party's attitude toward this incident, as well as, presumably, a vote of no confidence to the government and the Prime Minister."
ukrsoc.165.a: "The Central Committee should react..."

ukrsoc.166.t: "Holubovych's Competence Is Called Into Question"
ukrsoc.166.d: "The question raised recently about Holubovych's competence in the role of prime minister was considered today at a meeting of the Central Committee. Although a number of members, including Holubovych himself, spoke in his defense and pointed out that the prime minister had served time in the prison of the repressive and anti-socialist Hetman regime, many of the prominent leaders spoke out against his appointment as prime minister, declaring an unequivocal betrayal of the country's interests. Be that as it may, at a general vote of the Central Committee this question will be decided once and for all. Thus, the Central Committee..."

ukrsoc.168.t: "The New SR Program"
ukrsoc.168.d: "With the election of [ROOT.GetLeader] not only as prime minister, but also as head of the Central Committee of the party, the issue of adopting a new program of the UPSR became particularly acute. For a long time, it contained too many slogans and required adaptation to the current political situation. The main debate is between the adoption of the Soviet platform - that is, the traditional doctrine of populism - and the adoption of a dualist platform - the recognition of both councils and parliament as important and entitled institutions. However, without the approval of the leader of the Central Committee, a radical decision to switch to a Soviet platform is impossible."

ukrsoc.169.d: "Probably the most massive of all the Narodist movements, the Russian PSR, under the leadership of Chernov, is undoubtedly one of our key ideological allies. However, much of our cooperation is tied to Russia's foreign policy doctrine, which is clearly enveloped by revanchist sentiments and resentment. The question of cooperation between Ukrainian and Russian SRs is again relevant, and we need to resolve this dilemma at an extraordinary congress of the Party Central Committee."

ukrsoc.170.t: "Crimean Tatar SR Movement"
ukrsoc.170.d: "The Socialist Revolutionary Movement is quite popular in the Crimea. Practically the only functioning party of the Crimean Tatars, Milliy Fırqa, was founded by the Narodniks and has a platform of rather socialist orientation. However, in addition to Milliy Fırqa, there is also a local regional branch of the UPSR led by Abram Derman in the region. Ethnically he does not belong to the Crimean Tatars, but he lived and worked in Simferopol since 1907. During the revolution, he was a member of the Rada of People's Representatives of the Taurian Province and was the secretary of the editorial board of the magazine \"Crimean Cooperator\". In any case, the government intends to direct additional grants to the development of Crimea and to cooperate with both the Milliy Fırqa and the Tavrian section of the UPSR."

The most radical option among those proposed is half the seats, but many are strongly opposed to such a development, saying that this could put us at a disadvantage and suggesting more optimal options: 40 or 30 percent."

The new composition of the government should be approved in the near future by the Rada, which is expected to show solidarity with the prime minister's decision.

The congress was marked by the close attention of the press and marked the reunion of essentially two wings of one party and a joint meeting for the first time since 1918.\n\nA new party program was adopted at the congress, which included a number of Marxist theses, and a new party name was adopted to mark the unity."

ukrsoc.180.d: "Along with the change in the course of the Borotbyst Party to support the current government, we gradually began to win back the urban electorate from the Social Democrats and Ukapists. The proletarian masses increasingly turned away from the UKP and the USDRP in favor of a truly popular party of Socialist-Revolutionaries.

Today, the newspapers reported on a small village, fully controlled by UPSR militia fighting low-scale battles against their fellow party-members from UPSR(b). The question arose: what for? Socialists, Ukrainians, even from the same party, are drawing bayonets against each other. After days of fighting, one side, we don’t know which side of the barricades, started to sing Marseillaise in Ukrainian — and the whole barricades followed, inviting each other to join them. After discussion, soldiers and peasants decided that Ukraine doesn’t deserve another bloody civil war. They created a joint Committee with officers, village heads and party leaders in the region to declare that from now on, they are done with fighting. Village will be neutral, governed by a united UPSR.\n\nSoon, the other villages and soldiers joined. Not seeing the sense and not understanding the reason for fighting, armies started to bond and take a neutral stance or completely desert. With the growing inter-ethnic violence, raids and anarchy spreading, some soldiers decided to return to their home and secure the order, while completely ignoring both mobilizations by UPR and Borotbysts."

### Borotbysts events ###

ukrsoc.190.t: "Street Shootings"
ukrsoc.190.d: "Today the residents of a small town in a seemingly prosperous region of Ukraine were greatly alarmed by the shooting that began in the center of town! Squads of the Chervona Hvardiia of the Borotbysts invaded the city limits in order to seize power in yet another settlement and overthrow the local administration, by the way, elected by the population. The local Militia officers who were in the town were taken by surprise, and as a result of this daring attack, gunfire erupted within the town limits. A reinforced group of the People's Army had already rushed to the scene, but witnesses reported dead and wounded. The anger of the inhabitants is directed not only at the rebels, but also at the government, which is unable to protect them."
ukrsoc.191.t: "Mass Expropriations!"
ukrsoc.191.d: "The announced land reform led disgruntled Borotbyst rebels to call for mass expropriations of the country's land fund. Although in recent years the number of smallholders and Khutors in Ukraine has grown, ordinary peasants have not yet forgotten the large landowners' domination and bourgeois lawlessness. Borotbysts, with their support, promote the ideas of unfair distribution that our party has promoted and demand the liquidation of kulak and farms and expropriation in favor of \"Free People's Land Use\", whatever that means. In fact, the robbed farmers are trying to go to the local courts, but without proper government attention, even legal procedures cannot protect them."
ukrsoc.192.t: "Bourgeousie Flees the Country!"
ukrsoc.192.d: "The sabotage by the Borotbysts and their henchmen among the working class and the peasantry has led to trepidation and unrest not only among ordinary townspeople and workers, but also among less pleasant individuals - the remaining bourgeoisie, usually petty, who have not yet been reached by the Red Hand of the proletariat, are fleeing the country en masse. This, of course, would be to the advantage of our government, if it were not for the capital, the large sums of money and savings they are dragging behind them. Greedy to the penny, merchants and landowners take what they can get away with, enriching neighboring countries. The Borotbysts, at the same time, rejoice, celebrating the victory of the "true people's power\"."
ukrsoc.193.t: "Railway Bombing!"
ukrsoc.193.d: "Today, residents along the Kharkiv-Yuzivka railroad woke up in the middle of the night to a loud explosion and a cloud of smoke. Apparently, the Borotbysts rebels struck quickly in the dark and just as quickly fled into the Wild Steppe. The reason for their attack is obvious: the Kharkiv-Yuzivka railway line plays a key role in supplying the People's Army with equipment, and without them our troops will have difficulty with food and ammunition. Although we will send recovery brigades to get our trains up and running more quickly, the latest attack reflects the increasingly violent nature of the insurgency. We will make sure that when we find them, they pay for their crimes."
ukrsoc.194.t: "Industry Plant Sabotage!"
ukrsoc.194.d: "This morning the residents of Odessa awoke to a terrifying sight and sound: A bomb exploded at a factory, killing several people and injuring dozens more. The bomb severely damaged the plant as well as the local infrastructure. The responsibility for the attack was claimed by none other than the Borotbysts, who claimed that the attack was aimed at businesses in Transnistria belonging to a businessman loyal to the government. Although the reaction of local firefighters and police is admirable, many locals are extremely alarmed, and some even accuse the Ukrainian government of inaction. There is even a growing murmur that the actions of the government and the Land Commission in recent days have only provoked the Borotbysts into organizing more terrorist attacks. If we want to regain the trust of our people, we must redouble our efforts to show the people that we can protect them!"
ukrsoc.195.t: "Lynching of the [GetRulingParty] Official!"
ukrsoc.195.d: "A terrifying act of terrorism took place today in a regional center that has already been covered by all the local newspapers. Today a rally of disgruntled citizens was taking place in one of the city districts, among them many workers, and of course the rally was not ignored by borotbist provocateurs, who turned it into a mass protest. A local regional deputy from the ruling party arrived at the rally to discuss pressing issues with local residents and find compromises, but the mob, enraged by the Borotbysts provocateurs, attacked the defenseless official and lynched him. About 20 people, some of whom were armed with revolvers, actually took the official hostage, then brutally beat him and handed him over to the vicious mob, which could no longer distinguish between justice and lynching. People's Army units rushed to the scene of the nightmarish incident and forcibly dispersed the protests, however, the situation takes on a distinctly chaotic character and the peaceful citizens demand that the city garrison be reinforced."
ukrsoc.196.t: "Supply Shortfall"
ukrsoc.196.d: "An important food delivery from the agrarian region to Kiev was disrupted today, leaving stores and townspeople without fresh produce. Although the incident went virtually unnoticed by ordinary citizens, who nevertheless received the full price, it came to the attention of the government and the armed forces when it was discovered that the trucks carrying the goods had been seized by Borotbi rebels: the drivers were killed and the food was diverted to the local Red Guards, an illegal terrorist group. The disruption of food supplies has become more frequent recently, following another controversial decision of the Land Commission, which obviously contributes to the strengthening of the Borotbyst opposition."
ukrsoc.190.a: "Something must be done to stop them!"


ukrsoc.200.t: "Shumskyi Calls For All-Ukrainian Strike!"
ukrsoc.200.d: "The leader of the Borotbysts, Oleksander Shumskyi, today in his appeal to the Ukrainian people called for an all-Ukrainian strike - in factories, railroads, etc. The URPSR(b), dissatisfied with the implementation of land reform, has been developing revolutionary sentiments and hatred of the government among our citizens, especially among peasants and workers, for quite some time. They demand an immediate solution to the land question, but have now moved on to more radical measures and are calling for a socialist revolution and what they call "liberation of the working masses from exploitation. This would not be so alarming if it were not for the actual growth of revolutionary sentiment in society. It seems that many will follow this proclamation and paralyze our economy."
ukrsoc.200.a: "Who he is to dictate us?!"

ukrsoc.201.t: "Strikes in Major Cities"
ukrsoc.201.d: "Today major Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Katerynoslav, and Odesa saw major strikes by workers. Demanding fair working conditions as well as a solution to the problems of food and grain in the countryside, workers paralyzed the work of Ukraine's largest factories. Police and army forces are insufficient to contain the protests and it seems that Ukraine is sinking more and more into revolutionary chaos."
ukrsoc.201.a: "Catastrophe!"

ukrsoc.202.t: "Peasants Protest En-Masse!"
ukrsoc.202.d: "Excited by the appeals of the Borotbysts, the peasants began to protest en masse against the bread monopoly and the imperfect land reform. Long in need of an improvement in their situation and a solution to the land question, the peasants grew tired of waiting. It seems that the situation in the village is finally out of the control of the central government. "

ukrsoc.203.d: "The worst situation is in Kharkiv. Revolutionary workers began arming themselves and organizing themselves into militia units. In addition, we received a number of news reports that it was in Kharkiv that the Borotbyst leadership had arrived under cover to lead the revolution. According to the latest reports, the revolutionary masses have seized the telegraph, post office, and administrative buildings, and there are endless masses of workers with red flags in the central squares, demanding justice and equality."

ukrsoc.204.d: "The latest news from Kharkiv is shocking in its cruelty. Local newspapers report that reactionary nationalists and Sich Striltsi arrived in Kharkiv to suppress the protests, resulting in gunshots being heard and a stampede in the central square. People's militia units have engaged in a firefight with the nationalists and so far the UVO is outnumbered and has no tactical or strategic initiative. The outcome of this confrontation is not yet predetermined, but radicalization and violence can only lead to a worsening of the overall situation."

ukrsoc.205.d: "We have almost completely lost control of southeastern Ukraine. The industrially rich regions, as well as the black-earth provinces, for the most part rebelled and recognized the new power of the Borotbysts. Taking advantage of this advantage and legitimacy, today the Central Committee of the UPSR(b) has issued an appeal to all the workers of Ukraine. The revolutionaries announced the establishment of the Ukrainian Socialist Republic, and undertook a march to Kyiv.\n\nFortunately, the revolutionaries' attack was repulsed and they were driven back to the Southeast. However, the loss of the entire southeastern region could not help but worry the government, which announced a general mobilization against the revolutionaries and troublemakers. "

Besides him, Vasyl Ellan-Blakytnyi, a poet and revolutionary, an adherent of the Soviet system, is also a contender for the post. Of the less popular candidates, Panas Liubchenko, one of the youngest candidates, a supporter of anti-etatism and the development of collective farming, is also considered.

In addition, they pointed to the absolute incompetence of the previous government in land reform. In addition to Skrypnyk, Mykola Khvylovyi and Yuri Lapchynskyi, who were considered by the court to be \"Skrypnyk's accomplices\", were also indicted.\n\nAs a result, the Court pronounced the sentence: to sentence Skrypnyk, Khvylovyi, Lapchynskyi, and 12 others to death by shooting as enemies of the Ukrainian people."

First, and most importantly, their divisions and battalions do not conform to the model of the Chervona Armia, to which they should conform.

In reality, however, many of them have their own programs, extending not only to the organization of the rebel divisions under their control, but also to the territory in which they are stationed and operate. This state of affairs cannot continue for long, but the Rada of the Revolutionary Emissaries has no unanimity in dealing with this situation. Some demand immediate subjugation of the Red Otomans, others insist on the advisory nature of the demands, so as not to provoke the already disgruntled generals too much.

The others assume this option to be too radical and just suggest to form coalitions with Poale Zion on the local levels, in local Radas and Trade Unions. The others, who are in minority, believe that we should not cooperate on official level and just ensure Jewish national-cultural autonomy is enough for cooperation between our parties."

ukrsoc.250.d: "It was not only Otoman Petliura who decided to take advantage of the indecision of the Dyrektoria, but also the damned socialists Borotbysts. Publicly opposing the Dyrektoria all these years and months, they decided to stab the Republican government in the back and tried to organize an uprising in the South and Southeast. So far they have managed to contain them, but peasants and workers, drugged by the propaganda of the Borotbyst ideas, are rebelling all over the country.\n\nOtoman and the new government must take all urgent measures to suppress the uprising, or the future of Ukraine will be in jeopardy."
ukrsoc.250.a: "We should crush these traitors!"

ukrsoc.251.t: "Borotbysts Proclaim Socialist Republic!"
ukrsoc.251.d: "We have almost completely lost control of southeastern Ukraine. The industrially rich regions, as well as the black-earth provinces, for the most part rebelled and recognized the new power of the Borotbysts. Taking advantage of this advantage and legitimacy, today the Central Committee of the UPSR(b) has issued an appeal to all the workers of Ukraine. The revolutionaries announced the establishment of the Ukrainian Socialist Republic, and undertook a march to Kyiv.\n\nFortunately, the revolutionaries' attack was repulsed and they were driven back to the Southeast. However, the loss of the entire southeastern region could not help but worry the government, which announced a general mobilization against the revolutionaries and troublemakers. "
ukrsoc.251.a: "Borotbysts should be dealt with now!"

ukrsoc.252.t: "Ukraine In Danger"
ukrsoc.252.d: "After the widespread rebellion of the Borotbysts in the south, Otoman faced several serious questions, one of the key ones being the search for allies. \n\nThe main option was to strike at the opposition from both the left and the right and try to form a new directorate under Otoman's control. A number of politicians from the leading parties: the UPSR, USDRP, PULD(s-f), UPSS and others have already expressed their agreement to form a united anti-Borotbyst front. \n\nAnother option is to propose an alliance to Andriy Melnik, the leader of the Galician Sich Striltsi and an ally of the Dyrektoria. In this way, we would gain the support of Ukrainian nationalists and elite armed forces, which would easily help us in the fight against the Borotbysts.\n\nThe last option is to make concessions to the Borotbysts. An option that seems impossible and would call into question the authority of Petliura. However, this is the only option that will help to solve all the issues peacefully."

A couple of kilometers to the south was already the field headquarters of the Borotbyst Chervona Armia, and in the nearby town itself, Red Flags were flying and looting and rioting were rampant. \n\nBeautiful Poltava region, Otoman's native land! This was the place chosen by the initiators of the meeting of the two commanders-in-chief. A meeting that was to determine the fate of Ukraine. Petliura was the first to appear.

ukrsoc.366.d: "Deepening our connections with the Americans, Khruschev has kept close contact with Iowa-born Progressive Leftist, academic, and corn biologist Henry Wallace, whose own expertise and business connections have led him to create his own corny empire in the American heartlands. Created in 1926 by Wallace, his brother James, and a group of investors from his home state of Iowa, the Hi-Bred Corn Company is aimed at the creation of the perfect corn seed culture, and thus the perfect corn crop. This noble goal is pursued through use of selective breeding, early genetic modification techniques, and the application of genetically modified pollinator species, like certain insects, as well as the creation of special pesticides/herbicides. By working with these American masters of corn, we shall further our own knowledge and deepen our mastery over corn, but that is not all we have gained from this cooperation. \n\nTaking these ideas, Khruschev, Wallace, and their fellow corn-addicts across the globe have begun to work together to create an international regulatory bureau to oversee and manage the hybridization and genetic modification of corn worldwide, ensuring that all tampering with the noble corn plant - the lifeblood of our nation and the wider human species - is done so in a way fitting to our pure standards. However, a debate has arisen internally in this new bureau - nicknamed Pioneer Hi-Bred International by the Wallace brothers - as to the scope of our watchdog and management efforts. Henry Wallace and his company have been known to tamper not only with corn, but with other foodstuffs - particularly chickens - in order to create healthier, larger, and more efficient consumables for the world, and from this variety arises the debate. Many loyal to Khrushev declare that the bureau should only focus on corn so that our attention and expertise are not sullied or divided, and so that we can focus on our true obsession without deviation or increased risk of error, while others believe we should not ‘put all our ears of corn in one basket’, as it were and instead pursue a more varied nutritional foundation. Though we shall continue to work with our partners for the betterment of the hungry masses, we need to decide on a scope for this specific effort; should we only focus on the bioengineering of corn, or should we branch out?."

ukrsoc.374.d: "Seeking to take in the agricultural mastery of the Americans and their neighbors firsthand, Comrade Khruschev has amassed a diplomatic team and has taken flight to the lands of the Combined Syndicates. Planning a tour of their largest corn farms and agriculture facilities or fields, Khruschev wishes to implement many of their successes and new technologies or techniques back at home so that our own corn production can skyrocket like it has here in the New World where this lovely golden starchy vegetable first originated. Touring the States and their farms, Khrushev quickly became giddy and corny as he was filled with joy and delight upon first seeing America’s golden fields o’ plenty waving in the wind, and as such has planned to capstone this enlightening visit with a bang. \n\nAs such, Khruschev’s visit will ultimately culminate in a large diplomatic dinner aimed at uniting the various local facets of the wider global Agrarian Socialist cause. To be held in the Americans’ newly rebuilt capital, Khruschev and his entourage plan for this feast to be cornier and more extravagant than anything the world has seen before, inviting local Agrarian Socialists like Jack Reed, Norman Thomas, Norman Wallace Lermond, William Z.. Foster, Upton Sinclair, Henry Wallace, Earl Browder, and many others, including visiting Socialists of the wider New World dedicated to our agrarian cause like Pancho Villa of Mexico, Jacques Roumain of Haiti, and James Woodsworth of Canada, in order to ensure the dinner is a success, both in taste and in our main goal of fostering of lasting diplomatic ties. \n\nIn order to share the love and bounty of our corn harvests, Khruschev and his corny delegates brought with them wonders of Slavic corn-based cuisine, from corn and crab salad to Eastern European-style corn puffs. Bringing their own dishes as well, our new allies helped us set the table for a truly corny feast, with Pancho Villa and his band of ejidos farmers bringing their delicious corn tortillas and fried or grilled elote, or street corn, while the delegates from Haiti have brought their creamy mais moulin (or mayi moulen) - a local Haitian delicacy of creamed and spiced cornmeal. Not wishing to be ‘out-corned,’ the Canucks have brought their own take on corn pops and corn cakes to try and compete with the Americans and their vast, nearly-unending array of corn-based dishes. From corn fritters, popcorn, and corn chowders to cornbreads, corn chips, and even just plain, buttered corn on the cob, this feast shall hopefully be the first of many as the cornbaskets of the Socialist world band together in order to drive humanity towards proletarian paradise through the widely loved and delicious vehicle that is corn!"
ukrsoc.374.a: "Corn is the future..."

ukrsoc.375.t: "KMS"
ukrsoc.375.d: "Inhabitants of our vast country this morning read in the newspapers about the decision taken at the congress of a certain party \"KMS\". Surprised by the sudden renaming, citizens wondered what was behind the acronym. Among the more creative names were \"Corn Maize Sausage (Kukuruza, Mais, Sosiska)\" and \"Communist Maize Union (Kommunisticheskiy Maisoviy Soyuz)\" After clarification by party representatives, the new name of the party is none other than the initials of our Great Helmsman, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev. \n\nRumor has it that while filling out documents at the recent congress, Khrushchev wrote his initials in the Party column. Despite the obvious typo to many, the secretaries took this at face value. Frightened to point out the Vozhd's mistake, they decided that in this way Nikita Sergeyevich expressed his opinion about renaming the party, and that it was better not to anger him without cause, but simply to officially record that the party now bears the name of its great leader.\n\nThe shuddering situation has already generated a lot of jokes and really made our citizens' day!"

ukrsoc.376.t: "'Arsenal'"
ukrsoc.376.d: "On January 29, 1918, the workers of the factory 'Arsenal' in Kyiv organised an armed pro-Bolshevik mutiny known as a January Rebellion against the Central Rada, the Ukrainian assembly that declared the independence of Ukraine during the Russian Civil War. Since then, the government has failed to interfere with the poor administration of the factory, fearing their actions accidentally sparking a worker’s revolt in Kyiv. After the triumph of Bolshevism in Ukraine however, the government has decided to revive of the factory. 'Arsenal' will mainly produce artillery, anti-tank, and anti-aircraft guns, all of which our nation, surrounded by forces hostile to our revolutionary ideology, desperately need."
ukrsoc.376.a: "God bless Khrushchev!"

ukrsoc.377.t: "'Obolon'"
ukrsoc.377.d: "Nikita Khrushchev knows that the workers and peasants of Ukraine deserve a chance for a happier, better life, which is why he always pays serious attention to the needs of the ordinary people. The Government has proposed an excellent idea that aligns with his thinking. Khrushchev offered to invest in the largest nationalised brewing facility in Europe, allowing us to greatly expand it and lower the price of cheap alcohol. The expansion of the factory, named 'Obolon', will definitely give us increased support among the low and middle classes of the Ukrainian society. After all, who doesn't like alcohol?"
ukrsoc.377.a: "An astute proposal!"

ukrsoc.378.t: "Kulaks Targeted by Land Expropriation"
ukrsoc.378.d: "Nikita Krushchev has been tasked with resolving Ukraine’s economic stagnation, in a speech Khrushchev announced a new economic programme aimed at collectivising the vast lands used by Kulaks for agriculture. According to this proposed programme by integrating privately owned landholdings into state run collectively-controlled farms, a greater crop yield can be achieved. Some within parliament have shown opposition to this programme stating the unwillingness of Kulaks to hand over their land to the state. It is to be seen how successful this programme will be."
ukrsoc.378.a: "A bold strategy from Khrushchev..."

ukrsoc.379.t: "The Red Hetman of Revolutionary Ukraine"
ukrsoc.379.d: "Since the birth of the current Ukrainian state, the Ukranian people have been subjected to ridicule. Mass poverty amongst the working class, ruled by an Austrian puppet king whilst subservient to the German Empire. It appeared to many that the future of this nation was hopeless, that changed with one man. Comrade Khrushchev has taken the mantle of leadership, proving himself to be a modern equivalent to the legendary Hetmans. Khrushchev has firmly booted foreign imperialistic influences whilst pulling the poor out of plight, providing a new hope for all Ukrainians!"
ukrsoc.379.a: "Long live Comrade Khrushchev!"

ukrsoc.384.t: "The New Ukraine"
ukrsoc.384.d: "Once defined by its peasantry dominated agricultural society, Ukraine was always a battle-ground between Russian and European influence and control. Previously lacking a respectable government that put the Ukrainian people first, the tryrannical German bootlicking monarchy is no more. The old backwards Ukraine is no more. Thanks to Comrade Khrushchev the Ukranian state is rapidly industrialising and modernising. Although set back by Kulak resistance and mismanagement of collective farming, the nation has rebounded with a centralised economic plan based upon the ever growing factories that now dominate the farmland. The future of Ukraine is now!"
ukrsoc.384.a: "Without Comrade Khrushchev there would be no new Ukraine!"

### Economy Events ###

ukreco.1.t: "Black Monday Hits Ukraine!"
ukreco.1.d: "Almost two weeks ago the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into the abyss, throwing Germany’s economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now that the crash’s shock waves have reached the Ukraine, German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ukrainian Hrivna is losing value, and resource exports are shrinking exponentially."
ukreco.1.a: "Let us hope that Europe remains open to us."

ukreco.2.t: "Agricultural Crisis!"
ukreco.2.d: "Since the Weltkrieg, Ukraine has traditionally relied upon its valuable grain trade with the German Empire in order to maintain its economic security. Unfortunately the current socio-economic issues afflicting the Reich have meant that it is now far more interested in protecting its own farmers than taking the politically unpopular move of subsidising Ukrainian agriculture. This could be very dangerous for us as without support from the German market, our ruling class of agrarian landowners could find it difficult to maintain their dominance in the countryside."
ukreco.2.a: "We’re still the breadbasket of Europe, right?"

ukreco.3.t: "Germany Averts Agricultural Crisis!"
ukreco.3.d: "Despite the enormous financial difficulties that fell on the shoulders of the Kaiser government, they decided not to raise tariffs on imports, and as a result they were able to avoid an agricultural crisis in our country"
ukreco.3.a: "Seems like Germany is a trustworthy ally."

ukreco.4.t: "Suspension of Dnieper Hydroelectric Station Construction"
ukreco.4.d: "Because of the withdrawal of German investors and the emptying of the treasury, we cannot complete the construction of the Dnieper hydropower plant on time. Workers are on strike and demand timely payment of wages"
ukreco.4.a: "We’ll finish it later."

ukreco.5.t: "The Mitteleuropan Question"
ukreco.5.d: "Our cooperation with Germany has led to the agricultural crisis - the fact, which is undoubtedly accepted by the Hetman and his supporters. He well remembers the previous crisis in 1919, when the Hetmanate was at the great risk of famine because of the Germans. The almost unaffordable demands for grain supplies from Austria and Germany led to the fact that the peasants had practically nothing left, which led to the aggravation of their situation, the strengthening of opposition to the Hetman, the growth of anarchism, banditry and crime. Fortunately, famine was avoided then. If we do not terminate our contracts with Germany now, which actually provide benefits for trade with us to all the countries of Mitteleurope, we may find ourselves in a similar situation again. It is necessary to act immediately, while Germany is weak and cannot fight back against us. We must immediately get out of the economic bloc and raise the prices of our goods, and we don’t care where they get the money for it."
ukreco.5.a: "We should leave the Mitteleuropa."
ukreco.5.b: "This will probably only damage us."

ukreco.6.t: "Ukrainian Government Terminates Brotfrieden!"
ukreco.6.d: "The Ukrainian government has undertaken a new foreign economic doctrine aimed at protecting their sovereignty and interests. As part of this doctrine, practically the first decision of their government was the abolition of the "Bread Peace" which had been in effect since 1918 and which effectively guaranteed the independence of the Ukrainian state from the Central Powers. Thanks to the Bread Peace, tens of thousands of German and Austro-Hungarian soldiers received foodstuffs that were critically lacking. The tariffs had been in effect for nearly 20 years, but now the Breadbasket of Europe had decided to manage its own resources and set prices on the market. Such a drastic change in the volume and quantity of supplies could not but affect the supply of our army and even the civilian population, and we must take decisive measures in response."
ukreco.6.a: "Demand restoration of the treaty!"
ukreco.6.b: "We must seek another source of food."
ukreco.6.c: "Ukraine must be punished! Introduce wide-scale embargo!"

ukreco.7.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Restoration of Brotfrieden!"
ukreco.7.d: "Outraged by our drastic measures, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government demanded the immediate resumption of the status quo and the Bread Peace Treaty, which once again proves [FROM.GetName]'s intention to get everything from Ukraine for next to nothing."
ukreco.7.a: "Funny [FROM.GetAdjective]s! Treaty is Dead!"
ukreco.7.b: "Demand security guarantees and negotiate better terms."

ukreco.8.t: "[FROM.GetName] Embargoes Us!"
ukreco.8.d: "Outraged by our drastic measures, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government imposed an extensive embargo on us. Without [FROM.GetAdjective] goods and armaments, we may have a hard time, but this is the price for freedom and independence."
ukreco.8.a: "We don't need their goods!"

ukreco.9.t: "Brotfrieden Is Declared Dead!"
ukreco.9.d: "Ukraine officially rejected our demands and declared that the Bread Peace was no longer in effect. This impudence of the Ukrainian government has shocked us and now we must respond."
ukreco.9.a: "Enforce the bread and food supplies!"
ukreco.9.b: "Embargo Ukraine!"

ukreco.10.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Security Guarantees!"
ukreco.10.d: "Ukraine has said it is ready to negotiate on food supplies, but in response they demand guarantees of their independence. What should we do?"
ukreco.10.a: "Accept their demands."
ukreco.10.b: "There's no point. Enforce our terms!"
ukreco.10.c: "Refuse the demands and embargo Ukraine!"

ukreco.11.t: "Ukrainian Policies Provoke Food Shortage"
ukreco.11.d: "The new foreign economic doctrine to suspend preferential food supplies has severely hit our allies, including us. Our market was unprepared for the sharp rise in food prices and led to food shortages. Economists predict that the shortage will last at least a year until the market fully recovers and adapts to the new prices."
ukreco.11.a: "Hope we will recover soon."

ukreco.12.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agrees!"
ukreco.12.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government agreed to our terms. This is a great victory for Ukrainian diplomacy, because in addition to the increase in prices for our products, although preserving certain benefits for [FROM.GetName], we were able to get a guarantee of our independence and a non-aggression treaty with them."
ukreco.12.a: "Glory to Ukraine!"

ukreco.13.t: "Mitteleuropa Encounters Bread Crisis!"
ukreco.13.d: "Because of Ukraine's new foreign economic policy, the government took steps to break up the so-called \"Bread Peace\", which largely predetermined the Central Powers' victory in the Weltkrieg by supplying German and Austro-Hungarian soldiers with Ukrainian grain and food at reduced prices.\n\nGermany's colonial policy toward Ukraine has caused a series of political and economic crises, but now the Ukrainian government is finally strong enough to tell its former masters that the \"Breadbasket of Europe\" will now determine to whom and for how much its products are delivered. The countries of Mitteleuropa and the Austrian sphere have already faced the first consequences in the form of food shortages to supply their armies."

ukreco.15.t: "Economic Self-Confidence"
ukreco.15.d: "Since 1918, we have been critically dependent on German consumer goods to fill our markets. Indeed, many in our nationalist government have postulated that this state of affairs is an intentional part of the Reich’s plans to castrate us and turn us into little more than a pathetic puppet, hopelessly reliant on them. On account of our dependency, our farmers aren’t able to develop their own businesses and compete with well-funded German freeholders, many of whom hold key positions in our economy. We have to reconstruct our national agriculture market and end this shameful dependence on the German Empire. This is no time for diplomatic niceties."
ukreco.15.a: "Announce an embargo on German goods!"
ukreco.15.b: "There is no reason to resort to economic warfare."

ukreco.16.t: "Ukrainian Embargo"
ukreco.16.d: "The new Ukrainian government has decided to intentionally reduce our participation in their domestic markets through a series of draconian trade measures, equating in effect to a near-total embargo on our goods. This poses a major problem for our farmers because Ukraine was a big and perspective outlet for their products. Furthermore, we have traditionally been reliant on Ukrainian grain to feed our armed forces. This behaviour by Ukraine is unbelievable considering all we have done for them!"
ukreco.16.a: "Demand a reversal of this outrageous embargo!"
ukreco.16.b: "We can stomach this indignity."

ukreco.17.t: "German Empire Demands an End to the Embargo"
ukreco.17.d: "Our unexpected embargo shocked and angered the German government due to its effects on the Reich’s agricultural sector and their need for our grain to serve their military. The Germans have demanded that we immediately end our protectionist trade measures or else they will begin to strip us of our Reichspakt membership. This embargo has begun to strengthen our economic self-sufficiency and power, but being thrown out of the Reichspakt suddenly may be harmful to us. What should we do?"
ukreco.17.a: "Comply and remove the embargo."
ukreco.17.b: "Maintain the embargo, we must protect our peasants!"

ukreco.18.t: "First Results of the Embargo"
ukreco.18.d: "Our decision to impose an effective embargo on German goods to help our national producers has thankfully led to a stabilisation in our agricultural sector. Perhaps 18% of the state and private farms can now be called self-supporting. As a result we can solve more difficult problems in our economy, since we have support in the villages and farms."
ukreco.18.a: "The bread’s back in the breadbasket of Europe!"

ukreco.25.t: "[ROOT.GetLeader] Announces Completion of Land Reform"
ukreco.25.d: "Today, the government, headed by the Minister of Agriculture, reported on the completion of land reform. The measures taken were aimed at creating a sustainable land policy and satisfying the interests of the peasantry. But the results of this reform may not seem satisfactory to everyone."

ukrmisc.1.t: "Monument to the Zaporizhian Cossacks"
ukrmisc.1.d: "Hetmanate is a period of our history, inextricably linked with the Zaporizhian Cossacks. And although this period was difficult and ambiguous, it is with the Cossacks that we associate the history of the statehood of the Ukrainian state. Today, a monument to the Zaporizhian Cossacks was opened near Cherkassy. The opening was attended by Hetman Skoropadskyi himself, who made a speech and spoke about the importance of historical memory. Among the audience was also the headman of the Kyiv Governorate, Pavlo Adrianov, who also made a speech. \n\nThis is not the first monument to the Hetmanate opened in the last 15 years. Ukrainization is in full swing and we can only hope that soon our people will find their true national consciousness."

ukrmisc.2.d: "Today, Sviato Kupala Day is celebrated in Ukraine. For a long time, the former unofficial national Christian holiday, now July 7 is officially considered a day off.\n\nThe night of Ivan Kupala is filled with rituals related to water, fire and herbs. The main part of Kupala rituals is performed at night. It is considered mandatory for the holiday to swim before sunset. Closer to sunset, bonfires are lit on the hills or by the rivers. On the night of Ivan Kupala, the "betrothed" are chosen and marriage rites are performed: jumping over the fire, holding hands, exchanging wreaths, searching for a fern flower and bathing in the morning dew.\n\nDespite the fact that official events with the participation of high-ranking officials are not held, ordinary Ukrainian people in villages celebrate this ancient holiday with pleasure."
ukrmisc.2.a: "Zelene Kupalo z lita upalo"

ukrmisc.3.t: "'Ivan Ilyich'"
ukrmisc.3.d: "A new play by Mikhail Bulgakov, \"Ivan Ilyich\", appeared today on the posters. The plot is based on castling in time, when due to a malfunction of the machine invented by engineer Tymofeenko, the Kyiv housekeeper Koretskyi, together with the crook Zhorzh Myloslavskyi, move to the XVIII century, and Hetman Ivan Skoropadskyi falls into the XX century. Almost vaudeville confusion leads to the creation of numerous comic situations in which the characters, who find themselves in \"alien\" eras, live according to the laws of their time. \n\nIt turns out that Koretskyi is surprisingly similar to the Hetman, which is noticed by Myloslavskyi, who, posing as Prince Golytsyn, convinces Koretskyi to play the role of Hetman. Koretskyi, being an ardent supporter of modern politics, causes insurmountable horror among the Cossacks by publicly renouncing Peter the Great and his 'Muscovy' and declaring an alliance with the Teutons.\n\nAt the same time in XX Century Kyiv, Hetman Skoropadskyi at first rejoices to learn that his descendant rules the country, but then he is horrified to learn that the Austrian Archduke is sitting at the head of the country as a King, and German garrisons are walking around the city. \n\nThe play ends with everything falling back into place, and Tymofeenko wakes up. However, the ending remains open, giving viewers to wonder if all this really happened."

ukrmisc.4.t: "Dovzhenko’s 'Taras Bulba'"
ukrmisc.4.d: "Ukrainian film director Oleksander Dovzhenko, the founder of Ukrainian cinema, has released his masterpiece - a film based on the famous story of Mykola Hohol about the Zaporizhian Cossacks. Critics have already praised the film, saying that it is the best that the director has shot in his career.\n\nDovzhenko declared himself as an interesting and original master in 1928 with the film \"Zvenyhora\", where episodes of Ukrainian history were intertwined with scenes of the Civil War, where revolutionary epic, satire and lyrics were combined. According to critics, "Zvenyhora" marked the birth of Ukrainian cinema as an art. In 1929, Dovzhenko shot \"Arsenal\", the story of the uprising of the workers of the Kyiv factory in 1918. Then he himself took part in those riots, though on the other side, but in the film he seems to repent that he was blinded by Bolshevik fairy tales. In this film Dovzhenko continued to create his own unique language at the junction of poetic and realistic cinema. In terms of the scope and epicness of the action, Arsenal is not inferior to Zvenyhora - masses of people, many ordinary deaths and one grandiose one in the finale of the film, when the hero takes a blow from the enemy with his bare chest."
ukrmisc.4.a: "Triumph of Ukrainian cinema!"

ukrmisc.5.t: "A Stunning Concert in Berlin"
ukrmisc.5.d: "One of the most famous symphonic ensembles in Eastern Europe, the State Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine, created in 1918 and approved by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, gave a stunning performance in Berlin today. Under the direction of conductor Oleksander Gorilyi, the orchestra played the symphonies of Beethoven, Brahms and Schubert beautifully. Apparently, impressionable German viewers remember last year’s tour of the countries of Mittel Europe and Austria-Hungary, with sold-out tickets and full stalls and amphitheaters. This year the triumph was repeated.\n\nThe National Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine will be a real creative laboratory of Ukrainian composers and conductors. For example, upon returning to Kyiv, the orchestra is preparing to once again play a masterpiece of Ukrainian music - the opera \"Golden Hoop\" by the teacher of the Kyiv Conservatory, Ukrainian composer, Borys Liatoshynskyi."

His books 'On the Banks of the Congo' and 'Safari' previously made him the most popular Ukrainian soldier and writer in the entire country. Chernyakhovskyi has been promoted to the rank of Colonel and will soon become the commander of the 1st Cossack Division ('Serdyutskaya'), which ensures this popular figure will command an elite branch of the Ukrainian army."

The film’s story describes the life of one Russian family in Kyiv just after the German occupation in 1918. The main characters are the Russian officers and Ukrainian citizens that participated in the defence of Kyiv from those disloyal to the new regime of Ukrainian Nationalists and different socialist groups comprised of soldiers in the army of Hetman Skoropadskyi. The film analyses the relations between the Russians and the Ukrainians. Conceived by Bulgakov as a symbol of national reconciliation, 'The White Guard' encourages the unity of the Kingdom and friendship of its people, though some radical groups of the local nationalists consider this film to be Russian propaganda."

Famous in the early 30s as a talented aircraft designer, Koroliv was sent to Germany for an internship, from where he returned in 1932 with plans to build cruise missiles for the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian State. At the initiative of the Germans for the development of the defense capability of Ukraine, a group for the study of missile movement was created, in fact - the state scientific and design laboratory for the development of missile aircraft. To date, projects have already been developed for liquid cruise and long-range ballistic missiles, aircraft missiles for firing at air and ground targets and anti-aircraft solid-fuel missiles.\n\nAccording to the confessions of the youngest aircraft designer, he dreams of a human flight into space and believes that this is possible in the near future.

ukrmisc.11.d: "Mishka Yaponchik is a well-known Odesa criminal who has been terrorizing Odesa residents for many years and escaping from the authorities in an amazing way every time. \nIn 1917, he was released on amnesty, organized a large gang of raiders and became the "thunderstorm of Odesa". Already in the autumn of 1917, the gang of a Yaponchik made a number of daring raids, including robbing a Romanian gambling club during the day. On New Year’s Day in 1918, Goldstein’s store and the sugar factory owner Yu. Gepner were robbed.\n\nAt the same time, Yaponchik organized the so-called Jewish Revolutionary Self-Defense Squad under the pretext of fighting possible pogroms and issued a \"proclamation\" calling for robbing \"only the bourgeoisie and officers.\" In November 1917, one of the robbers was even killed by the Yaponchik himself for robbing a worker.\n\nHe established contacts with the Odesa anarchist movement and in early December 1917, a group of so-called \"anarchist-rippers\" (\"rippers off the bourgeoisie\") appeared in Odesa, who staged a powerful explosion on Deribasovskaya Street in 1917, demanding an end to lynching of captured bandits. Later the bandits seized Eisenberg’s brothel on Dvoryanskaya Street, setting up their headquarters there.\n\nIn January 1918, Yaponchik’s squad, together with the Bolsheviks, anarchists and left SRS, participated in street battles. The bandits took advantage of these events to raid the Registration Bureau of the police, during which a card file for 16 thousand Odesa criminals was burned.\n\nAt the beginning of 1919, he actively collaborated with the Bolshevik underground. During the Civil War, the Yaponchik gang committed many new daring robberies, also engaged in kidnappings and racketeering. A number of entrepreneurs who did not want to pay the bandits were killed. In February 1919, a daring raid was made on a Civil public meeting of Odesa during a gala dinner, the apartment of Duchess Lyubomirskaya and the room of the Spanish consul at the Londonskyi Hotel were also robbed.\n\nYaponchik invested the money earned from crime in real business: he bought the most luxurious restaurant in Odesa. A casino and a brothel functioned under him.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, this open banditry of Yaponchik ended and he lay low, successfully eluding the Derzhavna Varta. However, recently our valiant law enforcement officers managed to raid an underground casino, presumably owned by Yaponchik. Unfortunately, once again, he himself was not there."

In addition to flowers, she also paints landscapes and portraits. Katerina paints with oil paints and makes brushes herself, separate for each paint, independently mastered the technique of priming the canvas.\n\nThe work of Katerina Bilokur is undoubtedly an example of a new Ukrainian painting.

ukrmisc.13.d: "The industrial production of wine in Crimea was started with the assistance of His Serene Highness Prince Vorontsov. He bought the best vines in Greece, Spain, France and Germany and planted them in Masandra and Alupka. By order of His Serene Highness, the first distillery in the Crimea was founded. It was there that some varieties of Crimean port, madeira, and sherry were produced. The high quality of the wine was achieved by blending different grape varieties. In 1837 , the quality of Masandra wines was highly appreciated by the Russian Emperor Nicholas I.\n\nToday Masandra is the oldest wine cellar in the region. The main basement, built in 1897, consists of seven tunnels. The length of each of them is 150 meters and the width is 5 meters. Tunnels fan out from the central gallery. They always maintain a constant air temperature of 10-12 ° C, that is, the best for aging wine.\n\nIn Masandra there are the oldest main wineries for long-term aging and processing of wines, the first wine of its own production was laid in 1898.\n\nAfter several years of relative desolation, the region is now developing again due to state subsidies for wine production and the development of health complexes in the Crimea.

The renaming of the city in honor of another great Ukrainian writer, one of the symbols of our statehood, Taras Shevchenko, is also being considered.

It was the Yuzivka sports society that held the first international match in Donbas - in the autumn of 1924, the workers of the German national team were defeated 5-0. The Hetman government decided to develop sports in Ukraine, and a large amount of funds began to be poured into Yuzivka.\n\nToday, Yuzivka Sports Society is one of the leading football teams in the country. With the money of foreign investors, a stadium was built in Yuzivka, which was officially opened today. \n\nThe sport will continue to develop, despite the fact that Skoropadskyi has repeatedly stated in private correspondence that he considers football \"fun for workers.\""

The film’s story describes the life of one Russian family in Kyiv just after the German occupation in 1918. The main characters are the Russian officers and Ukrainian citizens that participated in the defence of Kyiv from those disloyal to the new regime of Ukrainian Nationalists and different socialist groups comprised of soldiers in the army of Hetman Skoropadskyi. The film analyses the relations between the Russians and the Ukrainians. Conceived by Bulgakov as a symbol of national reconciliation, 'The White Guard' encourages the unity of the Kingdom and friendship of its people, though some radical groups of the local nationalists consider this film to be Russian propaganda."

The film, which was conceived to be an answer to the Bulgakov’s 'White Guard' doesn’t try to point out possible methods of reconciliation, but raises by implication the potential for separatists and spies of foreign powers to still be hiding among the Ukrainian population and both willing and able to try to exploit its weakness."

ukrmisc.24.d: "Before the outbreak of World War I, the Hellenic community of the Azov region lived rather isolated, not particularly interested in political trends. The revolution in the Priazv region came later than in other Ukrainian lands, so it was not very actively supported. This is due to ethnic and social peculiarities of the population of the region, the proximity of the Ukrainian-Russian border and the lack of authoritative representatives of Ukrainian political forces. \nAt the end of October 1917, the Central Rada recognized for the peoples who inhabited the Ukrainian lands \"a national-personal autonomy to ensure their rights and freedom of self-government in matters of their national life\".\nHowever, at the same time, the Central Rada abolished land ownership. Most of the Greek peasants had a lot of land in their estates, so this approach did not satisfy them. This further undermined the already low authority of the Ukrainian local authorities. The leading role in the creation of the Mariupol Union of Hellenes was played by the Greek commercial bourgeoisie, the liberal circles of the Greek intelligentsia, and the well-off Greek peasants. On November 10, 1917 a meeting of representatives of the volost Greek communities was held in Mariupol, which began the establishment of the Mariupol Union of the Hellenes. It was headed by a respected Hellenic leader Illia Pichakhchy. According to its organizers, the association of Mariupol Greeks had to protect the national interests of the Hellenic community in the difficult circumstances. However. the history of the Mariupol Union of Hellenes ended there - soon the congress was dispersed by German troops.\nNow, when words about administrative reform are heard again from the rostrum of the new Rada, Pichakhchy announced the reconstitution of the Mariupol Union of Hellenes and demanded that the government give the Greeks autonomy."

His crops and the crops of his forefathers grew plump and verdant in the fertile soil - soil fertilized by blood and tilled by hardowrking, free, and equal men under the brilliant leadership of Bat’ko Nestor Makhno and his anarchist utopia - but these bright and egalitarian times have long since passed. A new age dawned in these lands following the chaos of the German Intervention, and for years since, these fields have only languished and grown fallow as the new overlords of our once-proud Ukraine - the vile Austrians and Prussians - mishandle the state time and time again. \n\nUkraine weeps, and Mother Anarchy cries for her lost sons as once again the Germanics have proven their inability to run our land and rule our people. With the fallout of Black Monday and the following agricultural crisis caused by Germany’s blind and reckless economic strategies, Ukraine has once again plummeted into chaos. The people have been pushed to the brink, and are once again at each other’s throats as the economy comes crashing down upon our heads, all thanks to Hetman Skoropadskyi kowtowing to the so-called ‘Hegemon’. Even more frustrating, in this time of extreme circumstances, those still loyal to our new overlords have only benefitted while the rest of Ukraine - our Ukraine - has fallen to the dogs. The lowly peasant who tills his mucky soil has only fallen on harder times while his neighbor - an estate farmer down the road loyal to the German-backed Hetmanate - has only prospered, building himself a prosperous and gorgeous farm despite the raging inferno of economic decay that oppresses the true common man of Ukraine. Incidents like these have only caused more resentment to bubble and fester within the working-class masses of our Ukraine, and the hills and swamps of our homeland have once again begun to whisper of better times and more egalitarian, familiar ideas. Though our Bat’ko may be in exile hundreds of miles away to the West, the teachings and ideas of our beloved Father have only begun to grow more popular with each passing day in this ever-worsening maelstrom.

But by the end of the 13th century, as we know, the Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia could not withstand the endless struggle with its much more powerful neighbors. If in the 1260s, King Danylo defeated Mindaugas and annexed the lands up to Novohrudok, by the beginning of the 14th century the Volyn could not oppose the Lithuania any more. That is when the ways of Galicia and Volhynia diverged: the first went to Poland, and the latter to Lithuania.\nWith its incorporation into Muscovy, Volyn, like Podillia, remained an inconspicuous region on the outskirts of the empire, a land of Jewish settlements, Russian garrisons, Polish landlords, and Ukrainian peasants. In addition, the Volyn province included almost all of Polissia, almost the most remote corner of the empire west of Moscow.\nThe development of the region never truly restarted even in the modern times - now it is one of the least industrialized and prosperous of all Ukraine.

Being a core region of the first Hetmanate, it is also known for the Poltava Battle, a decisive and largest battle of the Great Northern War, and a national tragedy for the Ukrainians.\nHowever, the land became the most prosperous of all Ukrainian regions, with a powerful Ukrainian movement, never fully suppressed. There were many noble descendants of Cossack elders in the Poltava region, and local landowners had strong positions due to fertile soils and the growth of trade with the newly colonized southern lands (local fairs were of great importance). Among the local elites, the ideas of Taras Shevchenko and the Cyril and Methodius Society resonated, and until the revolution of 1917, the Poltava region remained one of the main centers of public life of Ukrainians.\nNow, the regions is slowly becoming the industrial center, with Kremenchuk city welcoming more and more labour force from the East, South and West.

The life of the legionnaires here was probably not much different from that of the Soviet and Cossack garrisons in Central Asia and the Far East - a foreign land where only war can save you from deathly ennui. After the Romans, the Ost-Goths, who were brought here by King Philimer, lived here. Through Podolia passed nomads - Huns, Sarmatians, Magyars and others. It was also a frontier of the Kingdom of Rus against the Tatar hordes. But despite the eternal war, Podolia attracted people. Peasants - the undeveloped black earth, merchants - the position at the crossroads of trade roads\nPodillia is a hilly plateau, dissected by deep river valleys, sometimes in the form of real canyons.

He draws attention to Korney's giftedness. At first, Kornei refuses to sell the paintings, but at the entreaties of Rita, who dreams of escaping from the countryside, gives in, and they go to town. The famous critic Mulin, having seen Kornei's paintings, is delighted with his rustic paintings and calls him "the master of primitivism".

Vera comments with patronizingly disparaging sarcasm: the artist who married is dead to art. After such a characterization, Kornei's paintings are not in demand. At this time, the child becomes seriously ill, the money received earlier is spent on expensive treatment. And then the critic Mulin, who has long had his eye on Rita, convinces her to leave the pauper artist for him. Rita, hoping that this will stir up Korney's jealousy and talent, agrees. For some time, Korney remains strangely inactive, but he soon goes headlong into his art, once again achieving recognition. He recaptures Rita... and at the same time is unable to forgive her betrayal.\nThe sudden death of a child brings them together in grief, Rita and Kornei realize that life in the city has not brought them happiness, and decide to return to the village.\nMost of the film met only positive reviews."

ukrmsic.50.d: "Since 1830s the mansion of 3705 sq.m. in the block between Shovkovichna and Sadova streets belonged to Kyiv's administration. In later years the chancellery of Kyiv governor-general, whose residence was located on the opposite side of Institutskaya Street, was placed there. In 1886 the authorities decided to sell the estate, dividing it into three plots. The most part of the estate on the corner of Instytutska and Sadova streets was given to Oleksander Brodskyi, a cousin of Kyiv "sugar kings" Lev and Lazar Brodsky, the founder and director of South-Russian Society of Breweries, the first director of Kyiv Bacteriological Institute. \n\nHowever, after the Dyrektoria came to power, the site was nationalized and Brodskyi's mansion was demolished. The plot in its place was given to Karakis as a new canvas for his work. Knowing very well the architecture of the Kyiv houses, Iosyp Karakis used for the first time in his residential construction an internal staircase with an upper light, traditional for Kyiv in the past. To prove the validity of such a solution, the author decided to measure the lighting of the stairwell in the building. When the architect came in with a cumbersome luxmeter and saw the security guard reading a letter from home at the stairs, he realized that the need for any measurements was gone - there was enough light."
ukrmisc.50.a: "This house with its architecture will be one of the most interesting among the new houses in Kyiv"
#vyshhorodskaya vulytsia
ukrmisc.51.t: "Vyshhorodskaya Vulytsia"
ukrmisc.51.d: "The architect Karakis designed and built a gallery-type dwelling house on Vyshhorodskaya Street. The house was designed for workers of the Kyiv shoe factory. The house had an absolutely atypical for Kyiv gallery system, typical for the southern regions. Staircases were placed on both sides of the building; the entrance to the apartments was through an open gallery. This arrangement saved about 15% of the funds for the construction of the building. The house consists of one- and two-bedroom apartments. The stairwell is located in the center of the building. On the outside of the house the balconies are staggered, which is also atypical for Kyiv."
ukrmisc.51.a: "An interesting experiment."
#development of Rusanovka & Obolon
ukrmisc.52.t: "Development of Rusanivka and Obolon"
ukrmisc.52.d: "The Kyivrada was approached recently with a young architect talent, Iosyp Karakis, who suggested his project of the Rusanivka and Obolon development. With these two districts actively developed by the architects and inviting more and more citizens to live there, Karakis introduced his own vision of communal houses.\n\nIn particular, he presented a plan for the development of Obolon: in order to create a silhouette of the city, he proposed pyramidal with terraced ledges, multi-storey buildings, standing at a certain calculated distance from each other. Despite the fact that his draft caused bewilderment among some of the city employees present at the meeting, the project was received favorably in the press. The city promised to allocate funds for the construction of the Obolon experimental development, and in turn invited Karakis to focus on the typical development of Rusanivka."
ukrmisc.52.a: "Quite a unique design."
#Kyiv univermag
ukrmisc.53.t: "Kyiv Univermag"
ukrmisc.53.d: "Last year the authorities organized a competition to reconstruct the building on the corner of Khreshchatyk and Fundukleiivska Street into a department store for the All-Ukrainian Central Union of Consumer Societies. Of course Karakis could not pass it by and presented his project, which he had coauthored with Kholostenko and Kisilevych, and which called for creating one main facade, which on the first and second floors was divided by pylons topped with allegorical sculptures.\n\nSurprisingly, however, another option was chosen in the competition. Designed in the Art Deco style, the department store had seven floors, high ceilings, marble staircases and an elevator. The new department store in Khreshchatyk became the second big department store in the central street after the Bessarabian covered market. The newly-erected building had a dominant position in the complex of buildings of the pre-war Khreschatyk, taking into consideration its location at the crossing of the two central highways of Kyiv and monumentally designed tower-shaped corner. "
ukrmisc.53.a: "A surprising outcome."
#jewish theater
ukrmisc.54.t: "Jewish Theater"
ukrmisc.54.d: "This year the Jewish Theater was designed and built at Khreshchatyk Street, 17, in Kyiv. It is interesting to note that Jewish Theater project essentially included four different designs for the same theater. Only one of them was realized. The main facade of the realized project was exaggeratedly pompous: a spectacular portico, capitals with Ukrainian symbols, sculptures of a Jew and a Jewish woman in national costumes in the niches, two statues holding a shield with the Ukrainian coat of arms on the crowning tower-belvedere. The walls were enlivened by a high relief composition and a large Yiddish inscription: \"Jewish State Theater\". The capacity of the hall was 1050 seats.\n\nThe Jewish Theater building is a true decoration of Khreshchatyk Street: designed in the solid forms of late constructivism, typical for Karakis's works, this building is representative and monumental, with the spatial scale peculiar to the work of the Master."
ukrmisc.54.a: "Truly a masterpiece!"

ukrmisc.55.t: "Karl Marshalk Dead"
ukrmisc.55.d: "Today in Kyiv, the City's Holovnyi Otoman, or City Head, and part-time head of the Kyiv Derzhavna Varta, Karl Petrovych Marshalk, died at the age of 65.\nBorn into a Baltic German Lutheran family, Karl Marshalk devoted his life to public service; in 1905 he became police chief of the Russian city of Pskov. During his leadership of the city police managed to keep the situation under control, to bring elementary order in the city, to put the city police to the proper level, to strengthen the discipline of personnel.\nLater he became one of the most talented detectives in Russia. Moving to Moscow, he inherited a well-oiled, smoothly operating investigative apparatus (in 1913 the Moscow Investigative Police was recognized as the best in Europe), and worthy successor to his predecessor.\n\nIn 1917, after the revolutionary events in Russia, one of the first steps of the new government was the abolition of the gendarmes and the police, which was replaced by the police. In the criminal investigation was without professionals in their field, so the new government still attracted the old cadres. Karl Marshalk, who was in charge of the search police in Moscow, also remained in service. One can imagine under what conditions he and others had to work, especially after the Kerensky's government announced a complete amnesty for criminals, releasing them from prison and thus bringing to naught all the work of pre-revolutionary detectives.\n\nAfter the beginning of the Red Terror in Russia, fearing for his life, he went to Ukraine and in September 1918 was appointed the city governor of Kyiv, the head of the Kyiv Derzhavna Varta (police) - the Kyiv City Ataman.\n\nThanks to the service of Karl Marshalk, the Kyiv Detective Police was now recognized as the best in Europe, at least in Mitteleuropa, which of course also had an impact on the almost total destruction of the opposition and the Borotbyst terrorists in Kyiv."
ukrmisc.55.a: "Rest in peace!"

ukrmisc.56.t: "Glamorous Kyiv"
ukrmisc.56.d: "From the beginning of the German occupation, Ukraine became the promised land for all those in Russia who did not accept the Soviet regime established in Moscow and Petrograd. For the first time in a long time on the territory of the former Russian Empire, there was a place where the bourgeois average citizen could feel - albeit under the protection of German bayonets, whose presence many \"bourgeois\" were quickly reconciled to - at least in relative safety.\n\nFrom Soviet Russia to Ukraine began the emigration of people from all categories of Russian society. Nobles, landlords, the bourgeoisie, cultural and scientific figures, and intellectuals flocked to Ukraine. Kyiv has never seen such an influx of celebrities. It is enough to name just a few writers, both venerable and young, but already famous: Arkady Averchenko, Vlas Doroshevich, Evgeny Chirikov, Ivan Nazhivin, Don Aminado, Nikolai Agnivtsev, Ilya Ehrenburg, Viktor Shklovsky.\n\nThe famous Khanzhonkov Studio with its team of leading stars of Russian cinema, like Vera Kholodnaya and Ivan Mozzhukhin, settled in Yalta. And by order of Hetman Skoropadskyi, the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences was established, headed by the eminent scientist Vladimir Vernadsky. Kyiv lived a feverish life in the rhythm of Calman's operettas, which were fashionable at that time.\n\n"The Hetman reigned - and fine. Just as long as there was meat and bread in the markets and no shooting in the streets, that, for God's sake, there were no Bolsheviks, and that the common people were not robbed. Well, all this was more or less realized under the Hetman, perhaps even to a great extent. At least, the Muscovites and St. Petersburgers and the majority of the townspeople, though they laughed at the strange Hetman's country, which they, like Captain Talberg, called an operetta, an insubstantial kingdom, praised the hetman heartily... and... "
ukrmisc.56.a: "\"God grant that it may continue forever.\""

ukrmisc.57.t: "Ukrainisches Freikorps"
ukrmisc.57.d: "One of the important steps towards the creation of the second Reichspacht army was the creation of the Ukrainian Freikorps, an armed formation which could be joined by volunteers from among German soldiers who were promised land in Ukraine for their service. Hetman negotiated with Germany to create this formation in early 1919, marking the beginning of the creation of a new social class in Ukraine and, importantly, new German colonies. \n\nNevertheless, Germans had long been living in Ukraine: especially in the South and in Volhynia. In addition, the Germans have long had their own colonial settlements in the Crimea since the early 19th century, such as Neizatz, Friedenthal, Rosenthal in Simferopol district, and Heilbrun, Sudak and Herzenberg in Feodosiya district, and in the late XIX century in the Simferopol City Duma was already about 20% of the Germans, many of whom held high positions. According to the census of 1897 in the Crimea lived nearly 32 thousand Germans - 5.8% of the population of the Crimea.\n\nDespite the fact that Germans have long had their views on the Crimea, and we should obviously keep an eye on our legal peninsula, the German population has grown quite strong in Kherson, Odesa and Volyn. And quite a large number of the increase is due to Freikorps. Although a number of politicians believe that this strengthens our relationship with the Empire, many suggest that it could cause many problems in the future."

ukrfor.252.d: "Ukraine has been turbulent of late. The political crisis that erupted after the September events led to a large-scale outbreak of anti-monarchist forces that succeeded in overthrowing the government and announcing the return of the Ukrainian People's Republic. However, the socialist government was unable to effectively organize the new government, as a result of which Otoman Symon Petliura, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, seized power in the country.\n\nBut this was not the end of the series of misfortunes. The peasants and workers in the South and Southeast, led by radical leftists, revolted against Othoman.

ukrfor.1313.d: "The Panslavic Congress has voted for giving independence to the peoples of Illyria. The Austrians have to respect the right of Croats, Slovenes and Bosnians for independence, national self-determination and recognition. Therefore, the Russian Government demands Austria honour the will of Slavic countries and their own nationals."
ukrfor.1313.a: "Demand Concessions in Austrian Littoral"

ukrfor.1314.t: "Austria Demand Concessions in Austrian Littoral"
ukrfor.1314.d: "The Austrian Government has offered us to leave Austrian Littoral under their control. They have a vital port there, loosing which will lead to Austrian Empire being a landlocked country. What shall we do?"
ukrfor.1314.b: "No. Austrian Littoral is populated by Slovenes and should belong to them."

ukrfor.1318.d.serbia: "While some may say that Vojvodina is a rightful Hungarian territory, in fact, the majority of population are of Slavic nationality.

There is also a province of Bukowina with Romanian population."

ukrfor.1322.t: "Formation of Yugoslavia"
ukrfor.1322.d: "The territory of so-called Illyria is populated by ethnic Slavs - Croats, Slovenes and Bosnians. The idea, proposed at the Panslavic Congress is not the new one. For many years Slavic peoples at the Adriatic Sea struggled for independence from Austrians and Ottomans. They are one people - they speak one language and they live on one territory. Yugoslavia - a nation of South Slavs has always been a dream, but now - it is time to implement dreams in life."

ukrfor.1323.t: "Illyria Rejects Our Demands"
ukrfor.1323.d: "To our great surprise, the Croats do not want to be free - moreover, they want to have their autonomy under the Austrian Boot and continue to oppress Bosnians. They don't want to be free, unite with their Serbian brothers. It is a great disgrace."

ukrfor.100.d: "The last shots of Ukrainian Civil war has just fired and Ukraine is now fully controlled by the Socialist Dyrektoria. As our minister of foreign affairs has said - who controls Ukraine, controls the Eastern Europe.\n\nThe new Ukrainian government has jeopardised the sphere of influence in Eastern Europe that we have spent twenty years carefully constructing. Many hotheads in the Abwehr have suggesed direct military action to punish the new socialist government and deter other potential insurrectionists. Doing so could be extremely unwise however as Ukraine possesses one of the largest armed forces in Europe and they are critical for our long-term plans as a bulwark against a belligerent Russia. However, the some politicians, especially from the SDP have suggested to negotiate concessions with the new government in Kyiv, perhaps we can escape further bloodshed."

Already, officers and advisers that had been stationed on the Ostwall, in Sevastopol and the capital Kyiv, have been surreptitiously evacuated over the course of the day.

The military leadership is of a similar opinion, but it is ready to make concessions and give the Ukrainians only half of their fleet. On the other hand, a number of politicians believe that it is not worth spoiling relations with Europe's new breadbasket and it is necessary to return the entire fleet to the new government to gain its favor, and in return demand only the right to use the docks and naval bases in Odesa, Mykolaiv and Berdiansk."

UKR_Grant_Lypynsky_An_Upper_Hand_desc: "Lypynskyi should become an official advisor and representative of the King. By doing so we will ensure that Skoropadskyi has no other choice but to accept this."
UKR_Relieve_The_Landowners_Tax_Burden: "Relieve the Landowners' Tax Burden"
UKR_Relieve_The_Landowners_Tax_Burden_desc: "The Tax Burden for the landowners became too large in recent times, thanks to the efforts of Skoropadskyi, who decided to focus on peasants more. Smallholders and large landowners both should have benefits, if we want them to be on our side."
UKR_Call_For_Austrian_Intervention: "Call For Austrian Intervention"
UKR_Call_For_Austrian_Intervention_desc: "We cannot risk the conspiracy without Austrian support. The King should visit Vienna and talk to the Emperor about the coup. By ensuring that Austria is on our side, we will have additional backing."

UKR_Prepare_The_Anti_Hetman_Coup: "Prepare For the Anti-Hetman Coup"
UKR_Prepare_The_Anti_Hetman_Coup_desc: "The time has come. The Hetman should be forced to retire if we want to end dualism and save Ukraine from another disaster."

### Hetman Path ###

UKR_Hetman_Path: "The New Hetman’s Government"
UKR_Hetman_Path_desc: "The last government proved to be very bad at fixing the economy. The Hetman needs new people in the government, and especially - loyal people."

UKR_Coalition_Wih_UDP: "Offer Mikhnovskyi a Chair"
UKR_Coalition_Wih_UDP_desc: "Mykola Mikhnovskyi, one of the creators of Ukrainian Conservatism, along with Lypynskyi and Skoropadskyi, now is leading a national-democratic UDKhP party, or 'Democrats-Khliborobs'. In fact, he is not an actual leader. Instead, he was exiled by Hetman a few years ago to Kuban, where he teaches in university, away from political life of Ukraine. Nevertheless, now without any more possible allies, perhaps it is high time for Hetman to turn to Mikhnovskyi and offer him a seat in the government."
UKR_Concessions_To_The_National_Democrats: "Concessions to the National Democrats"
UKR_Concessions_To_The_National_Democrats_desc: "Despite we cannot fully trust Mikhnovskyi, we can ask for his support without ensuring that his party has strong foundation. We should give some of the UDKhP politicians official seats in our system, perhaps, as local Starostas of the governorates."
UKR_Ease_The_Pressure_On_Peasants: "Ease the Pressure on Peasantry"
UKR_Ease_The_Pressure_On_Peasants_desc: "The pressure on peasantry is as large as ever. We should not risk the majority of population to starve or live in poverty. Some tax benefits should take place soon as part of the recovery programme of the SHD."
UKR_Discredit_Moderate_Monarchists: "Discredit the Moderate Monarchists"
UKR_Discredit_Moderate_Monarchists_desc: "The USKhD has proved to be the supporters of 'false King', an impostor, placed in Ukraine by Austrian Imperialists. We should not trust those who do not want Ukraine to be led by a true Ukrainian man, like Skoropadskyi. Hopefully, the population will understand this."

UKR_Dissolve_Sejm: "Dissolve the Soim"
UKR_Dissolve_Sejm_desc: "Our Soim (Parliament) has always an imposed institute and never really supported Skoropadskyi’s policies as Hetman. As intended, Skoropadskyi will dissolve the Soim, due to the state of emergency and finally shake out the government out of its legislative stupor. Now stacked primarily with regime puppets and useful officials from different Ukrainian regions, the Council of Ministers will restore order."
UKR_Extend_State_Powers: "Extend The Executive Powers"
UKR_Extend_State_Powers_desc: "The executive powers have always been a bit too weak and this allowed the left-leaning Rada to dominate state affairs. But with the new government in place it is time to extend them so as to create a greater and stronger Ukrainian state."
UKR_Disarm_The_Sich_Streltsy: "Disarm the Sich Striltsi"
UKR_Disarm_The_Sich_Streltsy_desc: "The Sich Striltsi are becoming dangerous and Hetman clearly understands this. Moreover, they can be on the King’s side, which is bad for our regime. Hetman once disbanded their corps in 1918 and it seems that now it is time to do it again."
UKR_Empower_Derzhavna_Varta: "Empower the Derzhavna Varta"
UKR_Empower_Derzhavna_Varta_desc: "Thanks to the Derzhavna Varta, our internal affairs are in good condition. The less people are destabilizing our country - the better. However, as Hetman believes, Derzhavna Varta should be given even more legal power to act."

UKR_Hetmanate_Is_Not_Yet_Lost: "The Hetmanate Is Not Yet Lost"
UKR_Hetmanate_Is_Not_Yet_Lost_desc: "Our power is strong, and we are ready for the coup if it is planned. The Hetmanate is not yet lost as is Ukraine!"

### Point of Divergence ### 

### King is dead - Hetman is in power ###
UKR_Explosion_Dnieper: "Explosion on the Dnieper"
UKR_Explosion_Dnieper_desc: "The death of the King has come as a shock to us all, and now one question remains - in what direction will our nation travel in the aftermath?"

UKR_Outlaw_Radicalism: "Start the Kyiv Trials"
UKR_Outlaw_Radicalism_desc: "With the explosion on the Dnieper, a wave of political repression begins in the kingdom. From Skoropadskyi’s point of view - a fair trial for all those involved. Of course, their guilt will be established by the court, but who says that the evidence will not be enough?"
UKR_Settle_the_Austrian_Issues: "Settle the Austrian Diplomatic Crisis"
UKR_Settle_the_Austrian_Issues_desc: "After the explosion on the Dnieper, relations with the Austrian Empire were strained, as Vienna believed that our state had failed to cope with the terrorist threat. We need to restore diplomacy, at least conditionally."
UKR_Skoropadsky_Policy: "Ukrainian Unity"
UKR_Skoropadsky_Policy_desc: "The relations between the Russians and the Ukrainians in Ukraine are good enough, but various powers try to depict them as an eternal struggle between the West and the East. We must stop this chauvinistic propaganda, but our aim is also to show that despite the common past and good relations with Russia, we are independent now and will always be."
UKR_Look_Out_To_Russia: "Look Out to Russia"
UKR_Look_Out_To_Russia_desc: "With the collapse of the German economy, perhaps we should look eastward to Russia, which is rising from the ashes. The Russophile wing of the SHD particularly insists on this"
UKR_Threaten_Germany: "Rethinking Mitteleuropan Cooperation"
UKR_Threaten_Germany_desc: "Enough to be satisfied with the German hosts. We are an independent country and we will dictate terms to Germany ourselves, if they want to receive stable grain from us."
UKR_Prohibit_Syndicalism: "Prohibit Syndicalism"
UKR_Prohibit_Syndicalism_desc: "We have reached an understanding with the pro-Russian circles, pacified the various Ukrainian movements and helped make the peasantry loyal to us. Now we have to deal with the Socialists. Our mass media will start a massive propaganda campaign, showing the Syndies as a malignant tumour on Slavdom. Our efforts will eventually enable us to ban many notorious left parties."
UKR_Federalisation: "Decentralization Under Supervision"
UKR_Federalisation_desc: "The Socialists, Nationalists and the Russophiles have all tried to impose their ideas on the whole country. This has demonstrated the flaws of the centralised approach of the Hetmanate. If we give our regions more autonomy and weaken the Supreme Rada, we will be able to stop regional debates becoming flashpoints on the national stage to ensure political chaos remains a thing of the past."
UKR_Peasant_State: "The Peasant State"
UKR_Peasant_State_desc: "Our peasants have always played a significant role in the country and its economy. With extra money available from our reduced military spending, we can reduce taxes for the poor until our agriculture recovers from Black Monday and we will become the breadbasket of Europe once again."
UKR_Army_Reforms: "Draft an Army Reform"
UKR_Army_Reforms_desc: "It is obvious that the Ukrainian army is incomparable to the Russian and German behemoths, and yet it is still stronger than any neighbouring army. That’s why Skoropadskyi has proposed re-orientating our army towards a smaller professional force. It will help us maintain our security, and will allow us to reduce our costly defence spending."
UKR_End_The_Martial_Law: "End the Martial Law"
UKR_End_The_Martial_Law_desc: "The state of emergency imposed by Hetman is coming to an end. For now, this does not mean the return of the Sejm, nor does it affect the state of affairs in the country, except for a sense of some calm and stability"
UKR_Restore_Vilne_Kozatstvo: "Restore the Vilne Kozatstvo"
UKR_Restore_Vilne_Kozatstvo_desc: "The Vilne Kozatstvo or the Free Cossacks emerged as civil defense detachments and territorial paramilitary formations defending the independence of Ukraine. In accordance with the demand of the German occupation command, in April 1918, the Hetman had to disarm the Free Cossacks. However, now that our country has become stronger and more independent, it is time to revive this movement, for it is the essence of our power!"
UKR_Revive_Ukrainisation: "Revive Ukrainisation"
UKR_Revive_Ukrainisation_desc: "In recent years the pace of Ukrainianization has slowed down a bit, but our state needs the growth of national consciousness, the development of Ukrainian culture and science. It is necessary to take measures to actualize the Ukrainian national movement."
UKR_Regency_Council: "Convene the Regency Council"
UKR_Regency_Council_desc: "The first reforms are over, and the time has come to convene a Council of Regents to determine the future heir of the deceased King Vasyl"
UKR_Hetman_Of_All_Ukraine: "Hetman of All Ukraine"
UKR_Hetman_Of_All_Ukraine_desc: "The Regency Council made a decision and Hetman Skoropadskyi himself was declared the new [GetUKRTitle] of Ukraine!"
UKR_Legacy_Of_Imperial_Russia: "Legacy of Imperial Russia"
UKR_Legacy_Of_Imperial_Russia_desc: "The order of pre-revolutionary Russia remained fairly common in Russia, but with the advent of the Austrian king, an increasingly pro-Western way of life and lifestyle was adopted. Skoropadskyi believes that the tsarist regime brought many good things and that the old orders should be restored"
UKR_Finish_The_Banditry: "Blow to the Organized Crime"
UKR_Finish_The_Banditry_desc: "Rampant crime, especially in Odesa, was still a serious problem. However, since we have strengthened Derzhavna Varta, we will have no difficulty in destroying crime in Ukraine!"
UKR_Reform_Derzhavna_Varta: "Reform the Derzhavna Varta"
UKR_Reform_Derzhavna_Varta_desc: "Derzhavna Varta, Ukraine’s police and security service, needs reform. Our custodians of law and order must be well equipped and trained to face any threats to our stability"
UKR_Restructure_The_Bureaucracy: "Bureaucratic Overhaul"
UKR_Restructure_The_Bureaucracy_desc: "The bureaucratic apparatus, thanks to the efforts of Soim and Korol, became essentially their main stronghold in the regions. They still remain in place, hindering Skoropadskyi’s effective policies. It is necessary to replace them with loyal subalterns and to establish contact between the regions and the central government"
UKR_Support_The_Protofis: "Support the Protofis"
UKR_Support_The_Protofis_desc: "The Protofis, or organization of large industrialists, needed the support of the Hetman to counterbalance the large German capital that dominated Ukraine"
UKR_Invest_In_Industry: "Invest in Industry"
UKR_Invest_In_Industry_desc: "The industrial development of Ukraine is a matter of existential importance. Without industrialization we will not be able to withstand any army."
UKR_New_German_Contracts: "New German Contracts"
UKR_New_German_Contracts_desc: "Without German support, we are powerless. It is necessary to conclude new contracts with large German companies and make them invest in Ukraine"
UKR_The_New_Ukrainian_Aristocracy: "The New Ukrainian Aristocracy"
UKR_The_New_Ukrainian_Aristocracy_desc: "Similarly to Tsarist Russia, a new aristocracy was forming in our country - from among the large landowners and industrialists. They are one of the pillars of our regime and it is necessary to ascertain their loyalty to Skoropadskyi."
UKR_Ukrainian_Agrarism_Skoropadsky: "Ukrainian Agrarianism"
UKR_Ukrainian_Agrarism_Skoropadsky_desc: "Despite the support of large landowners, Skoropadskyi understands how important it is not to forget the peasants and farmers. By supporting private small farmers, we will ensure the popular support of Skoropadskyi and the development of our economy."
UKR_Ukrainian_Church_Significant: "Magnify the Ukrainian Church Significance"
UKR_Ukrainian_Church_Significant_desc: "The independent Ukrainian Church is one of the major achievements of Skoropadskyi’s rule. The church plays an important role in the national self-determination of Ukrainians and should be supported."
UKR_Science_Development_Grants: "Science Development Grants"
UKR_Science_Development_Grants_desc: "Ukrainian Science should become one of the most successful in the new Europe. Thanks to its development with the help of grants, we will ensure a name for ourselves in the world of science."

### Economy Focuses ###
UKR_Agricultural_Crisis: "Agricultural Crisis Reaction"
UKR_Agricultural_Crisis_desc: "The agricultural crisis has almost shattered the Ukrainian economy and stability in the country. The King barely controls the country, those loyal to the Hetman peasants want land reforms, pro-Russian forces and Nationalists demand radical measures and the Socialists mobilise their supporters all over the country...""
UKR_Stabilize_Hryvnia: "Stabilize the Hryvnia"
UKR_Stabilize_Hryvnia_desc: "For the first time, hryvnia was released into circulation on October 17, 1918. Initially, the hryvnia was supposed to play the role of domestic loan bonds. However, the shortage of banknotes in circulation led to the fact that both bonds and individual coupons began to be used as money at the beginning of 1919. During this time, the economy has stabilized and many of the efforts of former Finance Minister Anton Rzhepetskyi to stabilize the national Ukrainian currency have been justified. However, due to Black Monday, the situation has worsened. Urgent measures must be taken to stabilize the Hryvnia!"
UKR_deposit_protection_law: "Empower Derzhavnyi Bank"
UKR_deposit_protection_law_desc: "By 1936, a wide network of credit and banking institutions with a multi-level structure was created in the country, which covered all branches of the agrarian-industrial economy of the region. It ensured the normal movement of goods, money and credit resources, although its power was significantly inferior to similar systems of industrial and industrial-agrarian countries of Western Europe. However, now our system needs additional support from the state. By giving extra powers to the Derzhavnyi (State) Bank, we can make sure it can bail out failing commercial banks."
UKR_State_Sponsored_Construction_Works: "State-Sponsored Construction Works"
UKR_State_Sponsored_Construction_Works_desc: "To industrialize the country and do so fast, the state needs to direct money and resources towards construction projects which are critical to the economy of the state and so need to be finished quickly. Let us create a system of these works and help the Ukrainian economy grow."
UKR_Rural_Credit_Banks: "Rural Credit Banks"
UKR_Rural_Credit_Banks_desc: "With the agricultural crisis raging, credit is not a popular thing in the rural areas. The State Land Bank refused to give credits directly to the farms, being on the edge of default. We should establish rural banking systems, created to give poor peasants access to much-needed financial support and credit."
UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery: "Begin Ukrainian Recovery"
UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery_desc: "Social problems always provoke political instability. Lots of peasants join Socialist, nationalist or Russian separatist movements because of awful living conditions. If we want to save Ukraine from collapse, we should start a recovery programme and help the poorest grain-growers in Central Ukraine, providing our population with the cheap electricity they require. For this, we need cash."

UKR_Prospecting_In_Donbas: "Donbas Mining-Industrial Complex"
UKR_Prospecting_In_Donbas_desc: "The Donbas region in Ukraine is rich in coal and is one of the most developed industrial centers even now. But as our government foresees, it can be expanded even further."
UKR_First_Loan: "German Loan For Electrification"
UKR_First_Loan_desc: "We should ask Germany for a loan, which we will be able to use for the electrification of the the poorest grain-growers. By doing so we will improve their living conditions and help modernise their production methods. They must understand that the situation in Ukraine is unstable and it is important to help us, since we secure German interests in the East."
UKR_First_TaxHike: "Taxes For The Electrification"
UKR_First_TaxHike_desc: "We must use our own resources and raise taxes, since there is no other way to get investment for the programme of the electrification of the villages in the Central Ukraine. We hope that our peasants will understand us."
UKR_Electrification: "New Resources"
UKR_Electrification_desc: "Our government has finally been able to electrify all the villages in Central Ukraine. As a result our peasants will be able to produce more agricultural goods and supplies. Now we also need more resources, to fuel our nation’s recovery and create the tools to do it."
UKR_Second_Loan: "German Loan For Industrialisation"
UKR_Second_Loan_desc: "We have improved the situation in Central Ukraine - it’s time to do something in the Eastern part of the country. All the factories built by the Tsarist government should be modernised as fast as possible. But we need investment and technological support from our ally in Berlin!"
UKR_Second_TaxHike: "Taxes For The Industrialisation"
UKR_Second_TaxHike_desc: "Electricity is available all over the Central Ukraine - now it’s time to rebuild industry in the Eastern part of the country. All the factories built by the Tsarist government should be modernised as fast as possible. And that’s why we have to raise taxes. Again."
UKR_Kharkov_Industry: "Kharkiv Industrial Zone"
UKR_Kharkov_Industry_desc: "Kharkiv has always been one of the most populated cities in Ukraine, but we have never used this advantage in our economy. Now is a perfect time to launch the formation of a new industrial region in the Kharkiv region and finally make our industry strong!"
UKR_Yekaterinoslav_Industry: "Invest in Katerinoslav"
UKR_Yekaterinoslav_Industry_desc: "Despite Kharkiv is a nice place to develop our industy, its closeness to the Russian borders can become truly a disadvantage. Instead, we shall relocate our efforts to the Katerinoslav region, in the central part of our country."
UKR_Stab_econ: "Invest in the Western Regions"
UKR_Stab_econ_desc: "Thanks to our elaborate measures, we revived our economy and mitigated the consequences of the Black Monday for Ukraine. We can hope that our economy will soon prove itself to be competitive throughout Europe."


### Focuses ###


UKR_Invite_Khrushchev: "Invite Khrushchev Into Government"
UKR_Invite_Khrushchev_desc: "Nikita Khrushchev, a well-known but controversial Ukrainian social-democrat, proposes the populist idea, very popular among the peasants, of the reorganisation of our agriculture. We have to admit, that that this proposition seems like it can help Ukraine in her time of crisis. Maybe we should invite him into government to implement these reforms?"
UKR_Popular_Front: "Popular Front"
UKR_Popular_Front_desc: "Though we have given Khrushchev free reign to reorganise the economy, many of our legislators in the Rada have prevented any attempt by Khrushchev to reduce the power of the Kulak landlords. That’s why Khrushchev has announced a creation of the 'Popular Front', which will unite left members of the Supreme Rada and give him enough authority to change the laws."
UKR_Language_Issue: "Solve The Language Issue"
UKR_Language_Issue_desc: "The Russian language is widespread in Ukraine and the native tongue of many of our citizens, but it has never been an official state language. If we grant Russian a formal role in the Ukrainian state, it will allow us to gain popularity among pro-Russian citizens and solve one of the divisive issues our nation faces."
UKR_Exp_Kulaks: "Expropriate Kulak Holdings"
UKR_Exp_Kulaks_desc: "'Kulaks' or 'Kurkuls' is a category of relatively affluent farmers who are able to hire a lot of the poorest peasants and thus earn an enormous amount of money. Since they are hated by the majority of the peasants, we can easily expropriate they lands and divide them between the poorest peasants in the country."
UKR_Tax_Kulaks: "Increase Kulak Taxation"
UKR_Tax_Kulaks_desc: "'Kulaks' or 'Kurkuls' is a category of relatively affluent farmers who are able to hire a lot of the poorest peasants and thus earn an enormous amount of money. Since they are the only group of the farmers that are still able to fulfil our consumer needs, it would be wise to let them have their lands, but to impose an additional tax on them."
UKR_Coll_Prog: "Collectivisation"
UKR_Coll_Prog_desc: "After the latest agricultural crisis among the 'Kulaks', we have many new poor peasants all over Ukraine. Khrushchev proposes that they can work on new collective farms and produce goods for the state, which will provide them with farming tools and pay them a reasonable salary. This should hopefully, through pooling of resources, boost our total output."
UKR_Fate_Monarchy: "Fate of the Monarchy"
UKR_Fate_Monarchy_desc: "King Vasily has become somewhat of a laughing stock to the Ukrainian people. By handing major powers to Krushchev and seeing more issues solved in months than the King himself had resolved in years he has only highlighted his own irrelevance. A former Austrian puppet king with no Austrian backing, his position is being openly debated by Popular Front members."
UKR_Syn_Rev: "A Red Hetman"
UKR_Syn_Rev_desc: "As the great Hetman Bogdan Khmelnitskyi, who once liberated people on both banks of the Dnieper from the Polish yoke, once did; Nikita Khrushchev and the Popular Front deposed the King, the Hetman, and purged the Rada of all elements not willing to embrace the new reality. Finally the people of Ukraine are ready to build new society, one both proud and free!"
UKR_Friendship_Nations: "Unite the People"
UKR_Friendship_Nations_desc: "The capitalists did their best to divide the people of Ukraine, imposing chauvinism and intolerance on the national minorities of our country. But new leadership with Khrushchev is ready to fight this deception and will encourage a policy of unity amongst all citizens of this great nation!"
UKR_Remove_Khrushchev: "Purge Khrushchev"
UKR_Remove_Khrushchev_desc: "The recent denigration of the royal position has demonstrated that Krushchev and his Popular Front partners are an unacceptable threat to King and Country. We will remove them from all of their offices in a major purge with the Hetman’s backing. Once done, we will have to abolish their most radical laws and start to re-calibrate our economy."

UKR_comrade_devotion: "Comrade Devotion"
UKR_comrade_devotion_desc: "Ukraine is whole once more, the nation united in support of Khrushchev’s policies, this nation-wide strive for excellence has created an atmosphere of hard work. Across Ukraine in factories, farms, mines, ports, stores there are dedicated workers forging a new Ukraine!"
UKR_wealth_distribute: "Distribute Our New Wealth"
UKR_wealth_distribute_desc: "Profits gained from the new Kulak taxes will be distributed amongst the poorer labourers in order to decrease economic division. Providing workers with a higher income will boost popularity for Khrushchev and raise the living standards for many. Greed has polluted the nation, it is time for equality for all!"
UKR_new_society: "New Ukrainian Society"
UKR_new_society_desc: "A nation of true freedom, happiness and equality! A united proletariat represented both in the fields labouring and in the government dictating. Now we can declare the foundation of a new nation, one that is directed by socialism!"
UKR_peasant_army: "Revolutionary Peasants' Army"
UKR_peasant_army_desc: "The military of the Ukranian state was mostly composed of reactionary and nationalist commanders, when comrade Khrushchev seized power many of these generals refused to serve under a socialist republican. Therefore Khrushchev has restructured the military into a mass fighting force of proletariat, they may lack in experience whoever they are loyal comrades!"


UKR_Broad_Coalition: "Coalition With The Nationalists"
UKR_Broad_Coalition_desc: "Realising the scale of the Socialist threat, Hetman Skoropadskyi decided to strike a bargain with the pro-Russian 'ViN' and nationalist 'SUN'. Both parties will get freedom of action in regions where they are especially popular, but in return they will support Skoropadskyi’s regime and the King in the Rada through a 'confidence and supply' agreement."
UKR_Rightist_Government: "Initial Administrative Reforms"
UKR_Rightist_Government_desc: "Members of 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian Nationalists' have begun to replace Hetman-period officials in the regions en-masse, somewhat upsetting the balance of the Rada. Surprisingly, this has had a positive effect on our economy because eager new local governments are keen to solve the problems afflicting their own towns. The first steps of reform are underway."
UKR_ViN_Russophiles: "Church and Nation"
UKR_ViN_Russophiles_desc: "It seems that Mikhail Bulgakov, with the help of 'ViN', has finally found a method by which the land question can be resolved amicably. The Ukrainian Church, which is a part of the Russian Orthodox Church, will sell vast swathes of mostly unoccupied lands to the peasants at a discount, but Orthodoxy will be recognised as the formal state religion in Ukraine."
UKR_Abolish_Law: "Recognise Russian"
UKR_Abolish_Law_desc: "One of the biggest problems which exists in Ukraine is the language question. De-facto, the Russian language is used by a majority of the population, but its usage is prohibited by the state institutions. 'ViN' has always opposed this prohibition and thus it is with great pleasure that Mikhail Bulgakov is now able to abolish this language law."
UKR_Free_Trade: "Eastern Free Trade Area"
UKR_Free_Trade_desc: "The free trade area with Ukraine has shown its benefits. The borderlands which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg are full of collieries and ironworks now. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest level since 1918. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
UKR_Crisis_Coalition: "Crisis in the Coalition"
UKR_Crisis_Coalition_desc: "Though the Socialist threat has mostly melted away due to government reforms, 'ViN' and 'SUN' have gained too much popularity among the citizens of Ukraine and their followers are inadvertently violently splitting our country apart with their nationalistic fervour. This situation cannot continue as the situation in Europe is quickly deteriorating."

UKR_Dissolve_Rada: "Dissolve the Rada"
UKR_Dissolve_Rada_desc: "Our Supreme Rada (Parliament) has always been too left and never really supported Skoropadskyi’s policies as Hetman. The King has been shaken out of his legislative stupor to grant Skoropadskyi the authority to dissolve the Rada and form instead a loyal State Senate, stacked primarily with regime puppets and useful officials from different Ukrainian regions."

UKR_Snap_Elections: "Call Snap Elections"
UKR_Snap_Elections_desc: "The leader of the Rada, failing to achieve a majority government, has invoked a vote of no confidence in the current Ukrainian government. Falling to public pressure, he has decided to call for the first free and fair elections in nearly 20 years to try and boost legitimacy."
UKR_Popular_Kingdom: "A Popular Hetmanate"
UKR_Popular_Kingdom_desc: "The elections were a rousing success, and one of the popular, pro-Ukrainian parties has taken an absolute majority in the Rada. Despite this, many corrupt elements still exist in the government, and it is our responsibility to ensure those responsible are ousted from power."
UKR_Agrarian_Reform: "Agrarian Reform"
UKR_Agrarian_Reform_desc: "Now that we have a mandate from the people, it is time to take back control of our farms from the German oligarchs. The government has devised a program which provides an incentive system for existing landowners to sell their farmland to the government at above the market rate, from which smaller parcels will then be provided to Ukrainian citizens. Furthermore, we have received permission from the German government to sell our grain outside of the Mitteleuropan sphere, provided these other nations are not considered a direct threat to the Reichspakt and exports to the German sphere take priority."
UKR_Defenders_of_Democracy: "Defenders of Democracy"
UKR_Defenders_of_Democracy_desc: "The Ukrainian armed forces have always been a point of weakness in our young nation. With us sharing much of our border with the unpredictable Russian bear as well as the rising red tide across Europe, it is time to upgrade our armed forces with help from our allies in order to best defend a free Ukraine from threats abroad."
UKR_Ukrainian_Identity: "A Ukrainian Identity"
UKR_Ukrainian_Identity_desc: "While Ukraine as a state has not existed for very long, our nation has existed for hundreds of years. We must invest in education, the arts, and the Ukrainian language so that the people within our borders know what it truly means to be Ukrainian."
UKR_Enshrine_Freedoms: "Enshrine Basic Freedoms"
UKR_Enshrine_Freedoms_desc: "The Rada has passed an amendment to the Ukrainian Constitution, enshrining basic freedoms such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, and perhaps most significantly, freedom to organize into a trade union. The protections of unionization and a free press may not go over well with the Germans, but King Vasyl has publicly announced that such freedoms are necessary to prevent a Socialist uprising."

UKR_Pereyaslav_treaty: "Treaty of Pereyaslav"
UKR_Pereyaslav_treaty_desc: "With Russian nationalists in charge of the Ukrainian government, the option is now available for us to petition the Russian government for reintegration back into Mother Russia. There is no guarantee that they would risk incurring Germany’s wrath by accepting us however."
UKR_OUN_Embargo: "Embargo Germany"
UKR_OUN_Embargo_desc: "With Ukrainian nationalists dominating the government, the time has come to put the Ukrainian people first - by taking a serious gamble. For too long our nation’s economy and agricultural sector has been geared towards serving the Germany people at our own expense. This will end. Protectionism is the only way we can assert ourselves."
UKR_Grand_Coronation: "A Grand Coronation"
UKR_Grand_Coronation_desc: "With the Kingdom finally becoming stable once more it has been proposed that a second and grand coronation inside Saint Sophia’s Cathedral be prepared. Unfortunately due to the political turmoil following Vasyl’s death, [ROOT.GetSuccessorName] was unable to receive a proper coronation. This will be rectified at once."
UKR_Ban_ViN: "Ban ViN"
UKR_Ban_ViN_desc: "The so-called 'Faith and Nation' organisation is little more than a front for russophilic traitors and if they were in power they would see us annexed into the old Empire. With Dontsov assuming the mantle of government it is time to permanently rid ourselves of these treacherous scum."
UKR_Ban_OUN: "Ban The SUN"
UKR_Ban_OUN_desc: "The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists, often referred to as the SUN, has become something of a problem in recent years. With its fervent anti-German rhetoric, they could become a dangerous enemy and the most simplest way to deal with them is ban them and crack down on their operations."
UKR_New_Scientists: "New Scientists"
UKR_New_Scientists_desc: "The main aim of our government has always been stability. With a new atmosphere of relative calm descending on the nation our young people are moving into the sciences and many companies are investing into research. We can only support this process."
UKR_Discredit_Democrats: "Discredit Moderate Republicanism"
UKR_Discredit_Democrats_desc: "For many years the moderate republicans of Ukraine have attacked and criticised our rule for various reasons and harken back to the short-lived people’s republic. Their influence must be curbed and the legacy of the UNR slandered in the minds of all Ukrainians."
UKR_State_Companies: "State Backed Companies"
UKR_State_Companies_desc: "As the economy begins to grow again we can begin investing in state-backed companies to further our already healthy industrial output and sheild the economy from any further downward trends."
UKR_Secret_Police: "The Bureau Of Special Investigations"
UKR_Secret_Police_desc: "With the last few years being tumultous at best it has been decided that a new kind of police force must be established. One that will strike from the shadows and monitor those extremists in the syndicalists who would see our state crumble."
UKR_Ban_Extremist_Parties: "Fate of Extremist Parties"
UKR_Ban_Extremist_Parties_desc: "After the shocking death of the king, it is time to lay down our differences, come together, and make sure extremism never once again plagues our land."
UKR_Espouse_Democrats: "Espouse Democratic Values"
UKR_Espouse_Democrats_desc: "For many years the moderate republicans of Ukraine had attacked and criticised this country’s rule for various reasons and harkened back to the short-lived people’s republic. It is because of them that our transition to a full-fledged constitutional monarchy has been so successful. Their influence must be recognized and the legacy of the UNR praised in the minds of all Ukrainians."
UKR_Curb_Executive: "Limit The Executive Powers"
UKR_Curb_Executive_desc: "The executive powers have always been a bit too strong and this allowed extreme reactionaries to dominate state affairs. But with the new government in place it is time to limit executive powers and grant more to the democratically-elected Rada so as to create a greater and more united Ukrainian state."
UKR_Slava_Ukraini: "Glory to Ukraine!"
UKR_Slava_Ukraini_desc: "'Slava Ukraini!'- Glory to Ukraine - is the national salute of Ukraine. First heard in the brief revolution of 1917, it has since been repurposed by right and left alike as a symbol of Ukrainian unity. It is now being heard along the streets of Kyiv, oftentimes accompanied with praises to the Hetman, and the threat of Syndicalism has been more or less expunged."

UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery: "Begin Ukrainian Recovery"
UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery_desc: "Social problems always provoke political instability. Lots of peasants join Socialist, nationalist or Russian separatist movements because of awful living conditions. If we want to save Ukraine from collapse, we should start a recovery programme and help the poorest grain-growers in Central Ukraine, providing our population with the cheap electricity they require. For this, we need cash."

UKR_Revive_Agriculture_desc: "Our main aim was to turn Ukraine into the breadbasket of Europe and an indispensable partner to Germany and the Reichspakt.

Now we must reconstruct our national agriculture market, using our industry and new agricultural tools, to end this sorry state of affairs."
UKR_Donbass_Industry: "Rejuvenate Donbas Factories"
UKR_Donbass_Industry_desc: "After a long period of political turbulence, the situation in Ukraine is more or less stable, and we have a good chance to continue reforms.

 UKR_change_the_command: "Dismiss Senior Russophile Command"
 UKR_change_the_command_desc: "The Senior General Staff consists, notoriously, of ex-Imperial Russophile officers, that joined Skoropadskyi as far as in 1918.

 UKR_focus_on_manpower: "Increase Mobilisation Efforts"

 UKR_focus_on_quality: "Professional Striltsi-Based Host"
 UKR_focus_on_quality_desc: "We should not rely on common soldiers. Instead, we should build a professional army based on Sichovi Striltsi, our elite infantry division, consisting of true patriots."

 UKR_Democratization_Of_Army: "Democratization of Army Structure"
 UKR_Democratization_Of_Army_desc: "The Army structure is too centralised around the main High Command in Kyiv. Instead, there is a proposal to divide our territory into several military districts, similar to our administrative-territorial divisions. Moreover, we should give our officers more initiative and rely on them instead of the General Staff, which is far from battle."
 UKR_Professional_Priority: "Landeswehr Inspiration"
 UKR_Professional_Priority_desc: "The Baltic Landeswehr always was a source of inspiration for the Hetman.

 UKR_army_research_bureau: "Establish the Army Research Bureau"
 UKR_army_research_bureau_desc: "As we march into the future, it becomes plainly obvious that new wars will rather be won using superior technology than any long-form trench warfare or “flood-wave” tactics.

 UKR_reverse_engineer_artillery: "Reverse Engineer Foreign Artillery"
 UKR_reverse_engineer_artillery_desc: "Artillery has become more and more useful in warfare, so much so that many frontline battalions nowadays are exclusively based on punishing artillery fire.

 UKR_Revive_Chernova_Kavaleria_desc: "Despite the dwindling use of cavalry in modern warfare, in a country such as Ukraine, horse cavalry still has use as support and mobile troops because of our terrain and lacklustre infrastructure, and historical traditions.

ukraine.1.d: "The Kingdom of Ukraine proclaimed its independence with German support on 25th January 1918, a state of affairs that was quickly ratified by the Peace of Nations agreement at Brest-Litovsk. An initial experiment with socialism in the form of a People’s Republic was swiftly expunged by a German-backed coup. This operation, led by the strongman and former general in the Russian army Pavlo Skoropadskyi, set the tone for Ukraine’s future. It was to be a breadbasket used by a military-aristocrat elite from across Eastern Europe as a source of food, a convenient market for goods and a military bulwark against the weakened Russian Republic. For a time the dispute between Germany and its Austro-Hungarian ally over Ukrainian rumbled on after the Weltkrieg, eventually settling on a compromise whereby King Vasily, an Austrian archduke born Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, would rule with the support of Skoropadskyi, who as the German-allied 'Hetman', holds incredible powers of both civil and military affairs. By 1927, German involvement in the Austrian Ausgleich negotiations meant that Ukraine fell de-facto into the hands of the Hetman, with King Vasily becoming an increasingly marginalised figure. Ukraine under the Hetmanate has become the breadbasket of the Reichspakt, and made its wealthy landowners exorbinantly wealthy, but at the expense of the Ukrainian peasantry. Now, almost twenty years after the Weltkrieg the national situation is unstable. The Reich forces us to sell our goods almost exclusively to nations within its sphere of influence while Socialists gain popularity amongst the downtrodden rural poor and city workers with each passing day. Both ethnic Russians and the pro-Russian population dream of unification with our former master to the East while Ukrainian nationalists proclaim that our Kingdom is no more than a German puppet. This is a immutable truth. Despite these many issues afflicting us, our land is prosperous and fertile, our people industrious and our potential boundless."
ukraine.1.a: "Shche Ne Vmerla Ukraina!"
ukraine.2.t: "The Ukrainian Government"
ukraine.2.d: "It is fair to say that our government is divided. While Pavlo Skoropadskyi does his best to solve the antagonism between the army, consisting of former officers of the Russian Imperial Army, and the civil administration, most of which actively supports our current position in the Reichspakt, many of Ukraine’s problems can only be solved when the majority of our population - the kulaks and peasants - have an opportunity to sell their substantial agricultural produce in Europe beyond the narrow confines of the Reichspakt."
ukraine.2.a: "We shouldn't provoke the peasants!"
ukraine.3.t: "Black Monday Hits Ukraine!"
ukraine.3.d: "Almost two weeks ago the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into the abyss, throwing Germany’s economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now that the crash’s shock waves have reached the Ukraine, German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ukrainian Hrivna is losing value, and resource exports are shrinking exponentially."
ukraine.3.a: "Let us hope that Europe remains open to us."
ukraine.4.t: "Agricultural Crisis!"
ukraine.4.d: "Since the Weltkrieg, Ukraine has traditionally relied upon its valuable grain trade with the German Empire in order to maintain its economic security. Unfortunately the current socio-economic issues afflicting the Reich have meant that it is now far more interested in protecting its own farmers than taking the politically unpopular move of subsidising Ukrainian agriculture. This could be very dangerous for us as without support from the German market, our ruling class of agrarian landowners could find it difficult to maintain their dominance in the countryside."
ukraine.4.a: "We're still the breadbasket of Europe, right?"
ukraine.5.t: "Faith and Nation"
ukraine.5.d: "Before the agricultural crisis pro-Russian movements were rather weak and disunited, ensuring they didn't pose much of a threat to our government. This crisis has led to a shocking rise in popular support for these organisations and an increase in their willingness to cooperate. Yesterday a famous Russian writer from Kyiv, Mikhail Bulgakov, proclaimed the unification of the three largest movements into a singular organisation known as 'Faith and Nation' ('Vera i Narod') or just 'ViN'. Supported by the Ukrainian Church, itself heavily influenced by the Moscow Patriarchate, the population of Southern and Eastern Ukraine and many high-ranking officers, this movement could provoke serious instability in some parts of our country."
ukraine.5.a: "We really must protest!"

ukraine.7.t: "Dmitri Dontsov Deported From Galicia-Lodomeria"
ukraine.7.d: "Dmitri Dontsov, an renowned ideologue of Ukrainian nationalism, has been deported from Galicia, where he had urged the local Ukrainian minority to resist the Austro-Hungarian administration. He now claims that our silence on the crisis has exposed the weakness of our government, and that’s why Ukraine should be ruled by 'real Ukrainian patriots'. His slogan 'Ukraine for the Ukrainians' is attractive to many citizens, especially in Western Ukraine, and graffiti has been spotted in a number of towns. This could be dangerous for the cabinet, since we've already lost considerable support in the East."
ukraine.7.a: "Welcome home I suppose..."
ukraine.8.t: "Khrushchev criticises the Ukrainian government."
ukraine.8.d: "Nikita Khrushchev, a prominent Ukrainian social democrat, has opened the 3rd Congress of the Ukrainian Syndicalist Party. He demands that the government takes extreme measures to defend the workers and peasants from poverty brought on by the global crash. To further this agenda he has proposed a new programme of major social and economic reforms aimed at helping Ukraine overcome the crisis. The controversial figure is going to present his plan in the Rada soon."
ukraine.8.a: "Extreme measures? This stinks of Bolshevikism!"
ukraine.9.t: "Our Future"
ukraine.9.d: "The agricultural crisis has almost shattered the Ukrainian economy and the stability of many of the nation’s most important institutions. The King’s grip on the country is weakening by the hour, peasants loyal to the Hetman want major land reform, pro-Russian malcontents and Ukrainian nationalists demand radical measures and the Socialists are mobilising workers all over the country. Various political movements struggle for power in our teetering nation, and soon we have to choose who will lead Ukraine into the future."
ukraine.9.a: "Ukraine will stagger on as it always has!"
ukraine.10.t: "Khrushchev’s Speech"
ukraine.10.d: "As one of the few social democrats in the Rada, Nikita Khrushchev wields an mesmerising degree of influence over the Ukrainian peasantry and urban rabble. He has taken advantage of our troubles in a recent speech, where he has openly called for sweeping land reforms, an extension of the electoral franchise and an end to landlord dominance in the countryside. These demands are extremely popular among the lower classes, and are giving them ideas dangerous to national stability. Despite this, perhaps we could make use of Khrushchev’s popularity and allow him to become the face of economic reforms unpopular amongst the rural landlords that we would otherwise take a political hit over anyway."
ukraine.10.a: "Dismiss Skoropadskyi and invite Khrushchev to head a popular government."
ukraine.11.t: "The Language Issue"
ukraine.11.d: "Nikita Khrushchev has joined the government as leader during one of the darkest periods in our nation’s history since 1918. However, before solving the economic problems it is imperative that Khrushchev respond to the burgeoning pro-Russian movement, which has had a malign impact on our electorate in industrial Ukraine. One method that could help neutralise their popularity is by addressing the language question, a domestic dilemma that has been lingering for years. The Russian language is used de-facto by a substantial percentage of the population, however its usage is expressly prohibited in state institutions. This has given rise to accusations that Russians are treated as second-class citizens."
ukraine.11.a: "Make Russian the second official state language."
ukraine.11.b: "Arrest important pro-Russian leaders."
ukraine.12.t: "National-Socialists Protest!"
ukraine.12.d: "Notable Ukrainian National-Syndicalists Vlas Chubar and Alexander Shumskyi oppose Khrushchev’s decision to allow the usage of the Russian language in administrative institutions. They claim that this measure won't help to unify our country and that unopposed usage of the Russian language will lead to the growth of the separatist organisations in Southern and Eastern Ukrainian."
ukraine.12.a: "Millions of our workers don't think so."
ukraine.12.b: "All right, all right. Restore the status quo."
ukraine.13.t: "Pro-Russian Leaders Stir Up Trouble"
ukraine.13.d: "Leaders of the different pro-Russian movements have unfortunately managed to escape Ukrainian soil before they could be arrested. Many have sought temporary exile in Romania and Russia, with both nations somewhat hostile to our pro-German regime and aware of the Kaiser’s gaze turning west. Mikhail Bulgakov has announced publicly that the nationalist umbrella organisation 'Faith and Nation' is ready to fight for the rights of Russians in Ukraine. Maybe we have made a big mistake."
ukraine.13.a: "Another problem!"

ukraine.16.t: "The Fate of the Ukrainian Monarchy"
ukraine.16.d: "His Majesty King Vasily I Vyshyvanyi gave Nikita Khrushchev extensive powers in a bid to control the revolutionary trends sweeping the country in the aftermath of the crisis. Now that Khrushchev’s initial programme has been implemented successfully, many interest groups within Ukraine have begun debating the continued prominence of the monarchy considering its relative powerlessness in the face of recent crises."
ukraine.16.a: "The bourgeoisie like liberty, but would prefer a less radical government."
ukraine.16.b: "The poor love Khrushchev, but hate the King! Long live the Republic!"
ukraine.16.c: "The King shall invite Volodymyr Chekhivskyi to save the people and the kingdom."
ukraine.17.t: "A New Minister of Security?"
ukraine.17.d: "Igor Kistyakovskyi has been our minister of Security since 1918 but recently had to retire from his post because of his poor health. 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian Nationalists' have immediately started fighting for this position because each party hopes to increase their influence over Ukrainian internal policy. We have to give 'ViN' or 'SUN' this post, according to the power-sharing agreement concluded before the elections."
ukraine.17.a: "Volodymyr Khitrovo from 'ViN'"
ukraine.17.b: "Volodymyr Chekhovskyi from 'SUN'"
ukraine.17.c: "Danylo Skoropadskyi, son of our Hetman."
ukraine.18.t: "Free Trade Area With the Ukraine"
ukraine.18.d: "The new Ukrainian government has sought to reconstruct the economy by establishing a free trade area between the Ukraine and the Russian market. This virtual erasure of eye-watering tarrifs and customs duties at the border would be a substantial boon for our own merchants and industrialists. Furthermore, opening up the largely agrarian Ukrainian market to Russian importers desperate to feed the austerity-hit masses in Russia’s major cities would massively boost our economy..."
ukraine.18.a: "Launch this project!"
ukraine.19.t: "Free Trade Area Results in Profits"
ukraine.19.d: "The free trade area with Ukraine has shown its benefits. The borderlands, which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg, are now home to a number of new collieries and ironworks and our urban poor now have access to cheap Ukrainian grain to supplement their diet. The unemployment rate has been reduced substantially in certain key sectors. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
ukraine.19.a: "Great."
ukraine.20.t: "Free Trade Area Results in Profits"
ukraine.20.d: "The free trade area with Russia has shown its benefits. The borderlands, which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg, are now home to a number of new collieries and ironworks and our grain, previously rotting in the fields, now has access to a massive market in the form of the Russian urban poor. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest level since 1918. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
ukraine.20.a: "Great."
ukraine.21.t: "Prosvita is Effective!"
ukraine.21.d: "The activities of the Prosvita Movement have had a demonstrably positive influence on our youth, with membership numbers soaring into the hundreds of thousands at least. A number of young people are ready to defend their country, culture and traditions. They will be perfect recruits for our armed forces."
ukraine.21.a: "That’s right young men, enrol in the army!"
ukraine.22.t: "Regional Languages"
ukraine.22.d: "Though Skoropadskyi refused to recognise the Russian language as a second state language, he allowed the Ukrainian regions to choose which languages could be officially recognised. Now that the majority of our regions have recognised the Russian language, Skoropadskyi has finally conceded to give it the same position in a national scale."
ukraine.22.a: "'Yazyk' and 'Mova' should have a common future in Ukraine!"
ukraine.23.t: "Ukraine Request Recovery Aid"
ukraine.23.d: "The Ukrainian government has asked us for a relatively substantial loan, which they wish to use for the electrification of the poorest grain-growers. One of our major Reichspakt allies and the bastion of our Ostwall against a Russian resurgence, Ukraine’s situation is already incredibly unstable, in part due to our protectionist measures during Black Week that proved detrimental to Ukrainian agriculture."
ukraine.23.a: "Very well. Grant them the money."
ukraine.23.b: "Who cares about Ukraine?"
ukraine.24.t: "Germany Grants Us a Loan!"
ukraine.24.d: "The German Empire has accepted our request! Now we can invest this money into the electrification of the villages in Central Ukraine, which promises to increase our support amongst the peasantry, boost our agricultural productivity and improve our rural economy. Germany’s decision is perhaps not surprising. Ukraine is, after all, a much better place to invest in than Poland!"
ukraine.24.a: "Germany is truly our friend and protector!"
ukraine.25.t: "The Electrification is Complete!"
ukraine.25.d: "With the aid of loans from the German government, our government has finally been able to electrify virtually all of the villages in Central Ukraine, greatly improving the agricultural yields of our peasant farms. As a result of this and our previous measures Ukraine has finally begun to recover from the crushing effects of Black Monday."
ukraine.25.a: "Great!"
ukraine.26.t: "Germany Has Declined to Grant Us a Loan!"
ukraine.26.d: "The German Empire is not going to help us with investment. We must either increase our taxes or abandon this plan."
ukraine.26.a: "We can use our own resources. Time to raise the taxes."
ukraine.26.b: "These reforms weren't necessary anyway..."
ukraine.27.t: "The Electrification is Complete!"
ukraine.27.d: "Even though Germany refused to grant us loans, our government has finally been able to electrify virtually all of the villages in Central Ukraine through increased taxation, greatly improving the agricultural yields of our peasant farms. As a result of this and our previous measures Ukraine has finally begun to recover from the crushing effects of Black Monday."
ukraine.27.a: "It was worth it."
ukraine.28.t: "Another Ukrainian Loan"
ukraine.28.d: "The Ukrainian government asked us for a loan again, which they want to use for the industrialisation of the Eastern part of the Ukraine to quell Socialist power there. However, the size of this loan is much bigger than the one before. Many senior personnel in our administration believe that the rise of Syndicalism in Ukraine is a direct threat to Reichspakt solidarity."
ukraine.28.a: "Very well, give them the money."
ukraine.28.b: "There is a crisis in Germany, you know."
ukraine.29.t: "Germany Granted Us Another Loan"
ukraine.29.d: "The German Empire has accepted our request for further capital! Now we can invest this money into the industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine. It should help us to defeat the burgeoning Socialist movement there."
ukraine.29.a: "Very well."
ukraine.30.t: "Industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine"
ukraine.30.d: "Many workers in Eastern Ukraine have gotten new jobs in emerging industries due to our investment there, funded by the loan from Germany. As a result our loyalty amongst the urban poor has grown immensely, greatly neutering the power of the Socialist movement there. We have recovered from Black Monday, while also crippling the power base of the trade unions!"
ukraine.30.a: "Two birds with one stone. Fantastic!"
ukraine.31.t: "Germany Refused A Second Loan!"
ukraine.31.d: "The Germany Empire is not going to help us with investment in our industrial East, shortsightedly forgetting that the more power Syndicalism gains in Eastern Europe, the greater the threat to their interests. We must choose whether to increase our taxes or abandon this plan entirely."
ukraine.31.a: "Time to raise taxes."
ukraine.31.b: "It’s too damn expensive!"
ukraine.32.t: "The Industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine"
ukraine.32.d: "Many workers in Eastern Ukraine have gotten new jobs in emerging industries due to our investment there, funded by extra taxes levied on the population. As a result our loyalty amongst the urban poor has grown immensely, greatly neutering the power of the Socialist movement there. We have recovered from Black Monday, while also crippling the power base of the trade unions!"
ukraine.32.a: "Two birds with one stone. Fantastic!"
ukraine.33.t: "Ukraine asks for help!"
ukraine.33.d: "Ukraine, a new Syndicalist nation in Eastern Europe led by Nikita Khrushchev, has requested our support. They cannot start the reform of their industry alone and they have turned to friendly nations overseas for help. There are some plans that have been proposed by our economy minister - the question is which one should we choose?"
ukraine.33.a: "Time to help their military industry!"
ukraine.33.b: "Let’s build a brewing facility in Kyiv!"
ukraine.33.c: "They can do everything without us."
ukraine.34.t: "Syndicalist Ukraine Leaves the Reichspakt"
ukraine.34.d: "The treacherous Ukrainians have deserted the Reichspakt, jeopardising the sphere of influence in Eastern European that we have spent twenty years carefully constructing. Many hotheads in the general staff have suggesed direct military action to punish the new Syndicalist government and deter other potential insurrectionists. Doing so could be extremely unwise however as Ukraine possesses one of the largest armed forces in Europe and they are critical for our long-term plans as a bulwark against a belligerent Russia. Members of the Abwehr have instead suggested that we ought to use our ties with many senior Ukrainian army officials to instigate a reactionary coup d'etat in Kyiv. The choice now is how we should react to this clear betrayal."
ukraine.34.a: "We do not have the resources to respond."
ukraine.34.b: "Covert operations should be resolve this."
ukraine.34.c: "Crush the Syndicalist traitors!"
ukraine.35.t: "German Military Mission Leaves the Ukraine"
ukraine.35.d: "Following our decision to leave the hated the Reichspakt bloc, the German military mission present in our country since 1918 has finally left! Already, officers and advisers that had been stationed on the Ostwall, in Sevastopol and the capital Kyiv, have been surreptitiously evacuated over the course of the day. This is truly a testament to an independent Ukraine."
ukraine.35.a: "The chains are broken, for now at least."

ukraine.37.t: "Ukraine Requests To Join The Internationale"
ukraine.37.d: "The government of the Ukraine have recently announced their intention of joining the Syndicalist bloc in the face of German reactionism in Eastern Europe. Unlike the vast majority of Internationale members Ukraine’s Syndicalist government stems not from revolutionary activity, but working with monarchists and German stooges in government - making them most unorthodox. Still, Ukrainian peasants would be useful in the crusade against the bloodthirsty Germans and Canadian pigs."
ukraine.37.a: "Together we shall envelop the hated Bosche!"
ukraine.37.b: "Their chain-breaking credentials are... unworthy."
ukraine.38.t: "We Join the International"
ukraine.38.d: "The International is happy to see us joining the common cause, namely, destroying the evil imperialists. Now we are in the Syndicalist bloc we are part of a united struggle that stretches from Luhanks to London. Only together can we survive in the face of reactionary terror."
ukraine.38.a: "We will defend our liberty and independence!"
ukraine.39.t: "Attempt at a Military Coup"
ukraine.39.d: "German agitators, with the help of reactionary officers and a part of our armed forces, have launched a coup against our government and are trying to restore the pro-German regime in Ukraine. Elements of the Military Mission that had previously been deployed in key garrisons on the Ostwall, in Sevastopol port and in the capital joined forces with pro-German troops and have started running street battles near the ministry buildings. The country is in absolute chaos and liable to deteriorate further, with the survival of Syndicalism in Ukraine on a knife-edge. How will the situation develop?"
ukraine.39.a: "The reactionary putschists secure Kyiv!"
ukraine.39.b: "The Red militias successfully defend Kyiv!"
ukraine.40.t: "Reactionary Coup in the Ukraine Succeeds"
ukraine.40.d: "Members of the German Military Mission together, with reactionary members of the Ukrainian armed forces, have successfully seized control of Kyiv, overthrowing the Syndicalist government and replacing it with one again loyal to the German Empire. After a number of street battles and open warfare raging in government buildings, the putschists began purging Reds wherever they could find them. A nervous King Vasily was given sweeping powers by a pliant Rada and again signed Ukraine up as a formal member of the Reichspakt. We have successfully prevented the poison of Syndicalism from spreading any further in Eastern Europe, and for this the Abwehr should be commended."
ukraine.40.a: "Excellent!"
ukraine.41.t: "Military Coup in the Ukraine Failed"
ukraine.41.d: "Our attempt to replace the government in Ukraine with one loyal to our state has failed miserably. Though our Military Mission staff and a number of anti-Syndicalist elements of the Ukrainian army managed to launch a coup d'etat in Kyiv and seize a number of government buildings, they were swiftly overwhelmed by Red militias and executed en-masse. What should we do now? Already widows of the fallen are baying for blood."
ukraine.41.a: "There is nothing we can do..."
ukraine.41.b: "War will solve this!"

ukraine.43.t: "No support from France!"
ukraine.43.d: "Though the Commune of France knows about our internal problems, it seems that they are not going to help us... at least for the moment. This is perhaps not too surprising given the situation that they find themselves in. Despite the setback, we have to be persistent and hope that we will improve our relations with the strongest Syndicalist nation in the world in future."
ukraine.43.a: "Let’s hope they won't forget us completely."
ukraine.44.t: "Ukrainian Claim On Bessarabia"
ukraine.44.d: "Bessarabia was occupied by Romanian Forces on the 27th of March, 1918. Back then, we couldn't do a thing, but now we might just have a chance to set this injustice right. Since the current international situation is favourable for us, we should renew our claims on Bessarabia and retake it from Romania."
ukraine.44.a: "The Iron Guard must accept our demands."
ukraine.44.b: "The King must give us back our land!"
ukraine.45.t: "Ukrainian Demands"
ukraine.45.d: "Yesterday, the Ukrainian government demanded the return of the Bessarabia region that we seized back in 1918. If we fold to the Ukrainian claims, we will lose a substantial portion of our territory and the name of the Iron Legion will live on infamy, but if we refuse, we could very well face an immediate invasion by our powerful neighbour. How should we react to these dreadful demands from our northern rival?"
ukraine.45.a: "Accept their demands."
ukraine.45.b: "Never! Bessarabia is Romanian!"
ukraine.46.t: "Iron Guard Romania Refuses!"
ukraine.46.d: "The Iron Guard leadership in Romania have published a note, which insists that Bessarabia is rightful Romanian territory, and that no Ukrainian soldier will set foot on its sovereign territory. The treatise is filled with xenophobic remarks and references to history which have caused outrage and dismay in government circles, and upon it being leaked to the press, the wider public. The Romanian Legionaries have given us great offence."
ukraine.46.a: "Then it is war!"
ukraine.46.b: "Return Bessarabia."
ukraine.47.t: "Ukrainian Demands"
ukraine.47.d: "Yesterday, the Ukrainian government demanded the return of the Bessarabia region that we seized back in 1918. If we fold to the Ukrainian claims, we will lose a substantial portion of our territory and besmirch the dignity of our Crown, but if we refuse, we could very well face an immediate invasion by our powerful neighbour. How should we react to these dreadful demands from our northern rival?"
ukraine.47.a: "Accept their terms."
ukraine.47.b: "Never!"
ukraine.48.t: "Romania refuses!"
ukraine.48.d: "The Romanian King has published a note, where he insists that Bessarabia is rightful Romanian territory, and that no Ukrainian soldier will set foot on his sovereign territory. The only solution to this problem is the war with the Romanians."
ukraine.48.a: "Then it is war."
ukraine.48.b: "Return Bessarabia."
ukraine.52.t: "An Heir to King Vasily?"
ukraine.52.d: "Unfortunately, our King has no children and as such theoretically has the right to choose his successor. In practice however, this decision is up to the Ukrainian government itself and only two candidates are even being considered by senior ministers. The nephew of Vasily, Leo Stefan Habsburg and Danylo Skoropadskyi, son of our Hetman, are both contenders for the throne. 'ViN' and 'SUN' support Danylo as they believe he will weaken Ukrainian dependence on the Reichspakt by virtue of his lack of royal ties with the European dynasties. Leo, despite his dynastic ties, only has support from Skoropadskyi’s opponents and employers, many of whom have serious connections with Germany and Austria. The question now is which is preferable. Some also propose to abolish the German monarchy which was imposed on us at the death of the King."
ukraine.52.a: "Leo Stefan Habsburg!"
ukraine.52.b: "Danylo Skoropadskyi!"

ukraine.61.d: "Since the dismemberment of the Russian Empire after the Weltkrieg, both Russia and the Ukraine have been independent countries with their own destinies. At the same time, both states have proven to be weaker apart than united. Now, with each state having reached some level of domestic stability, more and more citizens in both nations are calling for reunification particularly due to the rule of the Russophile Vera i Narod party in Ukraine. Although it could lead to a split with the Reichspakt this might be the one great chance for Great and Little Rus to reunite into a resurgent Greater Russia - a state that can confidently oppose Germanic hegemony in Eastern Europe."

ukraine.71.d: "Ukraine has come to us offering a military alliance, promising us access to their vast agricultural system, Black Sea ports and the undermining of Germany’s the Reichspakt bloc. While it'd certainly be good to stand with our Slavic brothers, the reaction from Germany would be unfavourable to say the least. What should we do?"
ukraine.71.a: "Accept the offer!"
ukraine.71.b: "We do not need this."
ukraine.72.t: "Russia Accepted The Proposal!"
ukraine.72.d: "Russia agreed that we should be in the same alliance, which will secure Eastern Europe both from the German imperialists and Syndicalist threat. the Reichspakt couldn't make us hate our brothers from Great Russia, which is why we decided to form this alliance - and we believe it will also be profitable for us."
ukraine.72.a: "That’s what Khmelnitskyi wanted 300 years ago!"
ukraine.73.t: "Ukraine Abandons the Reichspakt For Russia"
ukraine.73.d: "An absolutely disgraceful situation has emerged on our eastern flank. Ukraine, supposedly our loyal ally and the linchpin of our Ostwall defences, has left the Reichspakt and entered an alliance with the Russians, asserting their independence from German control. Diplomatic heads have been rolling in Berlin all day. We can't risk a war with the Russians over Ukraine regardless of what some officials are calling for, surely?"
ukraine.73.a: "They aren't worth it!"
ukraine.73.b: "We shall destroy them both!"
ukraine.73.c: "We can't fight on yet another front!"
ukraine.73.e: "A two front war is undesirable, but necessary!"
ukraine.74.t: "Ukraine Abandons the Reichspakt"
ukraine.74.d: "An absolutely disgraceful situation has emerged on our eastern flank. Ukraine, supposedly our loyal ally and the linchpin of our Ostwall defences, has left the Reichspakt and decided to assert their independence from German control. Diplomatic heads have been rolling in Berlin all day. We can't risk a war with Ukraine now, surely?"
ukraine.74.a: "Curse them!"

ukraine.74.c: "We can't fight on yet another front!"
ukraine.74.e: "A two front war is undesirable, but necessary!"
ukraine.75.t: "Austria Accepted The Proposal!"
ukraine.75.d: "Austria agreed that we should be in the same alliance, which will help bolster the might of the Hapsburg lands from the Vengful syndicalists and Russians alike. though the Reichspakt was mighty, we will be better off here."
ukraine.75.a: "True brotherhood with another Kaiser"
ukraine.81.t: "A place in the world for Ukraine"
ukraine.81.d: "For the longest time, the Ukrainian nation has been split, conquered, ruled over, been subordinate. For the first time in many centuries however we are finally free from the German, Russian and more alike, sovereign is our people and now they look toward the bright future. However it seems as however bright that future is, one thing cannot be clearly seen through the radiant sun rays is exactly what kind of Sovereignity the Ukrainian nation should exercize, many of our people wish only to enjoy their new found freedom in peace while others wish for us to look outward as a actor of the world stage rather than inward."
ukraine.81.a: "Ukraine will only have part in Ukrainian affairs"
ukraine.81.b: "This alliance suits us still"
ukraine.81.c: "Ukraine is a true power, we will act like it!"
ukraine.82.t: "Military Command Seized by Khrushchev!"
ukraine.82.d: "The Ukrainian Armed Forces have been infested by reactionary nationalists since its formation, these politically connected generals serve to promote ideas that conflict with Comrade Khrushchev’s  grand revolutionary plans. Therefore it is unacceptable to maintain the current military command structure, these reactionaries will be demoted and replaced will those loyal to our great Comrade, for the sake of stability and avoiding any possible outright insurgencies it has been advised not to completely purge these generals. For now at least..."
ukraine.82.a: "Loyalty has its rewards..."
ukraine.83.t: "Populyarnyy front"
ukraine.83.d: "The Popular Front is a common name used to refer to an unofficial coalition of left-wing forces, primarily composing of moderate social-democrats, socialists and vanguardists. Despite the conflicting views held by the factions they remain a united force primarily thanks to Khrushchev, whose cult like following amongst the peasantry has allowed himself and his allies to coerce the moderates into remaining loyal. For now Khrushchev has held back on previous radical promises such as the abolishment of the monarchy in order to appease the social democratic majority who wish for progressive change, his increasingly vague stances have helped maintain the Front’s unity whilst not completely rejecting the will of his hardcore supporters. The social-democratic majority also serves as a tool used by Khrushchev to appeal to Vasyl who would surely oppose co-operation had the vanguardists been given a larger platform."
ukraine.83.a: "Let us see how long this lasts..."

ukraine.85.t: "The Coronation"
ukraine.85.d: "Due to the nature of Vasyl’s death, his successor was unable to have a proper coronation. That was, until today when [ROOT.GetSuccessorName] was crowned King of all the Ukrainians by Metropolitan Mykola Boretskyi in the St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv. Today is a great day for all Ukrainians as we finally rid ourselves of the legacy of the old Kingdom."
ukraine.85.a: "What an exciting event!"
ukraine.86.t: "Mikhail Bulgakov Arrested!"
ukraine.86.d: "With our recent crackdown against the terrorist organisation 'Faith and Nation' better known as ViN in full swing, our loyal police officers have raided a suspected ViN safehouse and arrested the organisation’s leader, Mikhail Bulgakov. With him arrested, the organisation will likely crumble without any leadership."
ukraine.86.a: "Death to the enemies of the state!"
ukraine.87.t: "Dmytro Dontsov Arrested!"
ukraine.87.d: "With our recent crackdown against the terrorist Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists better known as the SUN in full swing, our loyal police officers have raided a suspected SUN safehouse and arrested the organisation’s leader, Dmytro Dontsov. With him arrested, the organisation will likely crumble without any leadership."
ukraine.87.a: "Death to the enemies of the state!"
ukraine.88.t: "Vasyl Calls for Snap Elections"
ukraine.88.d: "With no party attaining a majority in the Rada, King Vasyl, perhaps out of fear for a Syndicalist revolution, has called for snap elections across Ukraine, with voting to be held in one month’s time. There have also been raucous protests on the main square in Kyiv to ban the more extreme reactionary parties from the ballot in fears that they may jeopardize the integrity of the election."
ukraine.88.a: "Allow ballot access."
ukraine.88.b: "Take the reactionaries and Russian sympathizers off the ballot!"
ukraine.89.t: "The [GetYear] Rada Elections"
ukraine.89.d: "For the first time in Ukraine’s history, free elections are finally here at last and everyday Ukrainians are clamoring to have a voice in the government. The results are in, and the winner is..."
ukraine.89.a: "The social-democratic Federalist wing of the Ukrainian Party of Socialists."
ukraine.89.b: "The agrarian Peasant’s Party."
ukraine.89.c: "The national liberal People’s Party."
ukraine.89.e: "The Russophile Faith and Nation party."
ukraine.89.f: "The conservative Ukrainian National Democratic Party."
ukraine.89.g: "The far-right Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists."
ukraine.89.h: "The Christian-democratic Christian Social Movement in Ukraine."
ukraine.890.d: "The [GetYear] elections are finally upon us. Who shall take control?"
ukraine.90.t: "Skoropadskyi dissolves the Rada!"
ukraine.90.d: "Perhaps bolstered by success in the elections, the UND-controlled Rada has voted to dissolve the Supreme Rada once and for all, and instead replace them with a loyal State Senate, so Skoropadskyi and the UND never has to deal with any more challenges to his power. We have the popular mandate, after all."
ukraine.90.a: "No more of this 'election' nonsense."
ukraine.91.t: "A Rightist Coalition"
ukraine.91.d: "After much negotiation, we have decided to form a coalition in the Rada with Pavlo Skoropadskyi’s UND as well as a 'confidence and supply' agreement with our rivals on the right wing in order to keep the liberal and syndicalist parties from attaining a minority government and preserving the stability of the Kingdom. This should also prevent us from having to hold any more elections."
ukraine.91.a: "An unholy alliance."
ukraine.92.t: "The Fate of Extremist Parties"
ukraine.92.d: "The popular coalition government has served as a bulwark against extremism in this trying time for our nation. After the shocking death of the king who brought democracy to our nation, Syndicalists have been rounded up and banned from government in an effort to prevent those responsible from taking control in the next election. Meanwhile, the Nationalists have more or less become a fringe party and early polls are showing they will likely not reach the threshold to be on the ballot in the next election. Furthermore, reports coming out of Ukrainian newspapers discovered a plot by Pavlo Skoropadskyi to undermine Ukrainian democracy by dissolving the Rada had they received a majority in the previous election and as such have been banned from future elections."
ukraine.92.a: "Good riddance!"
ukraine.93.t: "Memories of the Republic"
ukraine.93.d: "While most of the country has been divided between the right-wing elite and the left-wing peasants, there is a growing contingent of middle-class Ukrainians who remember the days of the short-lived UPR, in which everyday people- not only the elites- had a voice in the government. Protests have been mounting in Kyiv in recent days to implement moderate reforms based on the model of Western democracies such as those found in Scandinavia, stopping short of a total governmental overhaul but instead calling for open elections to solve the deadlock in the Rada. While a minority of these protesters are ardent republicans, many seem open to the idea of retaining Vasyl as a constitutional monarch. One of Ukraine’s most prominent generals, Symon Petliura, has expressed their support for the protests, saying that allowing free elections to the Rada could go a long way to bridge the gap between left and right, and perhaps even solve the ongoing agricultural crisis."
ukraine.93.a: "Maybe it’s time to take them seriously."
ukraine.101.t: "An Overture from Kyiv"
ukraine.101.d: "With the recent declaration of an independent alliance between the Black and Baltic seas front in the form of the [ROOT.GetFactionName] by the Ukrainian nation, it seems that we have been invited to join their fold, bolstering their alliance of sovereign nations between the Austrian, German and Russian spheres."
ukraine.101.a: "We must join in brotherhood!."
ukraine.101.b: "We need no aid from the Ukrainians."
ukraine.102.t: "The [From.GetName] joins our cause!"
ukraine.102.d: "Great news in the capital today as following our offer to bring the [From.GetName] into the [ROOT.GetFactionName], we have received positive a positive response from them. Already, diplomats between them and us transit between Kyiv and their nation to discuss shared military affairs."
ukraine.102.a: "Splendid!."
ukraine.103.t: "The [From.GetName] refuses us!"
ukraine.103.d: "It would seem that our visit and invitation to the [From.GetName] has gone rather poorly, having only been rebuked upon their arrival. We will have to search for allies elsewhere."
ukraine.103.a: "We didn't need them anyway."
ukraine.103.t: "The German Empire falls to Revolution!"
ukraine.103.d: "In an extrodinary turn of events, the German nation, once the great bulwark against the communards and Russians alike now itself flies the colors of revolution!. Now we are stuck between the Anvil hammer of the Reds and Russians, we must secure Eastern Europe with our other former allies at once!."
ukraine.103.a: "Send the envoys!."

monsocukr.1.t: "A Bloody Red Morning"
monsocukr.1.d: "This morning at 8 sharp, King Vasyl I was shot and killed during his daily morning walk. Long preferring to walk alone without his usual accompaniment of guards, the fact something like this did not happen early is a bit shocking. The assassin, apprehended as soon as the shots were heard, was a member of the banned Communist Party of Ukraine, led by one Nikita Khrushchev, long an opponent of our regime. Despite this, the King’s death could not come at a more opportune time. Although supportive of our reforms, the King had yet to fully embrace the rebirth of the revolution. With his death, Leo Stefan von Habsburg, not yet even a teenager, has been chosen by our government to replace the late King. Due to him still having years before he can fully take on his responsibilities, Leo Stefan, now King Lev II, is a perfect match, as he can be shown the truths of our ideals and policies. The Kingdom may mourn the death of her late King, but with his death comes a new dawn for the nation, under the dual rule of the Monarchy and the People’s Government."
monsocukr.1.a: "The King is dead, Long Live the King!"

monsocukr.2.t: "The Case of the Khrushchevites"
monsocukr.2.d: "After months of preparation, the trial of Khrushchev, his closest allies, and his entire party apparatus has finally begun. Charged with conspiracy to assassinate the late King, the trial is a forgone conclusion. While all will get a chance to speak, present evidence and defend themselves, all know that  the Khrushchevites are doomed to swing.\n\nThe trial itself was a simple affair, and hearkened back to the various show trials that the Bolsheviks carried out in the final days of the Soviet uprising.  Each and every man was convicted of treason, with the rope waiting for Khrushchev and others. What’s more, the KMS has been formally banned, it’s assets seized and turned over to the People’s Government. While this was a small step, it is a necessary one, for to truly revitalize the nation, the rot must be purged out."
monsocukr.2.a: "So long you bastard. Good riddance."

monsocukr.3.t: "An Alliance for the Future of Ukraine"
monsocukr.3.d: "Of all the various political factions we find ourselves competing against within Ukraine, the National-Syndicalists, under the control of Oleksander Shumskyi, are the closest to us in terms of policy. Wishing to build a syndicalist state within a revived Ukraine is the gist of the their policy, and the similarities between our own program is quite striking. Seeing as how we both find ourselves adrift in a sea of hostile ideologies, it has been agreed that both of our parties should merge, allowing us to implement our programs all the easier. Mykhailo Yalovy, our foreign minister, is a personal friend of Shumskyi, thus making the merger all the easier.\n\nThis merger is, of course, not just for convenience, it also allows us to keep a closer eye on Shumskyi, as he is seen as a threat to our rule. Regardless, with the merger of our two parties, the future of Ukraine looks ever the brighter."
monsocukr.3.a: "Arm-in-arm, we work for the betterment of the nation."

monsocukr.5.t: "Against the Russian Menace"
monsocukr.5.d: "Of all the nations that have come to dominate our beloved homeland, none have been more horrid then that of the Russian bear.  Be it the subjaction of our people, the attempts to force us to become Russians or even the near-destruction of our culture, we have suffered more at the hands of the Russians then anyone else. No Longer! With a government that truly cares for the people finally in power within Ukraine, we shall reverse the table. Those Russians foolish enough to our lands shall be forced out, and driven back to 'Mother Russia.' Our Eastern lands shall be purified, and the same horror they inflicted on us will be inflicted upon them. When the time finally comes for us to stand against the Bear, we shall hold the line, for we know that a truly free Ukraine, by the People for the People, lives and dies with us!"
monsocukr.5.a: "Death to the Bear!"

monsocukr.6.t: "To Arms for Ukraine!"
monsocukr.6.d: "In the history of our great nation, figures such as Volodymyr the Great stand out as true heros to the national cause, These figures are known to every true son of Ukraine, and their model still serves as perfect examples for our armed forces. Bohdan Khmelnytskyi is one such man. Fighting against the oppressive rule of the Poles, Khmelnytskyi’s might established a free nation that we are the inheritors of such. In emulation of his legacy, and the government’s own promotion of men such like him, various militias of peasants have formed, and have begun attacking and seizing land from Polish nobles that inhabit the west of our country. While these raids have been fairly tame, it cannot be said they don't show what a rallied up people can do. Within the sized lands, the former palaces of the landowning Poles have been transformed into massive schools, greatly increasing education within our rural population. What’s more, the land sized has actually been handed over to government control by the people, giving us the chance to see it divided up correctly. With more raids planned or ongoing, it seems the people have finally found an outlet for years of oppression."
monsocukr.6.a: "A victory for the masses!"

monsocukr.7.t: "Terrorist Activity in Bessarabia!"
monsocukr.7.d: "Bessarabia has long been one of most contested areas of land, claimed  by both the Russians and Ukrainians, thus it is no surprise that both have hungrily eyed the land since the end of the Weltkrieg. While both have waited for a moment of weakness, waiting for us to slip up so they could size Bessarabia out from under us. It seems however, that this period of relative peace has ended. Over the course of the past few days, a string of terror attacks, carried out by what appears to be a contingent of Cossacks fighting what they claim is a 'modern day Yasir for the Ukrainian population in Bessarabia.'\n\nWhile we have no evidence besides hearsay, it is believed these Cossacks are agents of the 'Monarcho-Socialist' government in Kyiv. Seemingly confirming this, Kyiv has offered to subdue these terrorists, in exchange for 'temporary authority' over Bessarabia. In other words, they are demanding we hand over Bessarabia or the attacks will continue, if not all out war between our two nations. While such a war would no doubt be easily won, many within our government are calling for us to cave to Ukraine and to focus on reclaiming the rest of Greater Romania, saying we can always get the land back later. Whatever our choice, we must do something quickly, before even more lives are lost. "
monsocukr.7.a: "It will take more then terrorists for us to hand over our land!"
monsocukr.7.b: "Enough! The Ukrainians can have the land, it’s not worth the human toll."

monsocukr.8.t: "Failure of Operation Muromets"
monsocukr.8.d: "Despite our best attempts, our convert efforts to get Romanian to hand over Bessarabia peacefully, also known as Operation Muromets, has failed. Despite having no direct evidence to link our government to the various terrorist attacks and cells that formed as a result of our actions, the Romanian government clearly seems to know it was us, and has issued a stern 'warning' that any attempts to restore order within Bessarabia by our troops would be seen as an act of war. While the Operation was clearly a failure, that doesn't mean we can't capitalize on the chaos that reigns in Bessarabia to quickly seize it from Romania will a small war. Regardless, the operation was a failure, and the only remaining avenue to capture the land is by war, if that war comes sooner or later remains to be seen however."
monsocukr.8.a: "Death to Romania! We march for Greater Ukraine!"
monsocukr.8.b: "They've won this round, we'll be back..."

monsocukr.9.t: "An Offer from the South"
monsocukr.9.d: "Much like ourselves, the government of Ukraine has recently taken a great leap forward, emerging as a predominant People’s Government under the watchful eye of their King. Just like us, they have fallen adrift in a sea of conflicting ideologies and movements, however unlike when we first took up the mantle of the King and the People, a grouping of like minded nations exists, that of course being us and our Union of People’s Crowns. Seeking to latch onto a nation that shares ideals, the Ukrainian Government has formally petitioned to join the Union of People’s Crowns. Promising access to their vast grain resources, the Ukrainian delegation has promised that there is nothing to lose by granting them membership in the Union. Despite this, many wonder if they have alternative motives in this request, thus bringing their motivation for  joining into question."
monsocukr.9.a: "Of course! Long live the People’s Crowns!"
monsocukr.9.b: "What has Ukraine ever done for us? Rejected!"

monsocukr.10.t: "A Disappointing Response"
monsocukr.10.d: "Much to our disappointment, the People’s Government of White Ruthenia has denined our request to join the Union of People’s Crowns. While unexpected, this is expected to have little effect on the nation overall. Despite this, we once again find ourselves alone, with our backs to the wall. May God protect the Union, for we cannot."
monsocukr.10.a: "A setback for sure, but one we can recover from."

monsocukr.11.t: "The East Ablaze" 
monsocukr.11.d: "As predicted, the Russians and Russophiles who inhabit the east of our nation have not taken kindly to our efforts to remove their perfidious influence. What started as a series of spontaneous protests against our anti-russian policies has turned into riots, and in the worst case, all out insurgency. While this violence has no chance of succeeding in anything more then property damage,  it is a sign of just how deep the Bear was able to sink it’s claws into our nation. The armed forces are already preparing a plan to pacify the East; Those who rebel will be given two choices, return home and accept the righteous of the King and the People’s Government, or be driven to Russia, where they can finally be united with the 'Motherland'. Those who resist even this most generous offer will face our full wrath, knowing what it means to face the People’s justice. Either way, by the time we are done, Ukraine shall finally be free of the Russian Bear, after so long a time."
monsocukr.11.a: "Resistance is futile."

He studied at the University of Novorossiysk, first at the Natural Sciences Department, then at the Slavonic-Russian Department of History and Philology. After graduation, he worked for one year as a teacher of Russian language and literature, but soon left for Kyiv to work as an editor of the newspaper \"Rada\". He was also the secretary of the \"Prosvita\" in Odessa.\n\nAfter the Hetman came to power, he participated in the creation of the Ukrainian National Union, which was preparing a coup against Skoropadskyi and became its first head. However, in September he was replaced by Volodymyr Vynnychenko, after which the UNS turned into the Dyrektoria.\n\nNikovskyi collaborated with Serhiy Yefremov and worked with him in the Kyiv newspaper Rada.

During Weltkrieg he served at the front and was commissioned.\nIn 1919 he joined the Borotbysts, rising rapidly to the highest levels of the party. Hrynko differs from most of the Borotbysts in that he is not a revolutionary dreamer. Without party training or tradition, Hrynko is often regarded by the Borotbysts as a careerist, although he is generally respected for his integrity. "

After graduating from seminary, he enrolled at the Faculty of Natural Sciences at St. Petersburg University. In St. Petersburg fate brought him together with Mykola Porsh and Symon Petliura,. Soon he joined the USDRP, of which he later became one of the leaders.\n\nAfter the formation of the Ukrainian Central Rada, Isaak did much to develop the activities of Ukrainian parties and organizations in Yekaterinoslav province. During the Hetmanate, when the persecution of active Ukrainian movement members began in Yekaterinoslav, Mazepa, working in the provincial zemstvo council, tried to protect them. In October 1918, Mazepa was arrested for editing a social-democratic newspaper and soon was fired. With the formation of the Dyrektoria as the government of the UPR in exile, Mazepa went to Galicia, where he was elected to the Central Committee of the USDRP and became its secretary."
