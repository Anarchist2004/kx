###Bio###
POLITICS_PAVLO_SKOROPADSKYI_DESC:0 "Pavlo Skoropadskyi is many things: an opportunist, a cossack, a military officer, and a descendent of Ukrainian nobility. But most importantly, he is Hetman, the leader of Ukraine, whose power is disputed only by a King. Drawing his lineage from an 18th century Hetman of the Zaporizhian Host, Skoropadskyi rose up through Tsarist military ranks in a flash. During the Ukrainian Revolution, Pavlo Skoropadskyi became a chief organizer of specifically Ukrainian Army Corps and of the numerous Cossack Volunteer Units, all of which sought to combat pro-Bolshevik militias. An avid opponent of Socialism, Skoropadskyi started plotting against the Ukrainian People's Republic with his Capitalist, Landowning and Military allies before overthrowing the Republic on April 29th, 1918. This could not have been accomplished without the assistance of the Kaiser, and to repay him, Skoropadsky soon found himself in deep military and economic ties with Germany.\n\nChallenged only by a King, Vasyl, who is seen in the eyes of Hetman only as the compromise imposed by the Austrians. Anything deemed contrary to national interests is strictly forbidden and heavily persecuted. With the Soim weak and powerless, there is only a slight illusion of democracy in Ukraine."
POLITICS_VASYL_DESC:0 "Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen is known to many as King Vasyl Vyshyvani. By many he is regarded as a symbol of foreign dominance, imposed on Ukraine as a result of a compromise between Germany and Austria. However, the others know, that Vasyl is fascinated by Ukrainian culture, he writes and speaks Ukrainian, and there is not a single argument, except for his origin, that he is not worthy of the throne of Ukraine. Even before he became Vasyl Vyshyvani, he received the nickname \"The Red Prince\" for his desire to improve the living conditions of the poor Ukrainian population of Galicia. In fact, among the few legal parties of Ukraine sitting in the Soim, it is Vasyl who is being put faith on. However, with a stagnant economy, a dysfunctional bureaucracy, and most of all, tension with the influential Hetman and his SGD, Vasyl struggles to maintain authority."
POLITICS_NIKITA_KRUSCHEV_DESC:0 "Nikita Kruschev, authoritarian socialist, has become the premier of Ukraine. Kruschev, born to Russian peasants near the current Russian-Ukrainian border, harbours a deep disdain for the landowning Kulaks; he plans to eliminate the Kulaks as a social class through forced seizure and collectivisation of their land. Such measures, however, are unpopular among all but a small number of Ukrainians, which may force Kruschev to compromise."
POLITICS_LEO_STEFAN_DESC:0 "King Leo Stefan von Habsburg-Lothringen, while ethnically Austrian, has been raised in the Ukrainian culture. While to some, Leo's ascension is indicative of compromise between the Reichspakt and Ukraine, many lament the continued dominance of Ukraine by foreigners. The real compromise, these dissidents claim, was between Germany and Austria, who are now united in support for Leo. Domestically much of Leo's support comes from the powerful land-owning class who now control the Soim and who see the young king as little more than a puppet to illicit Austro-German support for their endeavours."
POLITICS_LEV_II_DESC:0 "Count Leo Stefan was born to the Habsburg-Lorraine family on June 12, 1928. Being groomed to potentially succeed to the throne of a Eastern European state, Leo ended up gaining a lot of knowledge and respect for Ukrainian customs. Eventually he would be raised to this position as Lev II once King Vasyl was killed by a communist, he now tries his best to represent Ukraine. This knowledge and actual attempt to help Ukraine was noticed by some socialists who wished to keep the stability of the crown yet bring forth leftist ideals. Being entangled within these ideals, Lev the II now reigns Ukraine as the People’s King, representing and supporting their struggles against those that would keep the peasantry, and wider Ukraine down."
POLITICS_DANIIL_I_DESC:0 "King Daniil Skoropadsky, son of the famous 'Hetman', has ascended to the Ukrainian throne. With the long power-struggle between the Hetman and the monarchy finally resolved, Ukraine breathes a sign of relief. Daniil however is quite rightly seen by many as little more than a puppet king, effectively allowing his father to the bulk of rulership while he himself acts as the front-man. Perhaps after Pavlo Skoropadsky's death will the young king finally be able to assert himself but for now the young king will do just as he is told."

POLITICS_MIKHAIL_BULGAKOV_DESC:0 "Mykhailo Bulhakov, an ethnic Russian born in the Kiev governate, was for much of his life known more so for his prolific writings and literary talents rather than politics. After finding himself heading up the russophile ViN organisation, he is now in charge of the government and has made his intentions clear that the so-called 'Free State of Ukraine' is little more than a temporary fixture until the nation can be annexed into the motherland once more."
POLITICS_DMITRI_DONTSOV_DESC:0 "Dmytro Dontsov has been are the forefront of Ukrainian nationalism for many years and has solidified his position as the primary nationalist ideologue in Ukraine. Having allied with Konovalets and his UVO, Dontsov has become powerful during the interwar and now finally ascended to a position of leadership with his intentions of driving out both German and Russian influences as well as a general crackdown against socialist activity."
POLITICS_YEVHEN_KONOVALETS_DESC:0 "Yevhen Konovalets is the recognizable leader of the Ukrainian nationalist movement and its prime military-political organization, the UVO. His biography is the history of Ukrainian Independence, its struggle for national identity and sovereignity.\n\nBorn in the village near Lemberg, Austria-Hungary, Konovalets was always connected to the Ukrainian national movement. In the pre-Weltkrieg years he became an active member of the Prosvita becoming the secretary of the Lemberg Department, the Ukrainian educational association, In 1913 he met Dmytro Dontsov and became greatly influenced by the nationalist ideology and rhetoric. \n\nConscripted to the Austro-Hungarian Army during the war, he became prisoner-of-war in Russia, where he joined a group of former Galician officers together with Andrii Melnyk, eventually fleeing to Kyiv together. Serving for the independent Ukrainian Republic, he organized the division of Sich Streltsy and later assumed its command, effectively suppressing the Bolshevik uprising in Kyiv and resisting the Communist offensive.\n\nHe soon became the Colonel of Army and the Sich Streltsy regiment of Konovalets were considered one of the most combat-ready units of the Ukrainian army.\n\nEverything changed when the Hetmanate has risen. The regiment was disarmed and disbanded at the request of German command only to Konovalets receiving permission from Hetman Skoropadsky to form a separate detachment of Sich Streltsy as part of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian state in Bila Tserkva a few months later. The command of the created unit was opposed to the Hetman, but remained faithful to the oath given to the Hetman.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Konovalets, together with Andrii Melnyk and Dmytro Dontsov formed the UVO - a nationalistic organisation, which proclaimed its goal to create a conciliar independent Ukrainian state on ethnic Ukrainian lands with a supreme leader, Konovalets, as its head."
POLITICS_VYACHESLAV_LYPYNSKY_DESC:0 "Vyacheslav Lypynskyi is known to be the main ideologue of the new Ukrainian statehood, the Hetman Movement, the Ukrainian Conservatism, or as he called it himself, the 'theory of Ukrainian Hetman Nationalism'. Despite this, he is a staunch critic of the Hetmanate, as he confronts Skoropadskyi’s desire to become the absolute monarch of Ukraine, as well as he sharply criticizes the radical 'integral nationalism' of Dontsov.\n\nBeing leader of the USKhD, a party once created to support the Hetman, Lypynskyi is soon to find himself among the other oppositional parties and main enemies of the Hetmanate regime."
POLITICS_ANDRIY_MELNYK_DESC:0 "Andriy Melnyk, colonel of the Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic, one of the closest associates of Yevhen Konovalets, as well as one of the organizers of the Ukrainian Military Organization. Since the late 1920s, by order of Konovalets, he was in Galicia, where he represented the UVO, engaged in propaganda of Ukrainian nationalism and distributed anti-Austrian and anti-Polish leaflets.\n\nA staunch nationalist, proponent of the Ukrainian Natiocracy, Melnyk is seen as less radical than Dontsov and Konovalets, focusing more on militarism and centralisation, than on fierce radical nationalism."
POLITICS_DMYTRO_DOROSHENKO_DESC:0 "For Hetman - Doroshenko is a loyal subject, for nationalists - a liberal, and for the Central Committee of the UPR in exile - he is a traitor. \n\nOnce a member of the UPSF, shortly after Hetman Skoropadsky came to power, Doroshenko became one of the leaders of the Hetman movement, Minister of Foreign Affairs and the main representative of the interests of the national democratic forces. Having created the USKhD together with Lypynsky, Doroshenko was expelled from the party by the end of the 1920s. This was due to the ideological split between Lypynskyi and the Hetman. Doroshenko created the UDP and remained one of the few supporters of Skoropadskyi, although he held more democratic views. Perhaps one day, he will be able to implement them without conflicting with the interests of the Hetman."
POLITICS_DMYTRO_LEVYTSKY_DESC:0 "Dmytro Levytskyi was born in the Lemberg region of Austria-Hungary, in 1877. He completed law school at the University of Vienna and during Weltkrieg served as an officer in the army of Austria-Hungary. Captured by the Russians in 1915, he spent the remainder of the war in Tashkent. Returning to Ukraine as the Russian Empire fell apart, Levytskyi hoped that the Austria-Hungary will fell, finally allowing for the West Ukrainians to unite with the rest of the country. Unfortunately, it did not happen. Forced to exile, as many democratic leaders, Levytskyi soon established the UNDO together with Mikhnovskyi, becoming his only ally.\n\nNow, when the UNDO finally stays triumphant in the mainland Ukraine, Levytskyi will do all his best to create a constitutional democratic republic with strong national identity."
POLITICS_MYKOLA_MIKHHNOVSKY_DESC:0 "'Mykola Mikhnovskyi is a Ukrainian elemental force,... which is restrained only by a strong and noble mind. He was a highly educated and experienced lawyer, a subtle psychologist, a successful initiator, an outstanding organizer, a brilliant speaker, a talented publicist, an intelligent and tactful leader, an intuitive military commander, an excellent connoisseur of our past, our history and everyday life, a typical revolutionary, that is, a person capable of decisive action. Brought up in good Ukrainian traditions, raised in a Ukrainian village, Mykola Mikhnovsky was a model of Ukrainian racial culture, a Ukrainian aristocrat in all meanings of this concept.' - is the most flattering description of Mykola Mikhnovsky.\n\nIn fact, the reality is somewhat different. All his life Mikhnovsky defended ideas that were not supported by the majority. He has gained a strong reputation as a complex person with whom it is difficult to communicate. Extreme demands narrowed the circle of his friends: only those who shared his views became close.\n\nAn opponent of the policy of the Central Rada, a supporter of Skoropadskyi's coup, Mikhnovsky, unfortunately, turned out to be on the other side of the barricades against his will.\n\nDespite the negative reviews, the Hetman seriously considered Mikhnovsky as a candidate for the post of Prime Minister of the Ukrainian state. He was impressed by anti-socialist views and his recognition of the right of peasants to private ownership of land. However, Pavlo Skoropadskyi was eventually persuaded not to appoint Mikhnovsky as prime minister, and he offered him the position of his personal adviser. The ambitious Mikhnovskyi, of course, refused this, which foretold his future fate.\n\nMykola Mikhnovsky made a lot of efforts to transform the Hetman's political regime into a truly popular Ukrainian government. He was the author of a series of documents criticizing the composition of the government and its policies, subordinated directly to the Hetman. Mikhnovskyi was part of the delegations that appealed to the German occupation authorities. Not trusting the socialists, Mikhnovskyi did not support the idea of a mass anti-Hetman uprising. In the end, all his attempts led to the fact that he was expelled from Ukraine, where he joined Levytskyi and became one of the co-founders of the UNDO, without losing hope of returning to Kyiv."

POLITICS_SYMON_PETLIURA_DESC:0 "A native of Poltava, Symon Petliura, is known as an impulsive person, prone to noisy effects, yet pragmatic and rational. A member of USDRP, rather socialist-minded politician became the first military minister of the Ukrainian People's Republic, the creator of the first national armed forces of Ukraine. Unlike his fellow party member Vynnychenko, Petliura believed that only a professional regular army will help to win Ukrainian independence. With his special regiment of Haidamaks, Petliura played a major role in suppressing the 'Arsenal' industrial plant and liquidation of last remnants of Bolshevik uprising.\n\nAfter the Hetman's Coup, Petliura together with other social-democrats began to establish shadow structures of opposition across the country, preparing an armed uprising against Skoropadskyi. But as most socialist leaders were arrested or exiled, the uprising never happened and Petliura was forced to flee to Galicia-Lodomeria.\n\nBeing one of the leaders of the exiled forces, Petliura patiently waits for the right moment for a coup. But should the socialists once again turn against Ukrainians, Petliura can use his connections in the army for his own good."
POLITICS_VOLODYMYR_VYNNYCHENKO_DESC:0 "Volodymyr Vynnychenko is considered by many as a founding father of Ukrainian statehood, together with Mykhailo Hrushevskyi. An author of almost all official declarations and legislation of the Ukrainian People's Republic, he also became the first prime-minister of this formally sovereign short-lived state.\n\nAfter the Hetman's Coup, he was arrested by the new government for trumped-up charges. in the preparation of a coup d'etat. However, the German administration pressured Skoropadskyi to liberate him, frightened by the possibility of political destabilisation. He became the leader of the alliance of Ukrainian socialist parties, planning to organize an armed uprising against Skoropadskyi’s dictatorship with the help of Russian Bolsheviks. However, his plans were doomed to failure, and, miraculously avoiding another arrest, together with other former UPR leaders, Vynnychenko fled to Galicia and headed the UPR government in exile.\n\nAlong with Symon Petliura, he is one of the leaders of the upcoming uprising against the Hetman regime, but will he be able to hold off another attempt to create a socialist republic in Ukraine?"

A former member of the Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries, a revolutionary, he soon became the leader of the radical left-wing of the UPSR, who advocated radical views on social and agrarian matters, similar to those of the Bolsheviks and Russian Left SRs.\n\nAfter the coup, Shumskyi defended the course to unfold the struggle against Hetmanate, rapprochement with Bolsheviks, establishing a Soviet Ukrainian state with active Ukrainisation. However, the Bolsheviks have been defeated both in Russia and Ukraine, and Shumskyi, together with the newly created Ukrainian Communist Party of Borotbists, began his active work to destroy the Hetmanate from inside and liberate the Ukrainian peasants and workers."
POLITICS_MYKOLA_STSIBORSKYI_DESC:0 "Mykola Stsiborskyi is an interesting figure in the Ukrainian political scene. A veteran of the Weltkrieg and Russian Civil War, captain in the cavalry of the UPR army, he has a revolutionary temperament and true patriotic feelings for his Motherland.\n\nStsiborskyi supported Skoropadskyi’s coup and managed to build a brilliant military career. He joined the UVO and later became a staunch critic of democracy and one of the ideologists of Ukrainian nationalism. Together with Melnyk, he started UVO propaganda campaign in Galicia-Lodomeria. However, he soon became disenchanted with the state of affairs both in Hetmanate and Ukrainian regions of Galicia-Lodomeria.\n\nAbroad, he met with Mussolini and Mosley and his ideological shift towards Totalism became evident. He understood, that only with a revolutionary spirit, in a republican national-syndicalist system, adapted to the interests of Ukrainian nationalism, with a combined authoritarian-decentralized management system, the revival of Ukraine is possible."

UKR_breadbasket_of_europe_idea_desc:0 "Ukraine is predominantly an agrarian country, with large rural population. With new infrastructure and technological advancement, Ukraine's agricultural output, already substantial, has grown to become one of the largest in Europe. Ukrainian produce permeates throughout Europe, and perhaps no meal is eaten that hadn't at least partially originated in Ukraine; Ukraine has now truly become the breadbasket of Europe."
UKR_agricultural_crisis_idea:0 "Agricultural Crisis"
UKR_agricultural_crisis_idea_desc:0 "With the introduction of increased tariffs by Mitteleurope, our country is facing a serious crisis in agriculture. Deliveries of modern equipment from Germany have stopped, and bread has to be delivered at undervalued prices. As a result, we are faced with an overabundance of agricultural products that cannot meet the demand. On the one hand, the agricultural crisis has provoked an increase in unemployment, as some farms have declared bankruptcy, but more seriously, this year's sowing may fail and potentially lead to famine."

ukrpol.1.t:0 "Our Kingdom"
ukrpol.1.d:0 "The Ukrainian State declared its independence with the support of Germany on April 28, 1918, when, as a result of a coup against the left-leaning Central Rada, the initial experiment with socialism in the form of a People's Republic was canceled. Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, a strong-willed man and a former general of the Russian army, who set the tone for the future of Ukraine, came to power. This state of affairs was soon ratified by the Brest-Litovsk peace agreement.\n\nUkraine was to become a breadbasket used by the military aristocratic elite from all over Eastern Europe as a source of food, a convenient market for goods and a military bulwark against the weakened Russian Republic. Skoropadskyi relied on large landowners, the old bureaucracy and officers and sought to build a new Ukrainian monarchy with himself at the head. The leaders of the People's Republic were expelled from the country, and their parties were banned, but they were able to establish a government in exile in neighboring Galicia-Lodomeria, where a significant part of Ukrainians lived.\n\nHowever, German aid soon turned into payment of informal debts to the allies for the Hetman. For some time, the dispute between Germany and its Austro-Hungarian ally continued after the Weltkrieg, eventually settling on a compromise according to which King Vasyl, the Austrian Archduke Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, would rule with the support of Skoropadskyi, who, as a German-allied \"Hetman\", has incredible powers both in civil and military matters. on military matters. In fact, the Hetman still remained practically the sole ruler of Ukraine, limited only by the King and the Soim, which is increasingly dissatisfied with Skoropadskyi's policy.\n\nNow, almost twenty years after the Weltkrieg, the situation in the country is unstable. The Reich forces us to sell our goods almost exclusively to countries within its sphere of influence, while syndicalists are gaining popularity every day among the oppressed rural poor and urban workers. Despite these many problems we face, our land is prosperous and fertile, our people are hardworking, and our potential is limitless."

State administration was carried out by the Government appointed by him. Pavlo Skoropadskyi was proclaimed the guarantor of order and legality before the elections of the Ukrainian Soim. \n\nHowever, everything changed in 1922. As a result of the compromise of Germany with Austria-Hungary, the political system of the Hetmanate changed. Austrian Archduke Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, was crowned in Kyiv as King Vasyl, elections were held to the new Ukrainian Soim. As a result of all this, the Hetman's power was limited, although he continued to be the supreme leader and commander-in-chief, and none of the decisions were made without his approval. The parties of the Soim that existed under strict control soon became quite oppositional and stopped seeing the Hetman as the only possible ruler of Ukraine. His desire for sole power rejected them and hindered the emerging ideology of Ukrainian monarchism and conservatism, which saw the Hetman as an exclusively symbolic figure.\n\nThe Hetman sees the future of Ukraine only in increasing his own power and turning the country into a real Hetmanate with himself at the head. And there would be practically no obstacles to this if it were not for the Soim and the King."

ukrpol.3.d:0 "Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen is known to many as King Vasyl Vyshyvani. By many he is regarded as a symbol of foreign dominance, imposed on Ukraine as a result of a compromise between Germany and Austria. However, the others know, that Vasyl is fascinated by Ukrainian culture, he writes and speaks Ukrainian, and there is not a single argument, except for his origin, that he is not worthy of the throne of Ukraine. Even before he became Vasyl Vyshyvani, he received the nickname \"The Red Prince\" for his desire to improve the living conditions of the poor Ukrainian population of Galicia.\n\nFor almost 15 years, the Hetman of Ukraine has been doing everything to marginalize the King, and not giving him the opportunity to show his best side. Therefore, the only support and hope of Vasyl is Austria and the Ukrainian Soim. Of the several parties sitting there, namely the UMP, USKhD and UDP, Vasyl has long been an integral figure of the new Ukrainian Statehood. Having got rid of the Hetman, the authorities in the country will finally be able to rely on the ideas of Ukrainian Conservatism, maybe even allow Vasyl to throw off the foreign stigma of the \"King\" and become a real Hetman of Ukraine."

ukrpol.4.d:0 "The economy of Ukraine is predominantly agrarian. In 1918, Land commissions were established, including the Supreme Land Commission, chaired by Skoropadskyi, to resolve land disputes and develop a land reform project.\n\nA stable currency and tax system were established, the state budget was developed and executed, State and Land Banks were created. Private land ownership, including the one for the large landowners, was restored, the peasants' ownership of land was confirmed with the allocation and sale of communal lands, which contributed to the formation of a broad class of medium-sized landowners. However, the state grain monopoly imposed by the Germans remained. The Skoropadskyi’s government relied on the restoration of large landlords and middle peasant farms, in which the German-Austrian occupation authorities were also interested. Supporting the Hetman, the landlords declared that small peasant farms were not able to provide large-scale commercial production of agricultural products, as demanded by war-ravaged Germany and Austria-Hungary from Ukraine. The soon-established supplies of industrial goods and agricultural implements to Ukraine from these countries helped ease the tense political and socio-economic situation in Ukrainian society.\n\nBy 1936, Ukraine had become one of the most promising economies in Europe, receiving a lot of money and investments from European powers. Industrial enterprises were restored and new ones were gradually created. However, there is only one fear - what if Europe stops buying our bread?"

The almost unaffordable demands for grain supplies from Austria and Germany led to the fact that the peasants had practically nothing left, which led to the aggravation of their situation, the strengthening of opposition to the Hetman, the growth of anarchism, banditry and crime. Fortunately, famine was avoided then. If we do not terminate our contracts with Germany now, which actually provide benefits for trade with us to all the countries of Mitteleurope, we may find ourselves in a similar situation again. It is necessary to act immediately, while Germany is weak and cannot fight back against us.

The main part of Kupala rituals is performed at night. It is considered mandatory for the holiday to swim before sunset. Closer to sunset, bonfires are lit on the hills or by the rivers. On the night of Ivan Kupala, the "betrothed" are chosen and marriage rites are performed: jumping over the fire, holding hands, exchanging wreaths, searching for a fern flower and bathing in the morning dew.\n\nDespite the fact that official events with the participation of high-ranking officials are not held, ordinary Ukrainian people in villages celebrate this ancient holiday with pleasure."

ukrmisc.3.t:0 "'Ivan Ilyich'"
ukrmisc.3.d:0 "A new play by Mikhaylo Bulhakov, \"Ivan Ilyich\", appeared today on the posters. The plot is based on castling in time, when due to a malfunction of the machine invented by engineer Tymofeenko, the Kiev housekeeper Koretskyi, together with the crook Zhorzh Myloslavskyi, move to the XVIII century, and Hetman Ivan Skoropadskyi falls into the XX century. Almost vaudeville confusion leads to the creation of numerous comic situations in which the characters, who find themselves in \"alien\" eras, live according to the laws of their time. \n\nIt turns out that Koretskyi is surprisingly similar to the Hetman, which is noticed by Myloslavskyi, who, posing as Prince Golytsyn, convinces Koretskyi to play the role of Hetman. Koretskyi, being an ardent supporter of modern politics, causes insurmountable horror among the Cossacks by publicly renouncing Peter the Great and his 'Muscovy' and declaring an alliance with the Teutons.\n\nAt the same time in XX Century Kyiv, Hetman Skoropadskyi at first rejoices to learn that his descendant rules the country, but then he is horrified to learn that the Austrian Archduke is sitting at the head of the country as a King, and German garrisons are walking around the city. \n\nThe play ends with everything falling back into place, and Tymofeenko wakes up. However, the ending remains open, giving viewers to wonder if all this really happened."

Critics have already praised the film, saying that it is the best that the director has shot in his career.\n\nDovzhenko declared himself as an interesting and original master in 1928 with the film \"Zvenyhora\", where episodes of Ukrainian history were intertwined with scenes of the Civil War, where revolutionary epic, satire and lyrics were combined. According to critics, "Zvenyhora" marked the birth of Ukrainian cinema as an art. In 1929, Dovzhenko shot \"Arsenal\", the story of the uprising of the workers of the Kyiv factory in 1918. Then he himself took part in those riots, though on the other side, but in the film he seems to repent that he was blinded by Bolshevik fairy tales. In this film Dovzhenko continued to create his own unique language at the junction of poetic and realistic cinema. In terms of the scope and epicness of the action, Arsenal is not inferior to Zvenyhora - masses of people, many ordinary deaths and one grandiose one in the finale of the film, when the hero takes a blow from the enemy with his bare chest."

Apparently, impressionable German viewers remember last year's tour of the countries of Mittel Europe and Austria-Hungary, with sold-out tickets and full stalls and amphitheaters. This year the triumph was repeated.\n\nThe National Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine will be a real creative laboratory of Ukrainian composers and conductors.

Already in the autumn of 1917, the gang of a Yaponchik made a number of daring raids, including robbing a Romanian gambling club during the day. On New Year's Day in 1918, Goldstein's store and the sugar factory owner Yu. Gepner were robbed.\n\nAt the same time, Yaponchik organized the so-called Jewish Revolutionary Self-Defense Squad under the pretext of fighting possible pogroms and issued a \"proclamation\" calling for robbing \"only the bourgeoisie and officers.\" In November 1917, one of the robbers was even killed by the Yaponchik himself for robbing a worker.\n\nHe established contacts with the Odessa anarchist movement and in early December 1917, a group of so-called \"anarchist-rippers\" (\"rippers off the bourgeoisie\") appeared in Odessa, who staged a powerful explosion on Deribasovskaya Street in 1917, demanding an end to lynching of captured bandits. Later the bandits seized Eisenberg's brothel on Dvoryanskaya Street, setting up their headquarters there.\n\nIn January 1918, Yaponchik's squad, together with the Bolsheviks, anarchists and left SRS, participated in street battles. The bandits took advantage of these events to raid the Registration Bureau of the police, during which a card file for 16 thousand Odessa criminals was burned.\n\nAt the beginning of 1919, he actively collaborated with the Bolshevik underground. During the Civil War, the Yaponchik gang committed many new daring robberies, also engaged in kidnappings and racketeering. A number of entrepreneurs who did not want to pay the bandits were killed. In February 1919, a daring raid was made on a Civil public meeting of Odessa during a gala dinner, the apartment of Duchess Lyubomirskaya and the room of the Spanish consul at the Londonskyi Hotel were also robbed.\n\nYaponchik invested the money earned from crime in real business: he bought the most luxurious restaurant in Odessa. A casino and a brothel functioned under him.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, this open banditry of Yaponchik ended and he lay low, successfully eluding the Derzhavna Varta.

With the help of the cultural and educational society §l\"Prosvita\", the §MDyrektoria spreads anti-monarchist sentiments in society and the army.\n\nWith the departure of the German garrison, the probability of a successful uprising on the territory of the Hetmanate is beyond doubt.

UKR_Stabilize_Hryvnia_desc:0 "For the first time, hryvnia was released into circulation on October 17, 1918. Initially, the hryvnia was supposed to play the role of domestic loan bonds. However, the shortage of banknotes in circulation led to the fact that both bonds and individual coupons began to be used as money at the beginning of 1919. During this time, the economy has stabilized and many of the efforts of former Finance Minister Anton Rzhepetskyi to stabilize the national Ukrainian currency have been justified. However, due to Black Monday, the situation has worsened. Urgent measures must be taken to stabilize the Hryvnia!"
UKR_deposit_protection_law:0 "Empower Derzhavnyi Bank"
UKR_deposit_protection_law_desc:0 "By 1936, a wide network of credit and banking institutions with a multi-level structure was created in the country, which covered all branches of the agrarian-industrial economy of the region. It ensured the normal movement of goods, money and credit resources, although its power was significantly inferior to similar systems of industrial and industrial-agrarian countries of Western Europe. However, now our system needs additional support from the state. By giving extra powers to the Derzhavnyi (State) Bank, we can make sure it can bail out failing commercial banks."
UKR_Rural_Credit_Banks:0 "Rural Credit Banks"
UKR_Rural_Credit_Banks_desc:0 "With the agricultural crisis raging, credit is not a popular thing in the rural areas. The State Land Bank refused to give credits directly to the farms, being on the edge of default.

UKR_Continue_The_Mechanisation_Efforts:0 "Regional Tractor Stations"
UKR_Continue_The_Mechanisation_Efforts_desc:0 "In the modern day and age, hand tools and ploughs are being replaced by tractors and machines.

UKR_Invest_In_KhTZ:0 "Open the Kharkiv Tractor Plant"
UKR_Invest_In_KhTZ_desc:0 "As part of our agricultural mechanisation process, we need the industry to support it as demand for tractors, spare parts, and maintenance sharply rise. Thankfully, the KhTZ, a constructed tractor factory will specialize in this industrial sector. We should finish the constructing and aid the new complex so that they will be able to meet these growing demands with more ease."
UKR_Resume_Cash_Crop_Exportation:0 "Resume Cash Crop Exportation"
UKR_Resume_Cash_Crop_Exportation_desc:0 "Ukraine retains a very agrarian economy, but the recent economic troubles did severe damage to our major agricultural exports. With the economy market prices largely stabilised, we can resume agricultural exports and invest these profits."
UKR_Nationalize_NUSK:0 "Nationalise NUSK"
UKR_Nationalize_NUSK_desc:0 "The German-Ukrainian Agricultural Commission, an organisation, that ensured Ukrainian crops will reach the customers in Mitteleuropa, has been established in 1923, with the majority of shares be German.

UKR_rural_development:0 "Rural Infrastructure Initiatives"
UKR_rural_development_desc:0 "The Ukrainian countryside continues to struggle, many regions remain destitute, and the Black Monday Crisis has not given it any favours. We must dedicate investment to roads and irrigation in the countryside to improve the life of the poor average peasant!"

UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery_desc:0 "Social problems always provoke political instability. Lots of peasants join Syndicalist, nationalist or Russian separatist movements because of awful living conditions. If we want to save Ukraine from collapse, we should start a recovery programme and help the poorest grain-growers in Central Ukraine, providing our population with the cheap electricity they require. For this, we need cash."
UKR_First_Loan:0 "German Loan For Electrification"
UKR_First_Loan_desc:0 "We should ask Germany for a loan, which we will be able to use for the electrification of the the poorest grain-growers. By doing so we will improve their living conditions and help modernise their production methods. They must understand that the situation in Ukraine is unstable and it is important to help us, since we secure German interests in the East."
UKR_First_TaxHike:0 "Taxes For The Electrification"
UKR_First_TaxHike_desc:0 "We must use our own resources and raise taxes, since there is no other way to get investment for the programme of the electrification of the villages in the Central Ukraine. We hope that our peasants will understand us."

UKR_Electrification_desc:0 "Our government has finally been able to electrify all the villages in Central Ukraine. As a result our peasants will be able to produce more agricultural goods and supplies. Now we also need more resources, to fuel our nation's recovery and create the tools to do it."
UKR_Second_Loan:0 "German Loan For Industrialisation"
UKR_Second_Loan_desc:0 "We have improved the situation in Central Ukraine - it's time to do something in the Eastern part of the country.

UKR_Yekaterinoslav_Industry:0 "Invest in Katerinoslav"
UKR_Yekaterinoslav_Industry_desc:0 "Despite Kharkov is a nice place to develop our industy, its closeness to the Russian borders can become truly a disadvantage. Instead, we shall relocate our efforts to the Katerinoslav region, in the central part of our country."
UKR_Stab_econ:0 "Invest in the Western Regions"

UKR_progressive_taxation:0 "Implement Progressive Taxation"
UKR_progressive_taxation_desc:0 "It is not fair that an impoverished peasant, a toiling worker and a wealthy businessman all pay the same portion of their salary to the treasury.

UKR_traditional_agrarianism:0 "Promote Traditional Agrarianism"
UKR_traditional_agrarianism_desc:0 "As we progress to the modern era, we must never forget that human beings are naturally attached to the land, and prosper the most as individual landholders in the countryside.

UKR_grain_trade_monopoly_desc:0 "To ensure that the Bulgarian peasantry have access to fair grain sales and purchases, instead of being ripped off by greedy salesmen, the state shall legislate a monopoly in this sector. All sale and purchase of grain in the country shall be controlled by state-owned corporations which will keep the interests of the peasantry in mind."
UKR_protect_labor_rights:0 "Enforce Labour Rights Legislation"
UKR_protect_labor_rights_desc:0 "We must not only expand labour rights in Bulgaria, reducing the daily working hours, promoting unionisation and limiting dangerous labour, but we must also establish a system which enforces this legislation. Audits and independent ombudsmen will crack down on offending businesses and ensure that the rights of labour truly are protected."
UKR_state_production_monopolies:0 "Establish State Production Monopolies"
UKR_state_production_monopolies_desc:0 "Certain sections of the economy are too dangerous for private businesses to control and must be placed under sole state supervision. State production monopolies will ensure that prices are kept low and the interests of the people are always kept in mind."
UKR_free_trade_unions:0 "Empower the Free Trade Unions"
UKR_free_trade_unions_desc:0 "The Free Trade Unions are the trade union organisation of the Social Democratic Workers' Party, and represent the socialist side of legal organised labour in Bulgaria. We must empower this organisation by merging smaller trade unions into its aegis and prioritising its interests in business-union negotiations."
UKR_renew_urban_centres:0 "Renew Urban Centres"
UKR_renew_urban_centres_desc:0 "The urban populations of Sofia, Plovdiv, Burgas, Ruse and other cities are our arm of electoral support, hence we shall benefit them with additional funding. Urban centres shall be renewed and land clearances will allow cities to expand further into the countryside."
UKR_right_to_wealth:0 "The Right to Wealth"
UKR_right_to_wealth_desc:0 "Who are we to deny a thrifty, clever man the fruits of his labour? If he has established a business and built up sizeable wealth, then we can only endorse him and show him as an example, instead of taking that wealth away. After all, it is the businessman who creates jobs and employs those down-trodden."

UKR_agrarian_syndicalism_desc:0 "Who dares to say that Syndicalism can only be accomplished in cities, among industrial workers?

Those who work the land can follow Syndicalist principles of union supremacy and liberty just as well as their proletarian brothers!"
UKR_land_socialization:0 "Socialisation of the Land"
UKR_land_socialization_desc:0 "This land is our land. We shall begin to steer away from private land ownership and turn all land into property owned by the people.

A federal congress of communal representatives will replace the dilapidated Sŭbranie."
UKR_french_practices:0 "Replicate French Institutions"
UKR_french_practices_desc:0 "Though the Commune of France is based upon industrial unions, their experience in creating a practical Syndicalist state will be invaluable.

UKR_collective_economy:0 "Communal Economic Organisation"
UKR_collective_economy_desc:0 "We must abandon the bourgeois concepts of profit-making and exploitation.

UKR_revolutionary_spirit_desc:0 "Since times immemorial, the Bulgarian peasantry has possessed a revolutionary spirit.

This spirit shall be rejuvenated, and the Bulgarian peasantry prepare to export their revolutionary vigour abroad!"
UKR_village_militias:0 "Village Worker Militias"
UKR_village_militias_desc:0 "All communes in Syndicalist Bulgaria shall establish militias, and all peasantry will be trained to use weapons. In the case of foreign invasion, these militias will be our last line of defence, making the occupation of our plains and mountains hell for any tyrant."
UKR_modernization_priority:0 "Drive for Industrial Modernity"
UKR_modernization_priority_desc:0 "An agrarian state must become a modern, industrial state with a large proletariat before it can advance into socialism. We shall accomplish just that.

UKR_anti_clericalism:0 "Escalate the Anti-Clerical Struggle"
UKR_anti_clericalism_desc:0 "The Orthodox Church is an enemy of the socialist revolution, opportunistically endorsing the Monarchist regime and agitating against our revolutionary government.

UKR_Invite_Khrushchev:0 "Invite Khrushchev Into Government"
UKR_Invite_Khrushchev_desc:0 "Nikita Khrushchev, a well-known but controversial Ukrainian social-democrat, proposes the populist idea, very popular among the peasants, of the reorganisation of our agriculture. We have to admit, that that this proposition seems like it can help Ukraine in her time of crisis. Maybe we should invite him into government to implement these reforms?"
UKR_Popular_Front:0 "Popular Front"
UKR_Popular_Front_desc:0 "Though we have given Khrushchev free reign to reorganise the economy, many of our legislators in the Rada have prevented any attempt by Khrushchev to reduce the power of the Kulak landlords. That's why Khrushchev has announced a creation of the 'Popular Front', which will unite left members of the Supreme Rada and give him enough authority to change the laws."
UKR_Language_Issue:0 "Solve The Language Issue"
UKR_Language_Issue_desc:0 "The Russian language is widespread in Ukraine and the native tongue of many of our citizens, but it has never been an official state language. If we grant Russian a formal role in the Ukrainian state, it will allow us to gain popularity among pro-Russian citizens and solve one of the divisive issues our nation faces."
UKR_Exp_Kulaks:0 "Expropriate Kulak Holdings"
UKR_Exp_Kulaks_desc:0 "'Kulaks' or 'Kurkuls' is a category of relatively affluent farmers who are able to hire a lot of the poorest peasants and thus earn an enormous amount of money. Since they are hated by the majority of the peasants, we can easily expropriate they lands and divide them between the poorest peasants in the country."
UKR_Tax_Kulaks:0 "Increase Kulak Taxation"
UKR_Tax_Kulaks_desc:0 "'Kulaks' or 'Kurkuls' is a category of relatively affluent farmers who are able to hire a lot of the poorest peasants and thus earn an enormous amount of money. Since they are the only group of the farmers that are still able to fulfil our consumer needs, it would be wise to let them have their lands, but to impose an additional tax on them."
UKR_Coll_Prog:0 "Collectivisation"
UKR_Coll_Prog_desc:0 "After the latest agricultural crisis among the 'Kulaks', we have many new poor peasants all over Ukraine. Khrushchev proposes that they can work on new collective farms and produce goods for the state, which will provide them with farming tools and pay them a reasonable salary. This should hopefully, through pooling of resources, boost our total output."
UKR_Fate_Monarchy:0 "Fate of the Monarchy"
UKR_Fate_Monarchy_desc:0 "King Vasily has become somewhat of a laughing stock to the Ukrainian people. By handing major powers to Krushchev and seeing more issues solved in months than the King himself had resolved in years he has only highlighted his own irrelevance. A former Austrian puppet king with no Austrian backing, his position is being openly debated by Popular Front members."
UKR_Syn_Rev:0 "A Red Hetman"
UKR_Syn_Rev_desc:0 "As the great Hetman Bogdan Khmelnitskyi, who once liberated people on both banks of the Dnieper from the Polish yoke, once did; Nikita Khrushchev and the Popular Front deposed the King, the Hetman, and purged the Rada of all elements not willing to embrace the new reality. Finally the people of Ukraine are ready to build new society, one both proud and free!"
UKR_Friendship_Nations:0 "Unite the People"
UKR_Friendship_Nations_desc:0 "The capitalists did their best to divide the people of Ukraine, imposing chauvinism and intolerance on the national minorities of our country. But new leadership with Khrushchev is ready to fight this deception and will encourage a policy of unity amongst all citizens of this great nation!"
UKR_Khrushchyovka:0 "'Khrushchyovka'"
UKR_Khrushchyovka_desc:0 "'Khrushchyovka' is the unofficial designation for a type of low-cost, concrete-panelled three to five-storied apartment building developed at the request of our leader Nikita Khrushchev. Mass production of these structures should finally solve the housing problem in the rapidly expanding Ukrainian cities and will provide more employment and accommodation to the masses."
UKR_Remove_Khrushchev:0 "Purge Khrushchev"
UKR_Remove_Khrushchev_desc:0 "The recent denigration of the royal position has demonstrated that Krushchev and his Popular Front partners are an unacceptable threat to King and Country. We will remove them from all of their offices in a major purge with the Hetman's backing. Once done, we will have to abolish their most radical laws and start to re-calibrate our economy."

UKR_comrade_devotion:0 "Comrade Devotion"
UKR_comrade_devotion_desc:0 "Ukraine is whole once more, the nation united in support of Khrushchev’s policies, this nation-wide strive for excellence has created an atmosphere of hard work. Across Ukraine in factories, farms, mines, ports, stores there are dedicated workers forging a new Ukraine!"
UKR_wealth_distribute:0 "Distribute Our New Wealth"
UKR_wealth_distribute_desc:0 "Profits gained from the new Kulak taxes will be distributed amongst the poorer labourers in order to decrease economic division. Providing workers with a higher income will boost popularity for Khrushchev and raise the living standards for many. Greed has polluted the nation, it is time for equality for all!"
UKR_new_society:0 "New Ukrainian Society"
UKR_new_society_desc:0 "A nation of true freedom, happiness and equality! A united proletariat represented both in the fields labouring and in the government dictating. Now we can declare the foundation of a new nation, one that is directed by socialism!"
UKR_peasant_army:0 "Revolutionary Peasants' Army"
UKR_peasant_army_desc:0 "The military of the Ukranian state was mostly composed of reactionary and nationalist commanders, when comrade Khrushchev seized power many of these generals refused to serve under a socialist republican. Therefore Khrushchev has restructured the military into a mass fighting force of proletariat, they may lack in experience whoever they are loyal comrades!"


UKR_Broad_Coalition:0 "Coalition With The Nationalists"
UKR_Broad_Coalition_desc:0 "Realising the scale of the Syndicalist threat, Hetman Skoropadskyi decided to strike a bargain with the pro-Russian 'ViN' and nationalist 'OUN'. Both parties will get freedom of action in regions where they are especially popular, but in return they will support Skoropadskyi's regime and the King in the Rada through a 'confidence and supply' agreement."
UKR_Rightist_Government:0 "Initial Administrative Reforms"
UKR_Rightist_Government_desc:0 "Members of 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian Nationalists' have begun to replace Hetman-period officials in the regions en-masse, somewhat upsetting the balance of the Rada. Surprisingly, this has had a positive effect on our economy because eager new local governments are keen to solve the problems afflicting their own towns. The first steps of reform are underway."
UKR_ViN_Russophiles:0 "Church and Nation"
UKR_ViN_Russophiles_desc:0 "It seems that Mykhailo Bulhakov, with the help of 'ViN', has finally found a method by which the land question can be resolved amicably. The Ukrainian Church, which is a part of the Russian Orthodox Church, will sell vast swathes of mostly unoccupied lands to the peasants at a discount, but Orthodoxy will be recognised as the formal state religion in Ukraine."
UKR_Abolish_Law:0 "Recognise Russian"
UKR_Abolish_Law_desc:0 "One of the biggest problems which exists in Ukraine is the language question. De-facto, the Russian language is used by a majority of the population, but its usage is prohibited by the state institutions. 'ViN' has always opposed this prohibition and thus it is with great pleasure that Mykhailo Bulhakov is now able to abolish this language law."
UKR_Prosvita_Mov:0 "The Prosvita Movement"
UKR_Prosvita_Mov_desc:0 "Unfortunately, a sizeable percentage of our population use the Russian language despite the fact that the government doesn't recognise it at a state level for use in national institutions. To combat this, 'OUN' has proposed to invest in a 'Prosvita' ('Education') movement. The aim of 'Prosvita' is to spread Ukrainian language and culture throughout the country, as well as abroad."
UKR_Free_Trade:0 "Eastern Free Trade Area"
UKR_Free_Trade_desc:0 "The free trade area with Ukraine has shown its benefits. The borderlands which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg are full of collieries and ironworks now. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest level since 1918. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
UKR_Crisis_Coalition:0 "Crisis in the Coalition"
UKR_Crisis_Coalition_desc:0 "Though the Syndicalist threat has mostly melted away due to government reforms, 'ViN' and 'OUN' have gained too much popularity among the citizens of Ukraine and their followers are inadvertently violently splitting our country apart with their nationalistic fervour. This situation cannot continue as the situation in Europe is quickly deteriorating."

UKR_Dissolve_Rada:0 "Dissolve the Rada"
UKR_Dissolve_Rada_desc:0 "Our Supreme Rada (Parliament) has always been too left and never really supported Skoropadskyi's policies as Hetman. The King has been shaken out of his legislative stupor to grant Skoropadskyi the authority to dissolve the Rada and form instead a loyal State Senate, stacked primarily with regime puppets and useful officials from different Ukrainian regions."

UKR_Snap_Elections:0 "Call Snap Elections"
UKR_Snap_Elections_desc:0 "The leader of the Rada, failing to achieve a majority government, has invoked a vote of no confidence in the current Ukrainian government. Falling to public pressure, he has decided to call for the first free and fair elections in nearly 20 years to try and boost legitimacy."
UKR_Popular_Kingdom:0 "A Popular Hetmanate"
UKR_Popular_Kingdom_desc:0 "The elections were a rousing success, and one of the popular, pro-Ukrainian parties has taken an absolute majority in the Rada. Despite this, many corrupt elements still exist in the government, and it is our responsibility to ensure those responsible are ousted from power."
UKR_Agrarian_Reform:0 "Agrarian Reform"
UKR_Agrarian_Reform_desc:0 "Now that we have a mandate from the people, it is time to take back control of our farms from the German oligarchs. The government has devised a program which provides an incentive system for existing landowners to sell their farmland to the government at above the market rate, from which smaller parcels will then be provided to Ukrainian citizens. Furthermore, we have received permission from the German government to sell our grain outside of the Mitteleuropan sphere, provided these other nations are not considered a direct threat to the Reichspakt and exports to the German sphere take priority."
UKR_Defenders_of_Democracy:0 "Defenders of Democracy"
UKR_Defenders_of_Democracy_desc:0 "The Ukrainian armed forces have always been a point of weakness in our young nation. With us sharing much of our border with the unpredictable Russian bear as well as the rising red tide across Europe, it is time to upgrade our armed forces with help from our allies in order to best defend a free Ukraine from threats abroad."
UKR_Ukrainian_Identity:0 "A Ukrainian Identity"
UKR_Ukrainian_Identity_desc:0 "While Ukraine as a state has not existed for very long, our nation has existed for hundreds of years. We must invest in education, the arts, and the Ukrainian language so that the people within our borders know what it truly means to be Ukrainian."
UKR_Enshrine_Freedoms:0 "Enshrine Basic Freedoms"
UKR_Enshrine_Freedoms_desc:0 "The Rada has passed an amendment to the Ukrainian Constitution, enshrining basic freedoms such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, and perhaps most significantly, freedom to organize into a trade union. The protections of unionization and a free press may not go over well with the Germans, but King Vasyl has publicly announced that such freedoms are necessary to prevent a syndicalist uprising."

UKR_Pereyaslav_treaty:0 "Treaty of Pereyaslav"
UKR_Pereyaslav_treaty_desc:0 "With Russian nationalists in charge of the Ukrainian government, the option is now available for us to petition the Russian government for reintegration back into Mother Russia.

UKR_OUN_Embargo:0 "Embargo Germany"
UKR_OUN_Embargo_desc:0 "With Ukrainian nationalists dominating the government, the time has come to put the Ukrainian people first - by taking a serious gamble. For too long our nation's economy and agricultural sector has been geared towards serving the Germany people at our own expense. This will end. Protectionism is the only way we can assert ourselves."
UKR_Grand_Coronation:0 "A Grand Coronation"
UKR_Grand_Coronation_desc:0 "With the Kingdom finally becoming stable once more it has been proposed that a second and grand coronation inside Saint Sophia's Cathedral be prepared. Unfortunately due to the political turmoil following Vasyl's death, [ROOT.GetSuccessorName] was unable to receive a proper coronation. This will be rectified at once."
UKR_Ban_ViN:0 "Ban ViN"
UKR_Ban_ViN_desc:0 "The so-called 'Faith and Nation' organisation is little more than a front for russophilic traitors and if they were in power they would see us annexed into the old Empire. With Dontsov assuming the mantle of government it is time to permanently rid ourselves of these treacherous scum."
UKR_Ban_OUN:0 "Ban The OUN"
UKR_Ban_OUN_desc:0 "The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists, often referred to as the OUN, has become something of a problem in recent years.

UKR_Discredit_Democrats:0 "Discredit Moderate Republicanism"
UKR_Discredit_Democrats_desc:0 "For many years the moderate republicans of Ukraine have attacked and criticised our rule for various reasons and harken back to the short-lived people's republic. Their influence must be curbed and the legacy of the UNR slandered in the minds of all Ukrainians."
UKR_State_Companies:0 "State Backed Companies"

UKR_Espouse_Democrats:0 "Espouse Democratic Values"
UKR_Espouse_Democrats_desc:0 "For many years the moderate republicans of Ukraine had attacked and criticised this country's rule for various reasons and harkened back to the short-lived people's republic. It is because of them that our transition to a full-fledged constitutional monarchy has been so successful. Their influence must be recognized and the legacy of the UNR praised in the minds of all Ukrainians."
UKR_Curb_Executive:0 "Limit The Executive Powers"
UKR_Curb_Executive_desc:0 "The executive powers have always been a bit too strong and this allowed extreme reactionaries to dominate state affairs.

UKR_Slava_Ukraini:0 "Glory to Ukraine!"
UKR_Slava_Ukraini_desc:0 "'Slava Ukraini!'- Glory to Ukraine - is the national salute of Ukraine. First heard in the brief revolution of 1917, it has since been repurposed by right and left alike as a symbol of Ukrainian unity.

UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery:0 "Begin Ukrainian Recovery"
UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery_desc:0 "Social problems always provoke political instability. Lots of peasants join Syndicalist, nationalist or Russian separatist movements because of awful living conditions.

For this, we need cash."
UKR_First_Loan:0 "German Loan For Electrification"
UKR_First_Loan_desc:0 "We should ask Germany for a loan, which we will be able to use for the electrification of the the poorest grain-growers. By doing so we will improve their living conditions and help modernise their production methods.

UKR_First_TaxHike:0 "Taxes For The Electrification"

UKR_Second_Loan_desc:0 "We have improved the situation in Central Ukraine - it's time to do something in the Eastern part of the country.

UKR_Revive_Agriculture:0 "Revive Agriculture"
UKR_Revive_Agriculture_desc:0 "Our main aim was to turn Ukraine into the breadbasket of Europe and an indispensable partner to Germany and the Reichspakt. On the contrary, we became even more dependent on German goods after Black Monday and our trade deficit widened significantly.

UKR_Donbass_Industry:0 "Rejuvenate Donbas Factories"
UKR_Donbass_Industry_desc:0 "After a long period of political turbulence, the situation in Ukraine is more or less stable, and we have a good chance to continue reforms.

We should ask France for an alliance."

 UKR_army_research_bureau_desc:0 "As we march into the future, it becomes plainly obvious that new wars will rather be won using superior technology than any long-form trench warfare or “flood-wave” tactics.

### Events ###
ukraine.1.t:0 "Our Kingdom"
ukraine.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Ukraine proclaimed its independence with German support on 25th January 1918, a state of affairs that was quickly ratified by the Peace of Nations agreement at Brest-Litovsk. An initial experiment with socialism in the form of a People's Republic was swiftly expunged by a German-backed coup. This operation, led by the strongman and former general in the Russian army Pavlo Skoropadskyi, set the tone for Ukraine's future. It was to be a breadbasket used by a military-aristocrat elite from across Eastern Europe as a source of food, a convenient market for goods and a military bulwark against the weakened Russian Republic. For a time the dispute between Germany and its Austro-Hungarian ally over Ukrainian rumbled on after the Weltkrieg, eventually settling on a compromise whereby King Vasily, an Austrian archduke born Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, would rule with the support of Skoropadskyi, who as the German-allied 'Hetman', holds incredible powers of both civil and military affairs. By 1927, German involvement in the Austrian Ausgleich negotiations meant that Ukraine fell de-facto into the hands of the Hetman, with King Vasily becoming an increasingly marginalised figure. Ukraine under the Hetmanate has become the breadbasket of the Reichspakt, and made its wealthy landowners exorbinantly wealthy, but at the expense of the Ukrainian peasantry. Now, almost twenty years after the Weltkrieg the national situation is unstable. The Reich forces us to sell our goods almost exclusively to nations within its sphere of influence while Syndicalists gain popularity amongst the downtrodden rural poor and city workers with each passing day. Both ethnic Russians and the pro-Russian population dream of unification with our former master to the East while Ukrainian nationalists proclaim that our Kingdom is no more than a German puppet. This is a immutable truth. Despite these many issues afflicting us, our land is prosperous and fertile, our people industrious and our potential boundless."
ukraine.1.a:0 "Shche Ne Vmerla Ukraina!"
ukraine.2.t:0 "The Ukrainian Government"
ukraine.2.d:0 "It is fair to say that our government is divided. While Pavlo Skoropadskyi does his best to solve the antagonism between the army, consisting of former officers of the Russian Imperial Army, and the civil administration, most of which actively supports our current position in the Reichspakt, many of Ukraine's problems can only be solved when the majority of our population - the kulaks and peasants - have an opportunity to sell their substantial agricultural produce in Europe beyond the narrow confines of the Reichspakt."
ukraine.2.a:0 "We shouldn't provoke the peasants!"
ukraine.3.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Ukraine!"
ukraine.3.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into the abyss, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now that the crash's shock waves have reached the Ukraine, German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ukrainian Hrivna is losing value, and resource exports are shrinking exponentially."
ukraine.3.a:0 "Let us hope that Europe remains open to us."
ukraine.4.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis!"
ukraine.4.d:0 "Since the Weltkrieg, Ukraine has traditionally relied upon its valuable grain trade with the German Empire in order to maintain its economic security. Unfortunately the current socio-economic issues afflicting the Reich have meant that it is now far more interested in protecting its own farmers than taking the politically unpopular move of subsidising Ukrainian agriculture. This could be very dangerous for us as without support from the German market, our ruling class of agrarian landowners could find it difficult to maintain their dominance in the countryside."
ukraine.4.a:0 "We're still the breadbasket of Europe, right?"
ukraine.5.t:0 "Faith and Nation"
ukraine.5.d:0 "Before the agricultural crisis pro-Russian movements were rather weak and disunited, ensuring they didn't pose much of a threat to our government. This crisis has led to a shocking rise in popular support for these organisations and an increase in their willingness to cooperate. Yesterday a famous Russian writer from Kiev, Mykhailo Bulhakov, proclaimed the unification of the three largest movements into a singular organisation known as 'Faith and Nation' ('Vera i Narod') or just 'ViN'. Supported by the Ukrainian Church, itself heavily influenced by the Moscow Patriarchate, the population of Southern and Eastern Ukraine and many high-ranking officers, this movement could provoke serious instability in some parts of our country."
ukraine.5.a:0 "We really must protest!"

ukraine.7.t:0 "Dmitri Dontsov Deported From Galicia-Lodomeria"
ukraine.7.d:0 "Dmitri Dontsov, an renowned ideologue of Ukrainian nationalism, has been deported from Galicia, where he had urged the local Ukrainian minority to resist the Austro-Hungarian administration. He now claims that our silence on the crisis has exposed the weakness of our government, and that's why Ukraine should be ruled by 'real Ukrainian patriots'. His slogan 'Ukraine for the Ukrainians' is attractive to many citizens, especially in Western Ukraine, and graffiti has been spotted in a number of towns. This could be dangerous for the cabinet, since we've already lost considerable support in the East."
ukraine.7.a:0 "Welcome home I suppose..."
ukraine.8.t:0 "Khrushchev criticises the Ukrainian government."
ukraine.8.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev, a prominent Ukrainian social democrat, has opened the 3rd Congress of the Ukrainian Syndicalist Party. He demands that the government takes extreme measures to defend the workers and peasants from poverty brought on by the global crash. To further this agenda he has proposed a new programme of major social and economic reforms aimed at helping Ukraine overcome the crisis. The controversial figure is going to present his plan in the Rada soon."
ukraine.8.a:0 "Extreme measures? This stinks of Bolshevikism!"
ukraine.9.t:0 "Our Future"
ukraine.9.d:0 "The agricultural crisis has almost shattered the Ukrainian economy and the stability of many of the nation's most important institutions. The King's grip on the country is weakening by the hour, peasants loyal to the Hetman want major land reform, pro-Russian malcontents and Ukrainian nationalists demand radical measures and the Syndicalists are mobilising workers all over the country. Various political movements struggle for power in our teetering nation, and soon we have to choose who will lead Ukraine into the future."
ukraine.9.a:0 "Ukraine will stagger on as it always has!"
ukraine.10.t:0 "Khrushchev's Speech"
ukraine.10.d:0 "As one of the few social democrats in the Rada, Nikita Khrushchev wields an mesmerising degree of influence over the Ukrainian peasantry and urban rabble. He has taken advantage of our troubles in a recent speech, where he has openly called for sweeping land reforms, an extension of the electoral franchise and an end to landlord dominance in the countryside. These demands are extremely popular among the lower classes, and are giving them ideas dangerous to national stability. Despite this, perhaps we could make use of Khrushchev's popularity and allow him to become the face of economic reforms unpopular amongst the rural landlords that we would otherwise take a political hit over anyway."
ukraine.10.a:0 "Dismiss Skoropadskyi and invite Khrushchev to head a popular government."
ukraine.11.t:0 "The Language Issue"
ukraine.11.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev has joined the government as leader during one of the darkest periods in our nation's history since 1918. However, before solving the economic problems it is imperative that Khrushchev respond to the burgeoning pro-Russian movement, which has had a malign impact on our electorate in industrial Ukraine. One method that could help neutralise their popularity is by addressing the language question, a domestic dilemma that has been lingering for years. The Russian language is used de-facto by a substantial percentage of the population, however its usage is expressly prohibited in state institutions. This has given rise to accusations that Russians are treated as second-class citizens."
ukraine.11.a:0 "Make Russian the second official state language."
ukraine.11.b:0 "Arrest important pro-Russian leaders."
ukraine.12.t:0 "National-Syndicalists Protest!"
ukraine.12.d:0 "Notable Ukrainian National-Syndicalists Vlas Chubar and Alexander Shumskyi oppose Khrushchev's decision to allow the usage of the Russian language in administrative institutions. They claim that this measure won't help to unify our country and that unopposed usage of the Russian language will lead to the growth of the separatist organisations in Southern and Eastern Ukrainian."
ukraine.12.a:0 "Millions of our workers don't think so."
ukraine.12.b:0 "All right, all right. Restore the status quo."
ukraine.13.t:0 "Pro-Russian Leaders Stir Up Trouble"
ukraine.13.d:0 "Leaders of the different pro-Russian movements have unfortunately managed to escape Ukrainian soil before they could be arrested. Many have sought temporary exile in Romania and Russia, with both nations somewhat hostile to our pro-German regime and aware of the Kaiser's gaze turning west. Mykhailo Bulhakov has announced publicly that the nationalist umbrella organisation 'Faith and Nation' is ready to fight for the rights of Russians in Ukraine. Maybe we have made a big mistake."
ukraine.13.a:0 "Another problem!"
ukraine.14.t:0 "Profits From Increased Taxation on the Kulaks"
ukraine.14.d:0 "Our decision to raise taxes on the Kulak landlords and spend this money on the poorest peasants has helped to stabilise our agriculture sector. 60-70% of the state and private farms are estimated to now be entirely self-supporting. As a result of our increased support from the villages and farms we can turn to other pressing issues with our faltering economy."
ukraine.14.a:0 "That's one fire extinguished."
ukraine.15.t:0 "Another Crisis!"
ukraine.15.d:0 "Our government's decision to divide the property of the Kulaks has led to a second crisis among the farmers. Our collectivisation attempts have ended in a total failure, with agricultural yields from the new collectivised farms cumulatively less than the smallholdings that they replaced. Unbelievably the situation in Ukraine has managed to deteriorate even further!"
ukraine.15.a:0 "Proof that Syndicalism doesn't always work."
ukraine.16.t:0 "The Fate of the Ukrainian Monarchy"
ukraine.16.d:0 "His Majesty King Vasily I Vyshyvaniy gave Nikita Khrushchev extensive powers in a bid to control the revolutionary trends sweeping the country in the aftermath of the crisis. Now that Khrushchev's initial programme has been implemented successfully, many interest groups within Ukraine have begun debating the continued prominence of the monarchy considering its relative powerlessness in the face of recent crises."
ukraine.16.a:0 "The bourgeoisie like liberty, but would prefer a less radical government."
ukraine.16.b:0 "The poor love Khrushchev, but hate the King! Long live the Republic!"
ukraine.16.c:0 "The King shall invite Volodymyr Chekhivskyi to save the people and the kingdom."
ukraine.17.t:0 "A New Minister of Security?"
ukraine.17.d:0 "Igor Kistyakovskyi has been our minister of Security since 1918 but recently had to retire from his post because of his poor health. 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian Nationalists' have immediately started fighting for this position because each party hopes to increase their influence over Ukrainian internal policy. We have to give 'ViN' or 'OUN' this post, according to the power-sharing agreement concluded before the elections."
ukraine.17.a:0 "Vladimir Khitrovo from 'ViN'"
ukraine.17.b:0 "Vladimir Chekhovskyi from 'OUN'"
ukraine.17.c:0 "Daniil Skoropadskyi, son of our Hetman."
ukraine.18.t:0 "Free Trade Area With the Ukraine"
ukraine.18.d:0 "The new Ukrainian government has sought to reconstruct the economy by establishing a free trade area between the Ukraine and the Russian market. This virtual erasure of eye-watering tarrifs and customs duties at the border would be a substantial boon for our own merchants and industrialists. Furthermore, opening up the largely agrarian Ukrainian market to Russian importers desperate to feed the austerity-hit masses in Russia's major cities would massively boost our economy..."
ukraine.18.a:0 "Launch this project!"
ukraine.19.t:0 "Free Trade Area Results in Profits"
ukraine.19.d:0 "The free trade area with Ukraine has shown its benefits. The borderlands, which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg, are now home to a number of new collieries and ironworks and our urban poor now have access to cheap Ukrainian grain to supplement their diet. The unemployment rate has been reduced substantially in certain key sectors. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
ukraine.19.a:0 "Great."
ukraine.20.t:0 "Free Trade Area Results in Profits"
ukraine.20.d:0 "The free trade area with Russia has shown its benefits. The borderlands, which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg, are now home to a number of new collieries and ironworks and our grain, previously rotting in the fields, now has access to a massive market in the form of the Russian urban poor. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest level since 1918. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"

A number of young people are ready to defend their country, culture and traditions. They will be perfect recruits for our armed forces."
ukraine.21.a:0 "That's right young men, enrol in the army!"
ukraine.22.t:0 "Regional Languages"
ukraine.22.d:0 "Though Skoropadskyi refused to recognise the Russian language as a second state language, he allowed the Ukrainian regions to choose which languages could be officially recognised. Now that the majority of our regions have recognised the Russian language, Skoropadskyi has finally conceded to give it the same position in a national scale."
ukraine.22.a:0 "'Yazyk' and 'Mova' should have a common future in Ukraine!"
ukraine.23.t:0 "Ukraine Request Recovery Aid"
ukraine.23.d:0 "The Ukrainian government has asked us for a relatively substantial loan, which they wish to use for the electrification of the poorest grain-growers. One of our major Reichspakt allies and the bastion of our Ostwall against a Russian resurgence, Ukraine's situation is already incredibly unstable, in part due to our protectionist measures during Black Week that proved detrimental to Ukrainian agriculture."
ukraine.23.a:0 "Very well. Grant them the money."
ukraine.23.b:0 "Who cares about Ukraine?"
ukraine.24.t:0 "Germany Grants Us a Loan!"
ukraine.24.d:0 "The German Empire has accepted our request! Now we can invest this money into the electrification of the villages in Central Ukraine, which promises to increase our support amongst the peasantry, boost our agricultural productivity and improve our rural economy. Germany's decision is perhaps not surprising. Ukraine is, after all, a much better place to invest in than Poland!"
ukraine.24.a:0 "Germany is truly our friend and protector!"
ukraine.25.t:0 "The Electrification is Complete!"
ukraine.25.d:0 "With the aid of loans from the German government, our government has finally been able to electrify virtually all of the villages in Central Ukraine, greatly improving the agricultural yields of our peasant farms. As a result of this and our previous measures Ukraine has finally begun to recover from the crushing effects of Black Monday."
ukraine.25.a:0 "Great!"
ukraine.26.t:0 "Germany Has Declined to Grant Us a Loan!"
ukraine.26.d:0 "The German Empire is not going to help us with investment. We must either increase our taxes or abandon this plan."

ukraine.27.t:0 "The Electrification is Complete!"
ukraine.27.d:0 "Even though Germany refused to grant us loans, our government has finally been able to electrify virtually all of the villages in Central Ukraine through increased taxation, greatly improving the agricultural yields of our peasant farms.

ukraine.27.a:0 "It was worth it."
ukraine.28.t:0 "Another Ukrainian Loan"
ukraine.28.d:0 "The Ukrainian government asked us for a loan again, which they want to use for the industrialisation of the Eastern part of the Ukraine to quell Syndicalist power there. However, the size of this loan is much bigger than the one before. Many senior personnel in our administration believe that the rise of Syndicalism in Ukraine is a direct threat to Reichspakt solidarity."
ukraine.28.a:0 "Very well, give them the money."
ukraine.28.b:0 "There is a crisis in Germany, you know."
ukraine.29.t:0 "Germany Granted Us Another Loan"
ukraine.29.d:0 "The German Empire has accepted our request for further capital! Now we can invest this money into the industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine. It should help us to defeat the burgeoning Syndicalist movement there."
ukraine.29.a:0 "Very well."
ukraine.30.t:0 "Industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine"
ukraine.30.d:0 "Many workers in Eastern Ukraine have gotten new jobs in emerging industries due to our investment there, funded by the loan from Germany. As a result our loyalty amongst the urban poor has grown immensely, greatly neutering the power of the Syndicalist movement there. We have recovered from Black Monday, while also crippling the power base of the trade unions!"
ukraine.30.a:0 "Two birds with one stone. Fantastic!"
ukraine.31.t:0 "Germany Refused A Second Loan!"
ukraine.31.d:0 "The Germany Empire is not going to help us with investment in our industrial East, shortsightedly forgetting that the more power Syndicalism gains in Eastern Europe, the greater the threat to their interests. We must choose whether to increase our taxes or abandon this plan entirely."
ukraine.31.a:0 "Time to raise taxes."
ukraine.31.b:0 "It's too damn expensive!"
ukraine.32.t:0 "The Industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine"
ukraine.32.d:0 "Many workers in Eastern Ukraine have gotten new jobs in emerging industries due to our investment there, funded by extra taxes levied on the population.

ukraine.33.d:0 "Ukraine, a new Syndicalist nation in Eastern Europe led by Nikita Khrushchev, has requested our support. They cannot start the reform of their industry alone and they have turned to friendly nations overseas for help. There are some plans that have been proposed by our economy minister - the question is which one should we choose?"
ukraine.33.a:0 "Time to help their military industry!"

ukraine.33.c:0 "They can do everything without us."
ukraine.34.t:0 "Syndicalist Ukraine Leaves the Reichspakt"
ukraine.34.d:0 "The treacherous Ukrainians have deserted the Reichspakt, jeopardising the sphere of influence in Eastern European that we have spent twenty years carefully constructing. Many hotheads in the general staff have suggesed direct military action to punish the new Syndicalist government and deter other potential insurrectionists. Doing so could be extremely unwise however as Ukraine possesses one of the largest armed forces in Europe and they are critical for our long-term plans as a bulwark against a belligerent Russia. Members of the Abwehr have instead suggested that we ought to use our ties with many senior Ukrainian army officials to instigate a reactionary coup d'etat in Kiev. The choice now is how we should react to this clear betrayal."
ukraine.34.a:0 "We do not have the resources to respond."
ukraine.34.b:0 "Covert operations should be resolve this."

ukraine.35.t:0 "German Military Mission Leaves the Ukraine"
ukraine.35.d:0 "Following our decision to leave the hated the Reichspakt bloc, the German military mission present in our country since 1918 has finally left! Already, officers and advisers that had been stationed on the Ostwall, in Sevastopol and the capital Kiev, have been surreptitiously evacuated over the course of the day. This is truly a testament to an independent Ukraine."
ukraine.35.a:0 "The chains are broken, for now at least."
ukraine.36.t:0 "'Arsenal'"
ukraine.36.d:0 "On January 29, 1918, the workers of the factory 'Arsenal' in Kiev organised an armed pro-Bolshevik mutiny known as a January Rebellion against the Central Rada, the Ukrainian assembly that declared the independence of Ukraine during the Russian Civil War. Since then, the government has failed to interfere with the poor administration of the factory, fearing their actions accidentally sparking a worker's revolt in Kiev. After the triumph of Syndicalism in Ukraine however, the French Commune has decided to help us with the revival of the factory. 'Arsenal' will mainly produce artillery, anti-tank, and anti-aircraft guns, all of which our nation, surrounded by forces hostile to our revolutionary ideology, desperately need."
ukraine.36.a:0 "God bless the French."
ukraine.37.t:0 "Ukraine Requests To Join The Internationale"
ukraine.37.d:0 "The government of the Ukraine have recently announced their intention of joining the Syndicalist bloc in the face of German reactionism in Eastern Europe. Unlike the vast majority of Internationale members Ukraine's Syndicalist government stems not from revolutionary activity, but working with monarchists and German stooges in government - making them most unorthodox. Still, Ukrainian peasants would be useful in the crusade against the bloodthirsty Germans and Canadian pigs."
ukraine.37.a:0 "Together we shall envelop the hated Bosche!"
ukraine.37.b:0 "Their chain-breaking credentials are... unworthy."
ukraine.38.t:0 "We Join the International"
ukraine.38.d:0 "The International is happy to see us joining the common cause, namely, destroying the evil imperialists. Now we are in the Syndicalist bloc we are part of a united struggle that stretches from Luhanks to London. Only together can we survive in the face of reactionary terror."
ukraine.38.a:0 "We will defend our liberty and independence!"
ukraine.39.t:0 "Attempt at a Military Coup"
ukraine.39.d:0 "German agitators, with the help of reactionary officers and a part of our armed forces, have launched a coup against our government and are trying to restore the pro-German regime in Ukraine. Elements of the Military Mission that had previously been deployed in key garrisons on the Ostwall, in Sevastopol port and in the capital joined forces with pro-German troops and have started running street battles near the ministry buildings. The country is in absolute chaos and liable to deteriorate further, with the survival of Syndicalism in Ukraine on a knife-edge. How will the situation develop?"
ukraine.39.a:0 "The reactionary putschists secure Kiev!"
ukraine.39.b:0 "The Red militias successfully defend Kiev!"
ukraine.40.t:0 "Reactionary Coup in the Ukraine Succeeds"
ukraine.40.d:0 "Members of the German Military Mission together, with reactionary members of the Ukrainian armed forces, have successfully seized control of Kiev, overthrowing the Syndicalist government and replacing it with one again loyal to the German Empire. After a number of street battles and open warfare raging in government buildings, the putschists began purging Reds wherever they could find them. A nervous King Vasily was given sweeping powers by a pliant Rada and again signed Ukraine up as a formal member of the Reichspakt. We have successfully prevented the poison of Syndicalism from spreading any further in Eastern Europe, and for this the Abwehr should be commended."
ukraine.40.a:0 "Excellent!"
ukraine.41.t:0 "Military Coup in the Ukraine Failed"

The French government has proposed an excellent idea that aligns with his thinking. The Commune has offered to invest in the largest nationalised brewing facility in Europe, allowing us to greatly expand it and lower the price of cheap alcohol. The expansion of the factory, named 'Obolon', will definitely give us increased support among the low and middle classes of the Ukrainian society. After all, who doesn't like alcohol?"

The nephew of Vasily, Leo Stefan Habsburg and Daniil Skoropadskyi, son of our Hetman, are both contenders for the throne. 'ViN' and 'OUN' support Daniil as they believe he will weaken Ukrainian dependence on the Reichspakt by virtue of his lack of royal ties with the European dynasties. Leo, despite his dynastic ties, only has support from Skoropadskyi's opponents and employers, many of whom have serious connections with Germany and Austria. The question now is which is preferable.

Indeed, many in our nationalist government have postulated that this state of affairs is an intentional part of the Reich's plans to castrate us and turn us into little more than a pathetic puppet, hopelessly reliant on them. On account of our dependency, our farmers aren't able to develop their own businesses and compete with well-funded German freeholders, many of whom hold key positions in our economy.

The film, which was conceived to be an answer to the Bulhakov's 'White Guard' doesn't try to point out possible methods of reconciliation, but raises by implication the potential for separatists and spies of foreign powers to still be hiding among the Ukrainian population and both willing and able to try to exploit its weakness."

Despite the conflicting views held by the factions they remain a united force primarily thanks to Khrushchev, whose cult like following amongst the peasantry has allowed himself and his allies to coerce the moderates into remaining loyal. For now Khrushchev has held back on previous radical promises such as the abolishment of the monarchy in order to appease the social democratic majority who wish for progressive change, his increasingly vague stances have helped maintain the Front’s unity whilst not completely rejecting the will of his hardcore supporters.

Thanks to Comrade Khruschev the Ukranian state is rapidly industrialising and modernising.

After the shocking death of the king who brought democracy to our nation, Syndicalists have been rounded up and banned from government in an effort to prevent those responsible from taking control in the next election. Meanwhile, the Nationalists have more or less become a fringe party and early polls are showing they will likely not reach the threshold to be on the ballot in the next election. Furthermore, reports coming out of Ukrainian newspapers discovered a plot by Pavlo Skoropadskyi to undermine Ukrainian democracy by dissolving the Rada had they received a majority in the previous election and as such have been banned from future elections."

Protests have been mounting in Kyiv in recent days to implement moderate reforms based on the model of Western democracies such as those found in Scandinavia, stopping short of a total governmental overhaul but instead calling for open elections to solve the deadlock in the Rada. While a minority of these protesters are ardent republicans, many seem open to the idea of retaining Vasyl as a constitutional monarch. One of Ukraine's most prominent generals, Symon Petliura, has expressed their support for the protests, saying that allowing free elections to the Rada could go a long way to bridge the gap between left and right, and perhaps even solve the ongoing agricultural crisis."

monsocukr.1.t:0 "A Bloody Red Morning"
monsocukr.1.d:0 "This morning at 8 sharp, King Vasyl I was shot and killed during his daily morning walk. Long preferring to walk alone without his usual accompaniment of guards, the fact something like this did not happen early is a bit shocking. The assassin, apprehended as soon as the shots were heard, was a member of the banned Communist Party of Ukraine, led by one Nikita Khrushchev, long an opponent of our regime. Despite this, the King's death could not come at a more opportune time. Although supportive of our reforms, the King had yet to fully embrace the rebirth of the revolution. With his death, Leo Stefan von Habsburg, not yet even a teenager, has been chosen by our government to replace the late King. Due to him still having years before he can fully take on his responsibilities, Leo Stefan, now King Lev II, is a perfect match, as he can be shown the truths of our ideals and policies. The Kingdom may mourn the death of her late King, but with his death comes a new dawn for the nation, under the dual rule of the Monarchy and the People's Government."

Charged with conspiracy to assassinate the late King, the trial is a forgone conclusion. While all will get a chance to speak, present evidence and defend themselves, all know that  the Khrushchevites are doomed to swing.\n\nThe trial itself was a simple affair, and hearkened back to the various show trials that the Bolsheviks carried out in the final days of the Soviet uprising.  Each and every man was convicted of treason, with the rope waiting for Khrushchev and others. What's more, the KMS has been formally banned, it's assets seized and turned over to the People's Government. While this was a small step, it is a necessary one, for to truly revitalize the nation, the rot must be purged out."

monsocukr.3.d:0 "Of all the various political factions we find ourselves competing against within Ukraine, the National-Syndicalists, under the control of Oleksander Shumskyi, are the closest to us in terms of policy. Wishing to build a syndicalist state within a revived Ukraine is the gist of the their policy, and the similarities between our own program is quite striking. Seeing as how we both find ourselves adrift in a sea of hostile ideologies, it has been agreed that both of our parties should merge, allowing us to implement our programs all the easier. Mykhailo Yalovy, our foreign minister, is a personal friend of Shumskyi, thus making the merger all the easier.\n\nThis merger is, of course, not just for convenience, it also allows us to keep a closer eye on Shumskyi, as he is seen as a threat to our rule. Regardless, with the merger of our two parties, the future of Ukraine looks ever the brighter."

This has not been helped by period of Russifaction and other such attempts to strip our nation of it's uniqueness. This shall stand no longer! Under the people's government, our culture will thrive. Be it promotion of events featuring famous works of art, state sponsored food expos, or funding the arts in general, we shall not rest until Ukraine's culture is revived! While this may draw the ire of Russiphiles in the East and the Poles in the west, we know our cause is just.

Be it the subjaction of our people, the attempts to force us to become Russians or even the near-destruction of our culture, we have suffered more at the hands of the Russians then anyone else. No Longer! With a government that truly cares for the people finally in power within Ukraine, we shall reverse the table. Those Russians foolish enough to our lands shall be forced out, and driven back to 'Mother Russia.' Our Eastern lands shall be purified, and the same horror they inflicted on us will be inflicted upon them. When the time finally comes for us to stand against the Bear, we shall hold the line, for we know that a truly free Ukraine, by the People for the People, lives and dies with us!"

monsocukr.6.t:0 "To Arms for Ukraine!"
monsocukr.6.d:0 "In the history of our great nation, figures such as Vladimir the Great stand out as true heros to the national cause, These figures are known to every true son of Ukraine, and their model still serves as perfect examples for our armed forces. Bohdan Khmelnytskyi is one such man. Fighting against the oppressive rule of the Poles, Khmelnytskyi's might established a free nation that we are the inheritors of such. In emulation of his legacy, and the government's own promotion of men such like him, various militias of peasants have formed, and have begun attacking and seizing land from Polish nobles that inhabit the west of our country. While these raids have been fairly tame, it cannot be said they don't show what a rallied up people can do. Within the sized lands, the former palaces of the landowning Poles have been transformed into massive schools, greatly increasing education within our rural population. What's more, the land sized has actually been handed over to government control by the people, giving us the chance to see it divided up correctly. With more raids planned or ongoing, it seems the people have finally found an outlet for years of oppression."
monsocukr.6.a:0 "A victory for the masses!"

monsocukr.7.t:0 "Terrorist Activity in Bessarabia!"
monsocukr.7.d:0 "Bessarabia has long been one of most contested areas of land, claimed  by both the Russians and Ukrainians, thus it is no surprise that both have hungrily eyed the land since the end of the Weltkrieg. While both have waited for a moment of weakness, waiting for us to slip up so they could size Bessarabia out from under us. It seems however, that this period of relative peace has ended. Over the course of the past few days, a string of terror attacks, carried out by what appears to be a contingent of Cossacks fighting what they claim is a 'modern day Yasir for the Ukrainian population in Bessarabia.'\n\nWhile we have no evidence besides hearsay, it is believed these Cossacks are agents of the 'Monarcho-Socialist' government in Kiev. Seemingly confirming this, Kiev has offered to subdue these terrorists, in exchange for 'temporary authority' over Bessarabia. In other words, they are demanding we hand over Bessarabia or the attacks will continue, if not all out war between our two nations. While such a war would no doubt be easily won, many within our government are calling for us to cave to Ukraine and to focus on reclaiming the rest of Greater Romania, saying we can always get the land back later. Whatever our choice, we must do something quickly, before even more lives are lost. "
monsocukr.7.a:0 "It will take more then terrorists for us to hand over our land!"
monsocukr.7.b:0 "Enough! The Ukrainians can have the land, it's not worth the human toll."

monsocukr.8.t:0 "Failure of Operation Muromets"
monsocukr.8.d:0 "Despite our best attempts, our convert efforts to get Romanian to hand over Bessarabia peacefully, also known as Operation Muromets, has failed. Despite having no direct evidence to link our government to the various terrorist attacks and cells that formed as a result of our actions, the Romanian government clearly seems to know it was us, and has issued a stern 'warning' that any attempts to restore order within Bessarabia by our troops would be seen as an act of war. While the Operation was clearly a failure, that doesn't mean we can't capitalize on the chaos that reigns in Bessarabia to quickly seize it from Romania will a small war. Regardless, the operation was a failure, and the only remaining avenue to capture the land is by war, if that war comes sooner or later remains to be seen however."
monsocukr.8.a:0 "Death to Romania! We march for Greater Ukraine!"
monsocukr.8.b:0 "They've won this round, we'll be back..."

monsocukr.9.t:0 "An Offer from the South"
monsocukr.9.d:0 "Much like ourselves, the government of Ukraine has recently taken a great leap forward, emerging as a predominant People's Government under the watchful eye of their King. Just like us, they have fallen adrift in a sea of conflicting ideologies and movements, however unlike when we first took up the mantle of the King and the People, a grouping of like minded nations exists, that of course being us and our Union of People's Crowns. Seeking to latch onto a nation that shares ideals, the Ukrainian Government has formally petitioned to join the Union of People's Crowns. Promising access to their vast grain resources, the Ukrainian delegation has promised that there is nothing to lose by granting them membership in the Union. Despite this, many wonder if they have alternative motives in this request, thus bringing their motivation for  joining into question."
monsocukr.9.a:0 "Of course! Long live the People's Crowns!"
monsocukr.9.b:0 "What has Ukraine ever done for us? Rejected!"

monsocukr.10.t:0 "A Disappointing Response"
monsocukr.10.d:0 "Much to our disappointment, the People's Government of White Ruthenia has denined our request to join the Union of People's Crowns. While unexpected, this is expected to have little effect on the nation overall. Despite this, we once again find ourselves alone, with our backs to the wall. May God protect the Union, for we cannot."
monsocukr.10.a:0 "A setback for sure, but one we can recover from."

monsocukr.11.t:0 "The East Ablaze" 
monsocukr.11.d:0 "As predicted, the Russians and Russophiles who inhabit the east of our nation have not taken kindly to our efforts to remove their perfidious influence. What started as a series of spontaneous protests against our anti-russian policies has turned into riots, and in the worst case, all out insurgency. While this violence has no chance of succeeding in anything more then property damage,  it is a sign of just how deep the Bear was able to sink it's claws into our nation. The armed forces are already preparing a plan to pacify the East; Those who rebel will be given two choices, return home and accept the righteous of the King and the People's Government, or be driven to Russia, where they can finally be united with the 'Motherland'. Those who resist even this most generous offer will face our full wrath, knowing what it means to face the People's justice. Either way, by the time we are done, Ukraine shall finally be free of the Russian Bear, after so long a time."
