###Bio###
POLITICS_VASYL_DESC: "King Vasyl I von Habsburg-Lothringen is regarded by most ethnic Slavs, Russians and Ukrainians alike, to be a humiliating symbol of foreign dominance. In fact, with political polarisation growing so rapidly in Ukraine, a disdain for King Vasyl is perhaps the only commonality amongst Ukrainians. With such opposition, a stagnant economy, a dysfunctional bureaucracy, and most of all, tension with the influential Hetman, Vasyl struggles to maintain authority."
POLITICS_NIKITA_KRUSCHEV_DESC: "Nikita Kruschev, authoritarian socialist, has become the premier of Ukraine. Kruschev, born to Russian peasants near the current Russian-Ukrainian border, harbours a deep disdain for the landowning Kulaks; he plans to eliminate the Kulaks as a social class through forced seizure and collectivisation of their land. Such measures, however, are unpopular among all but a small number of Ukrainians, which may force Kruschev to compromise."
POLITICS_LEO_STEFAN_DESC: "King Leo Stefan von Habsburg-Lothringen, while ethnically Austrian, has been raised in the Ukrainian culture. While to some, Leo's ascension is indicative of compromise between the Reichspakt and Ukraine, many lament the continued dominance of Ukraine by foreigners. The real compromise, these dissidents claim, was between Germany and Austria, who are now united in support for Leo. Domestically much of Leo's support comes from the powerful land-owning class who now control the Rada and who see the young king as little more than a puppet to illicit Austro-German support for their endeavours."
POLITICS_LEV_II_DESC: "Count Leo Stefan was born to the Habsburg-Lorraine family on June 12, 1928. Being groomed to potentially succeed to the throne of a Eastern European state, Leo ended up gaining a lot of knowledge and respect for Ukrainian customs. Eventually he would be raised to this position as Lev II once King Vasyl was killed by a communist, he now tries his best to represent Ukraine. This knowledge and actual attempt to help Ukraine was noticed by some socialists who wished to keep the stability of the crown yet bring forth leftist ideals. Being entangled within these ideals, Lev the II now reigns Ukraine as the People’s King, representing and supporting their struggles against those that would keep the peasantry, and wider Ukraine down."
POLITICS_DANIIL_I_DESC: "King Daniil Skoropadsky, son of the famous 'Hetman', has ascended to the Ukrainian throne. With the long power-struggle between the Hetman and the monarchy finally resolved, Ukraine breathes a sign of relief. Daniil however is quite rightly seen by many as little more than a puppet king, effectively allowing his father to the bulk of rulership while he himself acts as the front-man. Perhaps after Pavlo Skoropadsky's death will the young king finally be able to assert himself but for now the young king will do just as he is told."
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_VYNNYCHENKO_DESC: ""
POLITICS_BORIS_MARTOS_DESC: ""
POLITICS_DMITRI_DOROSHENKO_DESC: ""
POLITICS_MIKHAIL_BULGAKOV_DESC: "Mikhail Bulgakov, an ethnic Russian born in the Kiev governate, was for much of his life known more so for his prolific writings and literary talents rather than politics. After finding himself heading up the russophile ViN organisation, he is now in charge of the government and has made his intentions clear that the so-called 'Free State of Ukraine' is little more than a temporary fixture until the nation can be annexed into the motherland once more."
POLITICS_DMITRI_DONTSOV_DESC: "Dmytro Dontsov has been are the forefront of Ukrainian nationalism for many years and has solidified his position as the primary nationalist ideologue in Ukraine. His organisation, the OUN has become powerful during the interwar and now finally ascended to a position of leadership with his intentions of driving out both German and Russian influences as well as a general crackdown against socialist activity."

### Ideas ###
language_issue: "Issue of the Russian language"
language_issue_desc: "The centuries-long Russian dominance of Ukraine and suppression of the Ukrainian language has produced a sizeable Russian-speaking minority, or perhaps even majority, in Ukraine. With independence, the Ukrainian language has been reinvigorated, much to the chagrin of numerous Russo-Ukrainians, many of whom resist the Ukrainian government or even desire a return to Russian rule."
Hetman_army: "Hetman's Army"
Hetman_army_desc: "The Hetman of Ukraine, general Pavlo Skoropadsky, supported by Germany, undermined Austrian influence in Ukraine following the 1927 Austrian Ausgleich renegotiations. The political strife between the military, dominated by the Hetman, and the Ukrainian Rada, headed by the king, has left Ukraine's military in such disarray that even personal reconciliation between the Hetman and Rada would seem to be insufficient; the Ukrainian military is in dire need of reform."

### Events ###
ukraine.1.t: "Our Kingdom"
ukraine.1.d: "The Kingdom of Ukraine proclaimed its independence with German support on 25th January 1918, a state of affairs that was quickly ratified by the Peace of Nations agreement at Brest-Litovsk. An initial experiment with socialism in the form of a People's Republic was swiftly expunged by a German-backed coup. This operation, led by the strongman and former general in the Russian army Pavlo Skoropadsky, set the tone for Ukraine's future. It was to be a breadbasket used by a military-aristocrat elite from across Eastern Europe as a source of food, a convenient market for goods and a military bulwark against the weakened Russian Republic. For a time the dispute between Germany and its Austro-Hungarian ally over Ukrainian rumbled on after the Weltkrieg, eventually settling on a compromise whereby King Vasily, an Austrian archduke born Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, would rule with the support of Skoropadsky, who as the German-allied 'Hetman', holds incredible powers of both civil and military affairs. By 1927, German involvement in the Austrian Ausgleich negotiations meant that Ukraine fell de-facto into the hands of the Hetman, with King Vasily becoming an increasingly marginalised figure. Ukraine under the Hetmanate has become the breadbasket of the Reichspakt, and made its wealthy landowners exorbinantly wealthy, but at the expense of the Ukrainian peasantry. Now, almost twenty years after the Weltkrieg the national situation is unstable. The Reich forces us to sell our goods almost exclusively to nations within its sphere of influence while Syndicalists gain popularity amongst the downtrodden rural poor and city workers with each passing day. Both ethnic Russians and the pro-Russian population dream of unification with our former master to the East while Ukrainian nationalists proclaim that our Kingdom is no more than a German puppet. This is a immutable truth. Despite these many issues afflicting us, our land is prosperous and fertile, our people industrious and our potential boundless."
ukraine.1.a: "Shche Ne Vmerla Ukraina!"
ukraine.2.t: "The Ukrainian Government"
ukraine.2.d: "It is fair to say that our government is divided. While Pavel Skoropadsky does his best to solve the antagonism between the army, consisting of former officers of the Russian Imperial Army, and the civil administration, most of which actively supports our current position in the Reichspakt, many of Ukraine's problems can only be solved when the majority of our population - the kulaks and peasants - have an opportunity to sell their substantial agricultural produce in Europe beyond the narrow confines of the Reichspakt."
ukraine.2.a: "We shouldn't provoke the peasants!"
ukraine.3.t: "Black Monday Hits Ukraine!"
ukraine.3.d: "Almost two weeks ago the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into the abyss, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now that the crash's shock waves have reached the Ukraine, German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ukrainian Hrivna is losing value, and resource exports are shrinking exponentially."
ukraine.3.a: "Let us hope that Europe remains open to us."
ukraine.4.t: "Agricultural Crisis!"
ukraine.4.d: "Since the Weltkrieg, Ukraine has traditionally relied upon its valuable grain trade with the German Empire in order to maintain its economic security. Unfortunately the current socio-economic issues afflicting the Reich have meant that it is now far more interested in protecting its own farmers than taking the politically unpopular move of subsidising Ukrainian agriculture. This could be very dangerous for us as without support from the German market, our ruling class of agrarian landowners could find it difficult to maintain their dominance in the countryside."
ukraine.4.a: "We're still the breadbasket of Europe, right?"
ukraine.5.t: "Faith and Nation"
ukraine.5.d: "Before the agricultural crisis pro-Russian movements were rather weak and disunited, ensuring they didn't pose much of a threat to our government. This crisis has led to a shocking rise in popular support for these organisations and an increase in their willingness to cooperate. Yesterday a famous Russian writer from Kiev, Mikhail Bulgakov, proclaimed the unification of the three largest movements into a singular organisation known as 'Faith and Nation' ('Vera i Narod') or just 'ViN'. Supported by the Ukrainian Church, itself heavily influenced by the Moscow Patriarchate, the population of Southern and Eastern Ukraine and many high-ranking officers, this movement could provoke serious instability in some parts of our country."
ukraine.5.a: "We really must protest!"
ukraine.6.t: "Ivan Chernyakhovsky returns from Africa"
ukraine.6.d: "Ivan Chernyakhovsky, a young and talented officer, has returned to Ukraine. He was a member of the voluntary Ukrainian division, which supported our German allies in regional conflicts in the Mittelafrikan bush. His books 'On the Banks of the Congo' and 'Safari' previously made him the most popular Ukrainian soldier and writer in the entire country. Chernyakhovsky has been promoted to the rank of Colonel and will soon become the commander of the 1st Cossack Division ('Serdyutskaya'), which ensures this popular figure will command an elite branch of the Ukrainian army."
ukraine.6.a: "Welcome home Ivan!"
ukraine.7.t: "Dmitri Dontsov Deported From Galicia-Lodomeria"
ukraine.7.d: "Dmitri Dontsov, an renowned ideologue of Ukrainian nationalism, has been deported from Galicia, where he had urged the local Ukrainian minority to resist the Austro-Hungarian administration. He now claims that our silence on the crisis has exposed the weakness of our government, and that's why Ukraine should be ruled by 'real Ukrainian patriots'. His slogan 'Ukraine for the Ukrainians' is attractive to many citizens, especially in Western Ukraine, and graffiti has been spotted in a number of towns. This could be dangerous for the cabinet, since we've already lost considerable support in the East."
ukraine.7.a: "Welcome home I suppose..."
ukraine.8.t: "Khrushchev criticises the Ukrainian government."
ukraine.8.d: "Nikita Khrushchev, a prominent Ukrainian social democrat, has opened the 3rd Congress of the Ukrainian Syndicalist Party. He demands that the government takes extreme measures to defend the workers and peasants from poverty brought on by the global crash. To further this agenda he has proposed a new programme of major social and economic reforms aimed at helping Ukraine overcome the crisis. The controversial figure is going to present his plan in the Rada soon."
ukraine.8.a: "Extreme measures? This stinks of Bolshevikism!"
ukraine.9.t: "Our Future"
ukraine.9.d: "The agricultural crisis has almost shattered the Ukrainian economy and the stability of many of the nation's most important institutions. The King's grip on the country is weakening by the hour, peasants loyal to the Hetman want major land reform, pro-Russian malcontents and Ukrainian nationalists demand radical measures and the Syndicalists are mobilising workers all over the country. Various political movements struggle for power in our teetering nation, and soon we have to choose who will lead Ukraine into the future."
ukraine.9.a: "Ukraine will stagger on as it always has!"
ukraine.10.t: "Khrushchev's Speech"
ukraine.10.d: "As one of the few social democrats in the Rada, Nikita Khrushchev wields an mesmerising degree of influence over the Ukrainian peasantry and urban rabble. He has taken advantage of our troubles in a recent speech, where he has openly called for sweeping land reforms, an extension of the electoral franchise and an end to landlord dominance in the countryside. These demands are extremely popular among the lower classes, and are giving them ideas dangerous to national stability. Despite this, perhaps we could make use of Khrushchev's popularity and allow him to become the face of economic reforms unpopular amongst the rural landlords that we would otherwise take a political hit over anyway."
ukraine.10.a: "Dismiss Skoropadsky and invite Khrushchev to head a popular government."
ukraine.11.t: "The Language Issue"
ukraine.11.d: "Nikita Khrushchev has joined the government as leader during one of the darkest periods in our nation's history since 1918. However, before solving the economic problems it is imperative that Khrushchev respond to the burgeoning pro-Russian movement, which has had a malign impact on our electorate in industrial Ukraine. One method that could help neutralise their popularity is by addressing the language question, a domestic dilemma that has been lingering for years. The Russian language is used de-facto by a substantial percentage of the population, however its usage is expressly prohibited in state institutions. This has given rise to accusations that Russians are treated as second-class citizens."
ukraine.11.a: "Make Russian the second official state language."
ukraine.11.b: "Arrest important pro-Russian leaders."
ukraine.12.t: "National-Syndicalists Protest!"
ukraine.12.d: "Notable Ukrainian National-Syndicalists Vlas Chubar and Alexander Shumsky oppose Khrushchev's decision to allow the usage of the Russian language in administrative institutions. They claim that this measure won't help to unify our country and that unopposed usage of the Russian language will lead to the growth of the separatist organisations in Southern and Eastern Ukrainian."
ukraine.12.a: "Millions of our workers don't think so."
ukraine.12.b: "All right, all right. Restore the status quo."
ukraine.13.t: "Pro-Russian Leaders Stir Up Trouble"
ukraine.13.d: "Leaders of the different pro-Russian movements have unfortunately managed to escape Ukrainian soil before they could be arrested. Many have sought temporary exile in Romania and Russia, with both nations somewhat hostile to our pro-German regime and aware of the Kaiser's gaze turning west. Mikhail Bulgakov has announced publicly that the nationalist umbrella organisation 'Faith and Nation' is ready to fight for the rights of Russians in Ukraine. Maybe we have made a big mistake."
ukraine.13.a: "Another problem!"
ukraine.14.t: "Profits From Increased Taxation on the Kulaks"
ukraine.14.d: "Our decision to raise taxes on the Kulak landlords and spend this money on the poorest peasants has helped to stabilise our agriculture sector. 60-70% of the state and private farms are estimated to now be entirely self-supporting. As a result of our increased support from the villages and farms we can turn to other pressing issues with our faltering economy."
ukraine.14.a: "That's one fire extinguished."
ukraine.15.t: "Another Crisis!"
ukraine.15.d: "Our government's decision to divide the property of the Kulaks has led to a second crisis among the farmers. Our collectivisation attempts have ended in a total failure, with agricultural yields from the new collectivised farms cumulatively less than the smallholdings that they replaced. Unbelievably the situation in Ukraine has managed to deteriorate even further!"
ukraine.15.a: "Proof that Syndicalism doesn't always work."
ukraine.16.t: "The Fate of the Ukrainian Monarchy"
ukraine.16.d: "His Majesty King Vasily I Vyshyvaniy gave Nikita Khrushchev extensive powers in a bid to control the revolutionary trends sweeping the country in the aftermath of the crisis. Now that Khrushchev's initial programme has been implemented successfully, many interest groups within Ukraine have begun debating the continued prominence of the monarchy considering its relative powerlessness in the face of recent crises."
ukraine.16.a: "The bourgeoisie like liberty, but would prefer a less radical government."
ukraine.16.b: "The poor love Khrushchev, but hate the King! Long live the Republic!"
ukraine.16.c: "The King shall invite Volodymyr Chekhivsky to save the people and the kingdom."
ukraine.17.t: "A New Minister of Security?"
ukraine.17.d: "Igor Kistyakovsky has been our minister of Security since 1918 but recently had to retire from his post because of his poor health. 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian Nationalists' have immediately started fighting for this position because each party hopes to increase their influence over Ukrainian internal policy. We have to give 'ViN' or 'OUN' this post, according to the power-sharing agreement concluded before the elections."
ukraine.17.a: "Vladimir Khitrovo from 'ViN'"
ukraine.17.b: "Vladimir Chekhovsky from 'OUN'"
ukraine.17.c: "Daniil Skoropadsky, son of our Hetman."
ukraine.18.t: "Free Trade Area With the Ukraine"
ukraine.18.d: "The new Ukrainian government has sought to reconstruct the economy by establishing a free trade area between the Ukraine and the Russian market. This virtual erasure of eye-watering tarrifs and customs duties at the border would be a substantial boon for our own merchants and industrialists. Furthermore, opening up the largely agrarian Ukrainian market to Russian importers desperate to feed the austerity-hit masses in Russia's major cities would massively boost our economy..."
ukraine.18.a: "Launch this project!"
ukraine.19.t: "Free Trade Area Results in Profits"
ukraine.19.d: "The free trade area with Ukraine has shown its benefits. The borderlands, which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg, are now home to a number of new collieries and ironworks and our urban poor now have access to cheap Ukrainian grain to supplement their diet. The unemployment rate has been reduced substantially in certain key sectors. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
ukraine.19.a: "Great."
ukraine.20.t: "Free Trade Area Results in Profits"
ukraine.20.d: "The free trade area with Russia has shown its benefits. The borderlands, which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg, are now home to a number of new collieries and ironworks and our grain, previously rotting in the fields, now has access to a massive market in the form of the Russian urban poor. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest level since 1918. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
ukraine.20.a: "Great."
ukraine.21.t: "Prosvita is Effective!"
ukraine.21.d: "The activities of the Prosvita Movement have had a demonstrably positive influence on our youth, with membership numbers soaring into the hundreds of thousands at least. A number of young people are ready to defend their country, culture and traditions. They will be perfect recruits for our armed forces."
ukraine.21.a: "That's right young men, enrol in the army!"
ukraine.22.t: "Regional Languages"
ukraine.22.d: "Though Skoropadsky refused to recognise the Russian language as a second state language, he allowed the Ukrainian regions to choose which languages could be officially recognised. Now that the majority of our regions have recognised the Russian language, Skoropadsky has finally conceded to give it the same position in a national scale."
ukraine.22.a: "'Yazyk' and 'Mova' should have a common future in Ukraine!"
ukraine.23.t: "Ukraine Request Recovery Aid"
ukraine.23.d: "The Ukrainian government has asked us for a relatively substantial loan, which they wish to use for the electrification of the poorest grain-growers. One of our major Reichspakt allies and the bastion of our Ostwall against a Russian resurgence, Ukraine's situation is already incredibly unstable, in part due to our protectionist measures during Black Week that proved detrimental to Ukrainian agriculture."
ukraine.23.a: "Very well. Grant them the money."
ukraine.23.b: "Who cares about Ukraine?"
ukraine.24.t: "Germany Grants Us a Loan!"
ukraine.24.d: "The German Empire has accepted our request! Now we can invest this money into the electrification of the villages in Central Ukraine, which promises to increase our support amongst the peasantry, boost our agricultural productivity and improve our rural economy. Germany's decision is perhaps not surprising. Ukraine is, after all, a much better place to invest in than Poland!"
ukraine.24.a: "Germany is truly our friend and protector!"
ukraine.25.t: "The Electrification is Complete!"
ukraine.25.d: "With the aid of loans from the German government, our government has finally been able to electrify virtually all of the villages in Central Ukraine, greatly improving the agricultural yields of our peasant farms. As a result of this and our previous measures Ukraine has finally begun to recover from the crushing effects of Black Monday."
ukraine.25.a: "Great!"
ukraine.26.t: "Germany Has Declined to Grant Us a Loan!"
ukraine.26.d: "The German Empire is not going to help us with investment. We must either increase our taxes or abandon this plan."
ukraine.26.a: "We can use our own resources. Time to raise the taxes."
ukraine.26.b: "These reforms weren't necessary anyway..."
ukraine.27.t: "The Electrification is Complete!"
ukraine.27.d: "Even though Germany refused to grant us loans, our government has finally been able to electrify virtually all of the villages in Central Ukraine through increased taxation, greatly improving the agricultural yields of our peasant farms. As a result of this and our previous measures Ukraine has finally begun to recover from the crushing effects of Black Monday."
ukraine.27.a: "It was worth it."
ukraine.28.t: "Another Ukrainian Loan"
ukraine.28.d: "The Ukrainian government asked us for a loan again, which they want to use for the industrialisation of the Eastern part of the Ukraine to quell Syndicalist power there. However, the size of this loan is much bigger than the one before. Many senior personnel in our administration believe that the rise of Syndicalism in Ukraine is a direct threat to Reichspakt solidarity."
ukraine.28.a: "Very well, give them the money."
ukraine.28.b: "There is a crisis in Germany, you know."
ukraine.29.t: "Germany Granted Us Another Loan"
ukraine.29.d: "The German Empire has accepted our request for further capital! Now we can invest this money into the industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine. It should help us to defeat the burgeoning Syndicalist movement there."
ukraine.29.a: "Very well."
ukraine.30.t: "Industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine"
ukraine.30.d: "Many workers in Eastern Ukraine have gotten new jobs in emerging industries due to our investment there, funded by the loan from Germany. As a result our loyalty amongst the urban poor has grown immensely, greatly neutering the power of the Syndicalist movement there. We have recovered from Black Monday, while also crippling the power base of the trade unions!"
ukraine.30.a: "Two birds with one stone. Fantastic!"
ukraine.31.t: "Germany Refused A Second Loan!"
ukraine.31.d: "The Germany Empire is not going to help us with investment in our industrial East, shortsightedly forgetting that the more power Syndicalism gains in Eastern Europe, the greater the threat to their interests. We must choose whether to increase our taxes or abandon this plan entirely."
ukraine.31.a: "Time to raise taxes."
ukraine.31.b: "It's too damn expensive!"
ukraine.32.t: "The Industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine"
ukraine.32.d: "Many workers in Eastern Ukraine have gotten new jobs in emerging industries due to our investment there, funded by extra taxes levied on the population. As a result our loyalty amongst the urban poor has grown immensely, greatly neutering the power of the Syndicalist movement there. We have recovered from Black Monday, while also crippling the power base of the trade unions!"
ukraine.32.a: "Two birds with one stone. Fantastic!"
ukraine.33.t: "Ukraine asks for help!"
ukraine.33.d: "Ukraine, a new Syndicalist nation in Eastern Europe led by Nikita Khrushchev, has requested our support. They cannot start the reform of their industry alone and they have turned to friendly nations overseas for help. There are some plans that have been proposed by our economy minister - the question is which one should we choose?"
ukraine.33.a: "Time to help their military industry!"
ukraine.33.b: "Let's build a brewing facility in Kiev!"
ukraine.33.c: "They can do everything without us."
ukraine.34.t: "Syndicalist Ukraine Leaves the Reichspakt"
ukraine.34.d: "The treacherous Ukrainians have deserted the Reichspakt, jeopardising the sphere of influence in Eastern European that we have spent twenty years carefully constructing. Many hotheads in the general staff have suggesed direct military action to punish the new Syndicalist government and deter other potential insurrectionists. Doing so could be extremely unwise however as Ukraine possesses one of the largest armed forces in Europe and they are critical for our long-term plans as a bulwark against a belligerent Russia. Members of the Abwehr have instead suggested that we ought to use our ties with many senior Ukrainian army officials to instigate a reactionary coup d'etat in Kiev. The choice now is how we should react to this clear betrayal."
ukraine.34.a: "We do not have the resources to respond."
ukraine.34.b: "Covert operations should be resolve this."
ukraine.34.c: "Crush the Syndicalist traitors!"
ukraine.35.t: "German Military Mission Leaves the Ukraine"
ukraine.35.d: "Following our decision to leave the hated the Reichspakt bloc, the German military mission present in our country since 1918 has finally left! Already, officers and advisers that had been stationed on the Ostwall, in Sevastopol and the capital Kiev, have been surreptitiously evacuated over the course of the day. This is truly a testament to an independent Ukraine."
ukraine.35.a: "The chains are broken, for now at least."
ukraine.36.t: "'Arsenal'"
ukraine.36.d: "On January 29, 1918, the workers of the factory 'Arsenal' in Kiev organised an armed pro-Bolshevik mutiny known as a January Rebellion against the Central Rada, the Ukrainian assembly that declared the independence of Ukraine during the Russian Civil War. Since then, the government has failed to interfere with the poor administration of the factory, fearing their actions accidentally sparking a worker's revolt in Kiev. After the triumph of Syndicalism in Ukraine however, the French Commune has decided to help us with the revival of the factory. 'Arsenal' will mainly produce artillery, anti-tank, and anti-aircraft guns, all of which our nation, surrounded by forces hostile to our revolutionary ideology, desperately need."
ukraine.36.a: "God bless the French."
ukraine.37.t: "Ukraine Requests To Join The Internationale"
ukraine.37.d: "The government of the Ukraine have recently announced their intention of joining the Syndicalist bloc in the face of German reactionism in Eastern Europe. Unlike the vast majority of Internationale members Ukraine's Syndicalist government stems not from revolutionary activity, but working with monarchists and German stooges in government - making them most unorthodox. Still, Ukrainian peasants would be useful in the crusade against the bloodthirsty Germans and Canadian pigs."
ukraine.37.a: "Together we shall envelop the hated Bosche!"
ukraine.37.b: "Their chain-breaking credentials are... unworthy."
ukraine.38.t: "We Join the International"
ukraine.38.d: "The International is happy to see us joining the common cause, namely, destroying the evil imperialists. Now we are in the Syndicalist bloc we are part of a united struggle that stretches from Luhanks to London. Only together can we survive in the face of reactionary terror."
ukraine.38.a: "We will defend our liberty and independence!"
ukraine.39.t: "Attempt at a Military Coup"
ukraine.39.d: "German agitators, with the help of reactionary officers and a part of our armed forces, have launched a coup against our government and are trying to restore the pro-German regime in Ukraine. Elements of the Military Mission that had previously been deployed in key garrisons on the Ostwall, in Sevastopol port and in the capital joined forces with pro-German troops and have started running street battles near the ministry buildings. The country is in absolute chaos and liable to deteriorate further, with the survival of Syndicalism in Ukraine on a knife-edge. How will the situation develop?"
ukraine.39.a: "The reactionary putschists secure Kiev!"
ukraine.39.b: "The Red militias successfully defend Kiev!"
ukraine.40.t: "Reactionary Coup in the Ukraine Succeeds"
ukraine.40.d: "Members of the German Military Mission together, with reactionary members of the Ukrainian armed forces, have successfully seized control of Kiev, overthrowing the Syndicalist government and replacing it with one again loyal to the German Empire. After a number of street battles and open warfare raging in government buildings, the putschists began purging Reds wherever they could find them. A nervous King Vasily was given sweeping powers by a pliant Rada and again signed Ukraine up as a formal member of the Reichspakt. We have successfully prevented the poison of Syndicalism from spreading any further in Eastern Europe, and for this the Abwehr should be commended."
ukraine.40.a: "Excellent!"
ukraine.41.t: "Military Coup in the Ukraine Failed"
ukraine.41.d: "Our attempt to replace the government in Ukraine with one loyal to our state has failed miserably. Though our Military Mission staff and a number of anti-Syndicalist elements of the Ukrainian army managed to launch a coup d'etat in Kiev and seize a number of government buildings, they were swiftly overwhelmed by Red militias and executed en-masse. What should we do now? Already widows of the fallen are baying for blood."
ukraine.41.a: "There is nothing we can do..."
ukraine.41.b: "War will solve this!"
ukraine.42.t: "'Obolon'"
ukraine.42.d: "Nikita Khrushchev knows that the workers and peasants of Ukraine deserve a chance for a happier, better life, which is why he always pays serious attention to the needs of the ordinary people. The French government has proposed an excellent idea that aligns with his thinking. The Commune has offered to invest in the largest nationalised brewing facility in Europe, allowing us to greatly expand it and lower the price of cheap alcohol. The expansion of the factory, named 'Obolon', will definitely give us increased support among the low and middle classes of the Ukrainian society. After all, who doesn't like alcohol?"
ukraine.42.a: "An astute proposal!"
ukraine.43.t: "No support from France!"
ukraine.43.d: "Though the Commune of France knows about our internal problems, it seems that they are not going to help us... at least for the moment. This is perhaps not too surprising given the situation that they find themselves in. Despite the setback, we have to be persistent and hope that we will improve our relations with the strongest Syndicalist nation in the world in future."
ukraine.43.a: "Let's hope they won't forget us completely."
ukraine.44.t: "Ukrainian Claim On Bessarabia"
ukraine.44.d: "Bessarabia was occupied by Romanian Forces on the 27th of March, 1918. Back then, we couldn't do a thing, but now we might just have a chance to set this injustice right. Since the current international situation is favourable for us, we should renew our claims on Bessarabia and retake it from Romania."
ukraine.44.a: "The Iron Guard must accept our demands."
ukraine.44.b: "The King must give us back our land!"
ukraine.45.t: "Ukrainian Demands"
ukraine.45.d: "Yesterday, the Ukrainian government demanded the return of the Bessarabia region that we seized back in 1918. If we fold to the Ukrainian claims, we will lose a substantial portion of our territory and the name of the Iron Legion will live on infamy, but if we refuse, we could very well face an immediate invasion by our powerful neighbour. How should we react to these dreadful demands from our northern rival?"
ukraine.45.a: "Accept their demands."
ukraine.45.b: "Never! Bessarabia is Romanian!"
ukraine.46.t: "Iron Guard Romania Refuses!"
ukraine.46.d: "The Iron Guard leadership in Romania have published a note, which insists that Bessarabia is rightful Romanian territory, and that no Ukrainian soldier will set foot on its sovereign territory. The treatise is filled with xenophobic remarks and references to history which have caused outrage and dismay in government circles, and upon it being leaked to the press, the wider public. The Romanian Legionaries have given us great offence."
ukraine.46.a: "Then it is war!"
ukraine.46.b: "Return Bessarabia."
ukraine.47.t: "Ukrainian Demands"
ukraine.47.d: "Yesterday, the Ukrainian government demanded the return of the Bessarabia region that we seized back in 1918. If we fold to the Ukrainian claims, we will lose a substantial portion of our territory and besmirch the dignity of our Crown, but if we refuse, we could very well face an immediate invasion by our powerful neighbour. How should we react to these dreadful demands from our northern rival?"
ukraine.47.a: "Accept their terms."
ukraine.47.b: "Never!"
ukraine.48.t: "Romania refuses!"
ukraine.48.d: "The Romanian King has published a note, where he insists that Bessarabia is rightful Romanian territory, and that no Ukrainian soldier will set foot on his sovereign territory. The only solution to this problem is the war with the Romanians."
ukraine.48.a: "Then it is war."
ukraine.48.b: "Return Bessarabia."
ukraine.52.t: "An Heir to King Vasily?"
ukraine.52.d: "Unfortunately, our King has no children and as such theoretically has the right to choose his successor. In practice however, this decision is up to the Ukrainian government itself and only two candidates are even being considered by senior ministers. The nephew of Vasily, Leo Stefan Habsburg and Daniil Skoropadsky, son of our Hetman, are both contenders for the throne. 'ViN' and 'OUN' support Daniil as they believe he will weaken Ukrainian dependence on the Reichspakt by virtue of his lack of royal ties with the European dynasties. Leo, despite his dynastic ties, only has support from Skoropadsky's opponents and employers, many of whom have serious connections with Germany and Austria. The question now is which is preferable. Some also propose to abolish the German monarchy which was imposed on us at the death of the King."
ukraine.52.a: "Leo Stefan Habsburg!"
ukraine.52.b: "Daniil Skoropadsky!"
ukraine.52.c: "The time of the monarchy will soon be over..."
ukraine.53.t: "A New Minister of Security?"
ukraine.53.d: "Igor Kistyakovsky has been our minister of Security since 1918 but recently had to retire from his post because of his poor health. 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian Nationalists' have immediately started fighting for this position because each party hopes to increase their influence over Ukrainian internal policy. We have to give 'ViN' or 'OUN' this post, according to the power-sharing agreement concluded before the elections."
ukraine.53.a: "Vladimir Khitrovo from 'ViN'."

ukraine.53.c: "Daniil Skoropadsky, son of our Hetman."
ukraine.54.t: "Explosion on the Dnieper"
ukraine.54.d: "Today at 11 a.m. while our King Vasily was relaxing on his yacht, an explosion ripped through the hull immediately killing him. Our minister of security has just received a telegram from a Syndicalist group claiming responsibility for mining His yacht, stating that the action was as a result of their exclusion from the democratic process. There was no chance to save our King and already the country has been plunged into disorder. The new monarch, Leo Stefan Habsburg, has promised to work with the new ruling party to suppress the Syndicalist threat."

ukraine.61.t: "Treaty of Pereyaslav"
ukraine.61.d: "Since the dismemberment of the Russian Empire after the Weltkrieg, both Russia and the Ukraine have been independent countries with their own destinies. At the same time, both states have proven to be weaker apart than united. Now, with each state having reached some level of domestic stability, more and more citizens in both nations are calling for reunification particularly due to the rule of the Russophile Vera i Narod party in Ukraine. Although it could lead to a split with the Reichspakt this might be the one great chance for Great and Little Rus to reunite into a resurgent Greater Russia - a state that can confidently oppose Germanic hegemony in Eastern Europe."
ukraine.61.a: "Together with Russia, the Ukraine shall prosper for a thousand years!"
ukraine.61.b: "We must retain independence!"
ukraine.62.t: "Ratification of the Treaty of Pereyaslav"

At the same time, both states have proven to be weaker apart than united.

Although it could lead to a split with the Reichspakt this might be the one great chance for Great and Little Rus to reunite into a resurgent Greater Russia - a state that can confidently oppose Germanic hegemony in Eastern Europe. Now that we have received a Ukrainian proposition for reunification, how should we react?"

ukraine.63.t: "Western Ukraine Accepts Our Rule"
ukraine.63.d: "After some time witnessing the efficiency and justice of the union between Russia and the Ukraine, the reluctant inhabitants of the Western parts of the Ukraine have finally accepted the benefits and self-evident righteousness of the reunification of Little and Great Russia. What was once two nations divided by our enemies has become one indivisible whole, and it is all the stronger for the tribulations we have both endured."
ukraine.63.a: "Proud Russians all."
ukraine.64.t: "Russian Annexation of the Ukraine!"
ukraine.64.d: "Terrible news from Ukraine. The pro-Russian government has decided to unify with our Russian rivals, throwing our entire Eastern Policy into complete disarray. We have lost main Ostwall outpost!"
ukraine.64.a: "It's war!"
ukraine.64.b: "A two front war is untimely, but necessary!"
ukraine.64.c: "Well they were with Mother Russia before..."
ukraine.67.t: "Economic Self-Confidence"
ukraine.67.d: "Since 1918, we have been critically dependent on German consumer goods to fill our markets. Indeed, many in our nationalist government have postulated that this state of affairs is an intentional part of the Reich's plans to castrate us and turn us into little more than a pathetic puppet, hopelessly reliant on them. On account of our dependency, our farmers aren't able to develop their own businesses and compete with well-funded German freeholders, many of whom hold key positions in our economy. We have to reconstruct our national agriculture market and end this shameful dependence on the German Empire. This is no time for diplomatic niceties."
ukraine.67.a: "Announce an embargo on German goods!"
ukraine.67.b: "There is no reason to resort to economic warfare."
ukraine.68.t: "Ukrainian Embargo"
ukraine.68.d: "The new Ukrainian nationalist government has decided to intentionally reduce our participation in their domestic markets through a series of draconian trade measures, equating in effect to a near-total embargo on our goods. This poses a major problem for our farmers because Ukraine was a big and perspective outlet for their products. Furthermore, we have traditionally been reliant on Ukrainian grain to feed our armed forces. This behaviour by Ukraine is unbelievable considering all we have done for them!"
ukraine.68.a: "Demand a reversal of this outrageous embargo!"
ukraine.68.b: "We can stomach this indignity."
ukraine.69.t: "German Empire Demands an End to the Embargo"
ukraine.69.d: "Our unexpected embargo shocked and angered the German government due to its effects on the Reich's agricultural sector and their need for our grain to serve their military. The Germans have demanded that we immediately end our protectionist trade measures or else they will begin to strip us of our Reichspakt membership. This embargo has begun to strengthen our economic self-sufficiency and power, but being thrown out of the Reichspakt suddenly may be harmful to us. What should we do?"
ukraine.69.a: "Comply and remove the embargo."
ukraine.69.b: "Maintain the embargo, we must protect our peasants!"
ukraine.70.t: "First Results of the Embargo"
ukraine.70.d: "Our decision to impose an effective embargo on German goods to help our national producers has thankfully led to a stabilisation in our agricultural sector. Perhaps 70% of the state and private farms can now be called self-supporting. As a result we can solve more difficult problems in our economy, since we have support in the villages and farms."
ukraine.70.a: "The bread's back in the breadbasket of Europe!"
ukraine.71.t: "Ukraine proposes an alliance!"
ukraine.71.d: "Ukraine has come to us offering a military alliance, promising us access to their vast agricultural system, Black Sea ports and the undermining of Germany's the Reichspakt bloc. While it'd certainly be good to stand with our Slavic brothers, the reaction from Germany would be unfavourable to say the least. What should we do?"
ukraine.71.a: "Accept the offer!"
ukraine.71.b: "We do not need this."
ukraine.72.t: "Russia Accepted The Proposal!"
ukraine.72.d: "Russia agreed that we should be in the same alliance, which will secure Eastern Europe both from the German imperialists and Syndicalist threat. the Reichspakt couldn't make us hate our brothers from Great Russia, which is why we decided to form this alliance - and we believe it will also be profitable for us."
ukraine.72.a: "That's what Khmelnitsky wanted 300 years ago!"
ukraine.73.t: "Ukraine Abandons the Reichspakt For Russia"
ukraine.73.d: "An absolutely disgraceful situation has emerged on our eastern flank. Ukraine, supposedly our loyal ally and the linchpin of our Ostwall defences, has left the Reichspakt and entered an alliance with the Russians, asserting their independence from German control. Diplomatic heads have been rolling in Berlin all day. We can't risk a war with the Russians over Ukraine regardless of what some officials are calling for, surely?"
ukraine.73.a: "They aren't worth it!"

ukraine.75.a: "True brotherhood with another Kaiser"
ukraine.76.t: "White Guard"
ukraine.76.d: "'The White Guard' ('Belaya Gvardiya') is a film, based on the novel written by the leader of the pro-Russian movement, Mikhail Bulgakov. The film's story describes the life of one Russian family in Kiev just after the German occupation in 1918. The main characters are the Russian officers and Ukrainian citizens that participated in the defence of Kiev from those disloyal to the new regime of Ukrainian Nationalists and different socialist groups comprised of soldiers in the army of Hetman Skoropadsky. The film analyses the relations between the Russians and the Ukrainians. Conceived by Bulgakov as a symbol of national reconciliation, 'The White Guard' encourages the unity of the Kingdom and friendship of its people, though some radical groups of the local nationalists consider this film to be Russian propaganda."
ukraine.76.a: "Long live our people, united and free!"
ukraine.77.t: "Rifles and carbines"
ukraine.77.d: "Produced by Alexander Dovzhenko, the film 'Rifles and carbines' ('Gvintivki ta karabini') is devoted to the story of the struggle between the Russian White forces under General Drozdovskiy and the forces of the Ukrainian Kingdom in 1918 in the south during the Iassy-Don March. The film, which was conceived to be an answer to the Bulgakov's 'White Guard' doesn't try to point out possible methods of reconciliation, but raises by implication the potential for separatists and spies of foreign powers to still be hiding among the Ukrainian population and both willing and able to try to exploit its weakness."
ukraine.77.a: "Death to the enemies of Ukraine!"
ukraine.78.t: "Kulak’s Targeted by Land Expropriation"
ukraine.78.d: "Nikita Krushchev has been tasked with resolving Ukraine’s economic stagnation, in a speech to parliament Kruschev announced a new economic programme aimed at collectivising the vast lands used by Kulaks for agriculture. According to this proposed programme by integrating privately owned landholdings into state run collectively-controlled farms, a greater crop yield can be achieved. Some within parliament have shown opposition to this programme stating the unwillingness of Kulaks to hand over their land to the state. It is to be seen how successful this programme will be."
ukraine.78.a: "A bold strategy from Kruschev..."
ukraine.79.t: "The Red Hetman of Revolutionary Ukraine"
ukraine.79.d: "Since the birth of the current Ukrainian state, the Ukranian people have been subjected to ridicule. Mass poverty amongst the working class, ruled by an Austrian puppet king whilst subservient to the German Empire. It appeared to many that the future of this nation was hopeless, that changed with one man. Comrade Khrushchev has taken the mantle of leadership, proving himself to be a modern equivalent to the legendary Hetmans. Khrushchev has firmly booted foreign imperialistic influences whilst pulling the poor out of plight, providing a new hope for all Ukrainians!"
ukraine.79.a: "Long live Comrade Khrushchev!"
ukraine.80.t: "Kulaks Face Taxation"
ukraine.80.d: "Nikita Krushchev has been tasked with resolving Ukraine’s economic stagnation, in a speech to parliament Krushchev announced a new economic programme aimed at increasing profits for the state. Originally Krushchev had wished to collectivise the lands owned by Ukraine’s peasant landowners, the Kulaks, however facing much opposition within parliament he has been forced to take a more moderate stance. Instead increased taxation will be enforced upon the Kulaks whose large workforce and high yields will continue to fulfill the populace’s needs whilst generating additional profits."
ukraine.80.a: "Surely these farmers won't mind a few less pennies in return for their land."
ukraine.81.t: "A place in the world for Ukraine"
ukraine.81.d: "For the longest time, the Ukrainian nation has been split, conquered, ruled over, been subordinate. For the first time in many centuries however we are finally free from the German, Russian and more alike, sovereign is our people and now they look toward the bright future. However it seems as however bright that future is, one thing cannot be clearly seen through the radiant sun rays is exactly what kind of Sovereignity the Ukrainian nation should exercize, many of our people wish only to enjoy their new found freedom in peace while others wish for us to look outward as a actor of the world stage rather than inward."
ukraine.81.a: "Ukraine will only have part in Ukrainian affairs"
ukraine.81.b: "This alliance suits us still"
ukraine.81.c: "Ukraine is a true power, we will act like it!"
ukraine.82.t: "Military Command Seized by Khrushchev!"
ukraine.82.d: "The Ukrainian Armed Forces have been infested by reactionary nationalists since its formation, these politically connected generals serve to promote ideas that conflict with Comrade Khrushchev’s  grand revolutionary plans. Therefore it is unacceptable to maintain the current military command structure, these reactionaries will be demoted and replaced will those loyal to our great Comrade, for the sake of stability and avoiding any possible outright insurgencies it has been advised not to completely purge these generals. For now at least..."
ukraine.82.a: "Loyalty has its rewards..."
ukraine.83.t: "Populyarnyy front"
ukraine.83.d: "The Popular Front is a common name used to refer to an unofficial coalition of left-wing forces, primarily composing of moderate social-democrats, socialists and vanguardists. Despite the conflicting views held by the factions they remain a united force primarily thanks to Khrushchev, whose cult like following amongst the peasantry has allowed himself and his allies to coerce the moderates into remaining loyal. For now Khrushchev has held back on previous radical promises such as the abolishment of the monarchy in order to appease the social democratic majority who wish for progressive change, his increasingly vague stances have helped maintain the Front’s unity whilst not completely rejecting the will of his hardcore supporters. The social-democratic majority also serves as a tool used by Khrushchev to appeal to Vasyl who would surely oppose co-operation had the vanguardists been given a larger platform."
ukraine.83.a: "Let us see how long this lasts..."
ukraine.84.t: "The New Ukraine"
ukraine.84.d: "Once defined by its peasantry dominated agricultural society, Ukraine was always a battle-ground between Russian and European influence and control. Previously lacking a respectable government that put the Ukrainian people first, the tryrannical German bootlicking monarchy is no more. The old backwards Ukraine is no more. Thanks to Comrade Khruschev the Ukranian state is rapidly industrialising and modernising. Although set back by Kulak resistance and mismanagement of collective farming, the nation has rebounded with a centralised economic plan based upon the ever growing factories that now dominate the farmland. The future of Ukraine is now!"
ukraine.84.a: "Without Comrade Khrushchev there would be no new Ukraine!"
ukraine.85.t: "The Coronation"
ukraine.85.d: "Due to the nature of Vasyl's death, his successor was unable to have a proper coronation. That was, until today when [ROOT.GetSuccessorName] was crowned King of all the Ukrainians by Metropolitan Mykola Boretsky in the St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev. Today is a great day for all Ukrainians as we finally rid ourselves of the legacy of the old Kingdom."
ukraine.85.a: "What an exciting event!"
ukraine.86.t: "Mikhail Bulgakov Arrested!"
ukraine.86.d: "With our recent crackdown against the terrorist organisation 'Faith and Nation' better known as ViN in full swing, our loyal police officers have raided a suspected ViN safehouse and arrested the organisation's leader, Mikhail Bulgakov. With him arrested, the organisation will likely crumble without any leadership."
ukraine.86.a: "Death to the enemies of the state!"
ukraine.87.t: "Dmytro Dontsov Arrested!"
ukraine.87.d: "With our recent crackdown against the terrorist Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists better known as the OUN in full swing, our loyal police officers have raided a suspected OUN safehouse and arrested the organisation's leader, Dmytro Dontsov. With him arrested, the organisation will likely crumble without any leadership."
ukraine.87.a: "Death to the enemies of the state!"
ukraine.88.t: "Vasyl Calls for Snap Elections"
ukraine.88.d: "With no party attaining a majority in the Rada, King Vasyl, perhaps out of fear for a Syndicalist revolution, has called for snap elections across Ukraine, with voting to be held in one month's time. There have also been raucous protests on the main square in Kyiv to ban the more extreme reactionary parties from the ballot in fears that they may jeopardize the integrity of the election."
ukraine.88.a: "Allow ballot access."
ukraine.88.b: "Take the reactionaries and Russian sympathizers off the ballot!"
ukraine.89.t: "The [GetYear] Rada Elections"
ukraine.89.d: "For the first time in Ukraine's history, free elections are finally here at last and everyday Ukrainians are clamoring to have a voice in the government. The results are in, and the winner is..."
ukraine.89.a: "The social-democratic Federalist wing of the Ukrainian Party of Socialists."
ukraine.89.b: "The agrarian Peasant's Party."
ukraine.89.c: "The national liberal People's Party."
ukraine.89.e: "The Russophile Faith and Nation party."
ukraine.89.f: "The conservative Ukrainian National Democratic Party."
ukraine.89.g: "The far-right Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists."
ukraine.89.h: "The Christian-democratic Christian Social Movement in Ukraine."
ukraine.890.d: "The [GetYear] elections are finally upon us. Who shall take control?"
ukraine.90.t: "Skoropadsky dissolves the Rada!"
ukraine.90.d: "Perhaps bolstered by success in the elections, the UND-controlled Rada has voted to dissolve the Supreme Rada once and for all, and instead replace them with a loyal State Senate, so Skoropadsky and the UND never has to deal with any more challenges to his power. We have the popular mandate, after all."
ukraine.90.a: "No more of this 'election' nonsense."
ukraine.91.t: "A Rightist Coalition"
ukraine.91.d: "After much negotiation, we have decided to form a coalition in the Rada with Pavlo Skoropadsky's UND as well as a 'confidence and supply' agreement with our rivals on the right wing in order to keep the liberal and syndicalist parties from attaining a minority government and preserving the stability of the Kingdom. This should also prevent us from having to hold any more elections."
ukraine.91.a: "An unholy alliance."
ukraine.92.t: "The Fate of Extremist Parties"
ukraine.92.d: "The popular coalition government has served as a bulwark against extremism in this trying time for our nation. After the shocking death of the king who brought democracy to our nation, Syndicalists have been rounded up and banned from government in an effort to prevent those responsible from taking control in the next election. Meanwhile, the Nationalists have more or less become a fringe party and early polls are showing they will likely not reach the threshold to be on the ballot in the next election. Furthermore, reports coming out of Ukrainian newspapers discovered a plot by Pavlo Skoropadsky to undermine Ukrainian democracy by dissolving the Rada had they received a majority in the previous election and as such have been banned from future elections."
ukraine.92.a: "Good riddance!"
ukraine.93.t: "Memories of the Republic"
ukraine.93.d: "While most of the country has been divided between the right-wing elite and the left-wing peasants, there is a growing contingent of middle-class Ukrainians who remember the days of the short-lived UPR, in which everyday people- not only the elites- had a voice in the government. Protests have been mounting in Kyiv in recent days to implement moderate reforms based on the model of Western democracies such as those found in Scandinavia, stopping short of a total governmental overhaul but instead calling for open elections to solve the deadlock in the Rada. While a minority of these protesters are ardent republicans, many seem open to the idea of retaining Vasyl as a constitutional monarch. One of Ukraine's most prominent generals, Symon Petliura, has expressed their support for the protests, saying that allowing free elections to the Rada could go a long way to bridge the gap between left and right, and perhaps even solve the ongoing agricultural crisis."
ukraine.93.a: "Maybe it's time to take them seriously."
ukraine.101.t: "An Overture from Kiev"
ukraine.101.d: "With the recent declaration of an independent alliance between the Black and Baltic seas front in the form of the [ROOT.GetFactionName] by the Ukrainian nation, it seems that we have been invited to join their fold, bolstering their alliance of sovereign nations between the Austrian, German and Russian spheres."
ukraine.101.a: "We must join in brotherhood!."
ukraine.101.b: "We need no aid from the Ukrainians."
ukraine.102.t: "The [From.GetName] joins our cause!"
ukraine.102.d: "Great news in the capital today as following our offer to bring the [From.GetName] into the [ROOT.GetFactionName], we have received positive a positive response from them. Already, diplomats between them and us transit between Kiev and their nation to discuss shared military affairs."
ukraine.102.a: "Splendid!."
ukraine.103.t: "The [From.GetName] refuses us!"
ukraine.103.d: "It would seem that our visit and invitation to the [From.GetName] has gone rather poorly, having only been rebuked upon their arrival. We will have to search for allies elsewhere."
ukraine.103.a: "We didn't need them anyway."
ukraine.104.t: "The German Empire falls to Revolution!"
ukraine.104.d: "In an extrodinary turn of events, the German nation, once the great bulwark against the communards and Russians alike now itself flies the colors of revolution!. Now we are stuck between the Anvil hammer of the Reds and Russians, we must secure Eastern Europe with our other former allies at once!."
ukraine.104.a: "Send the envoys!."

### Focuses ###

UKR_Our_Future: "Our Future"
UKR_Our_Future_desc: "The agricultural crisis has almost shattered the Ukrainian economy and stability in the country. The King barely controls the country, those loyal to the Hetman peasants want land reforms, pro-Russian forces and Nationalists demand radical measures and the Syndicalists mobilise their supporters all over the country..."

UKR_Invite_Khrushchev: "Invite Khrushchev Into Government"
UKR_Invite_Khrushchev_desc: "Nikita Khrushchev, a well-known but controversial Ukrainian social-democrat, proposes the populist idea, very popular among the peasants, of the reorganisation of our agriculture. We have to admit, that that this proposition seems like it can help Ukraine in her time of crisis. Maybe we should invite him into government to implement these reforms?"
UKR_Popular_Front: "Popular Front"
UKR_Popular_Front_desc: "Though we have given Khrushchev free reign to reorganise the economy, many of our legislators in the Rada have prevented any attempt by Khrushchev to reduce the power of the Kulak landlords. That's why Khrushchev has announced a creation of the 'Popular Front', which will unite left members of the Supreme Rada and give him enough authority to change the laws."
UKR_Language_Issue: "Solve The Language Issue"
UKR_Language_Issue_desc: "The Russian language is widespread in Ukraine and the native tongue of many of our citizens, but it has never been an official state language. If we grant Russian a formal role in the Ukrainian state, it will allow us to gain popularity among pro-Russian citizens and solve one of the divisive issues our nation faces."
UKR_Exp_Kulaks: "Expropriate Kulak Holdings"
UKR_Exp_Kulaks_desc: "'Kulaks' or 'Kurkuls' is a category of relatively affluent farmers who are able to hire a lot of the poorest peasants and thus earn an enormous amount of money. Since they are hated by the majority of the peasants, we can easily expropriate they lands and divide them between the poorest peasants in the country."
UKR_Tax_Kulaks: "Increase Kulak Taxation"
UKR_Tax_Kulaks_desc: "'Kulaks' or 'Kurkuls' is a category of relatively affluent farmers who are able to hire a lot of the poorest peasants and thus earn an enormous amount of money. Since they are the only group of the farmers that are still able to fulfil our consumer needs, it would be wise to let them have their lands, but to impose an additional tax on them."
UKR_Coll_Prog: "Collectivisation"
UKR_Coll_Prog_desc: "After the latest agricultural crisis among the 'Kulaks', we have many new poor peasants all over Ukraine. Khrushchev proposes that they can work on new collective farms and produce goods for the state, which will provide them with farming tools and pay them a reasonable salary. This should hopefully, through pooling of resources, boost our total output."
UKR_Fate_Monarchy: "Fate of the Monarchy"
UKR_Fate_Monarchy_desc: "King Vasily has become somewhat of a laughing stock to the Ukrainian people. By handing major powers to Krushchev and seeing more issues solved in months than the King himself had resolved in years he has only highlighted his own irrelevance. A former Austrian puppet king with no Austrian backing, his position is being openly debated by Popular Front members."
UKR_Syn_Rev: "A Red Hetman"
UKR_Syn_Rev_desc: "As the great Hetman Bogdan Khmelnitsky, who once liberated people on both banks of the Dnieper from the Polish yoke, once did; Nikita Khrushchev and the Popular Front deposed the King, the Hetman, and purged the Rada of all elements not willing to embrace the new reality. Finally the people of Ukraine are ready to build new society, one both proud and free!"
UKR_Friendship_Nations: "Unite the People"
UKR_Friendship_Nations_desc: "The capitalists did their best to divide the people of Ukraine, imposing chauvinism and intolerance on the national minorities of our country. But new leadership with Khrushchev is ready to fight this deception and will encourage a policy of unity amongst all citizens of this great nation!"
UKR_Khrushchyovka: "'Khrushchyovka'"
UKR_Khrushchyovka_desc: "'Khrushchyovka' is the unofficial designation for a type of low-cost, concrete-panelled three to five-storied apartment building developed at the request of our leader Nikita Khrushchev. Mass production of these structures should finally solve the housing problem in the rapidly expanding Ukrainian cities and will provide more employment and accommodation to the masses."
UKR_Remove_Khrushchev: "Purge Khrushchev"
UKR_Remove_Khrushchev_desc: "The recent denigration of the royal position has demonstrated that Krushchev and his Popular Front partners are an unacceptable threat to King and Country. We will remove them from all of their offices in a major purge with the Hetman's backing. Once done, we will have to abolish their most radical laws and start to re-calibrate our economy."

UKR_comrade_devotion: "Comrade Devotion"
UKR_comrade_devotion_desc: "Ukraine is whole once more, the nation united in support of Khrushchev’s policies, this nation-wide strive for excellence has created an atmosphere of hard work. Across Ukraine in factories, farms, mines, ports, stores there are dedicated workers forging a new Ukraine!"
UKR_wealth_distribute: "Distribute Our New Wealth"
UKR_wealth_distribute_desc: "Profits gained from the new Kulak taxes will be distributed amongst the poorer labourers in order to decrease economic division. Providing workers with a higher income will boost popularity for Khrushchev and raise the living standards for many. Greed has polluted the nation, it is time for equality for all!"
UKR_new_society: "New Ukrainian Society"
UKR_new_society_desc: "A nation of true freedom, happiness and equality! A united proletariat represented both in the fields labouring and in the government dictating. Now we can declare the foundation of a new nation, one that is directed by socialism!"
UKR_peasant_army: "Revolutionary Peasants' Army"
UKR_peasant_army_desc: "The military of the Ukranian state was mostly composed of reactionary and nationalist commanders, when comrade Khrushchev seized power many of these generals refused to serve under a socialist republican. Therefore Khrushchev has restructured the military into a mass fighting force of proletariat, they may lack in experience whoever they are loyal comrades!"


UKR_Broad_Coalition: "Coalition With The Nationalists"
UKR_Broad_Coalition_desc: "Realising the scale of the Syndicalist threat, Hetman Skoropadsky decided to strike a bargain with the pro-Russian 'ViN' and nationalist 'OUN'. Both parties will get freedom of action in regions where they are especially popular, but in return they will support Skoropadsky's regime and the King in the Rada through a 'confidence and supply' agreement."
UKR_Rightist_Government: "Initial Administrative Reforms"
UKR_Rightist_Government_desc: "Members of 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian Nationalists' have begun to replace Hetman-period officials in the regions en-masse, somewhat upsetting the balance of the Rada. Surprisingly, this has had a positive effect on our economy because eager new local governments are keen to solve the problems afflicting their own towns. The first steps of reform are underway."
UKR_ViN_Russophiles: "Church and Nation"
UKR_ViN_Russophiles_desc: "It seems that Mikhail Bulgakov, with the help of 'ViN', has finally found a method by which the land question can be resolved amicably. The Ukrainian Church, which is a part of the Russian Orthodox Church, will sell vast swathes of mostly unoccupied lands to the peasants at a discount, but Orthodoxy will be recognised as the formal state religion in Ukraine."
UKR_OUN_Nationalists: "Requisition Polish Farms"
UKR_OUN_Nationalists_desc: "A number of Polish landlords control land in Western and Central Ukraine for historical reasons. Since Poland is decidedly weak now, we can easily confiscate their estates, expel these Poles, and redistribute their lands among the Ukrainian peasants. This should also coincidentally appeal to nationalist supporters of both stripes that generally detest the Polish minority."
UKR_Abolish_Law: "Recognise Russian"
UKR_Abolish_Law_desc: "One of the biggest problems which exists in Ukraine is the language question. De-facto, the Russian language is used by a majority of the population, but its usage is prohibited by the state institutions. 'ViN' has always opposed this prohibition and thus it is with great pleasure that Mikhail Bulgakov is now able to abolish this language law."
UKR_Prosvita_Mov: "The Prosvita Movement"
UKR_Prosvita_Mov_desc: "Unfortunately, a sizeable percentage of our population use the Russian language despite the fact that the government doesn't recognise it at a state level for use in national institutions. To combat this, 'OUN' has proposed to invest in a 'Prosvita' ('Education') movement. The aim of 'Prosvita' is to spread Ukrainian language and culture throughout the country, as well as abroad."
UKR_Free_Trade: "Eastern Free Trade Area"
UKR_Free_Trade_desc: "The free trade area with Ukraine has shown its benefits. The borderlands which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg are full of collieries and ironworks now. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest level since 1918. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian co-operation!"
UKR_Resettlement: "Resettlement"
UKR_Resettlement_desc: "The Ukrainian nation is still divided, even though Ukraine itself has been an independent country for almost 20 years. We should address this situation by resettling peasants from Western Ukraine to the East, where they will become workers in the Donbass industrial region. This also will also serve to bring Ukrainian ideas and traditions into this unfriendly 'OUN' region."
UKR_Crisis_Coalition: "Crisis in the Coalition"
UKR_Crisis_Coalition_desc: "Though the Syndicalist threat has mostly melted away due to government reforms, 'ViN' and 'OUN' have gained too much popularity among the citizens of Ukraine and their followers are inadvertently violently splitting our country apart with their nationalistic fervour. This situation cannot continue as the situation in Europe is quickly deteriorating."

UKR_Dissolve_Rada: "Dissolve the Rada"
UKR_Dissolve_Rada_desc: "Our Supreme Rada (Parliament) has always been too left and never really supported Skoropadsky's policies as Hetman. The King has been shaken out of his legislative stupor to grant Skoropadsky the authority to dissolve the Rada and form instead a loyal State Senate, stacked primarily with regime puppets and useful officials from different Ukrainian regions."
UKR_Skoropadsky_Policy: "Ukrainian Unity"
UKR_Skoropadsky_Policy_desc: "The relations between the Russians and the Ukrainians in Ukraine are good enough, but various powers try to depict them as an eternal struggle between the West and the East. We must stop this chauvinistic propaganda, but our aim is also to show that despite the common past and good relations with Russia, we are independent now and will always be."
UKR_Army_Reforms: "A Professional Army"
UKR_Army_Reforms_desc: "It is obvious that the Ukrainian army is incomparable to the Russian and German behemoths, and yet it is still stronger than any neighbouring army. That's why Skoropadsky has proposed re-orientating our army towards a smaller professional force. It will help us maintain our security, and will allow us to reduce our costly defence spending."
UKR_Peasant_State: "Peasant State"
UKR_Peasant_State_desc: "Our peasants have always played a significant role in the country and its economy. With extra money available from our reduced military spending, we can reduce taxes for the poor until our agriculture recovers from Black Monday and we will become the breadbasket of Europe once again."
UKR_Prohibit_Syndicalism: "Prohibit Syndicalism"
UKR_Prohibit_Syndicalism_desc: "We have reached an understanding with the pro-Russian circles, pacified the various Ukrainian movements and helped make the peasantry loyal to us. Now we have to deal with the Syndicalists. Our mass media will start a massive propaganda campaign, showing the Syndies as a malignant tumour on Slavdom. Our efforts will eventually enable us to ban many notorious left parties."
UKR_Federalisation: "Federalisation"
UKR_Federalisation_desc: "The Syndicalists, Nationalists and the Russophiles have all tried to impose their ideas on the whole country. This has demonstrated the flaws of the centralised approach of the Hetmanate. If we give our regions more autonomy and weaken the Supreme Rada, we will be able to stop regional debates becoming flashpoints on the national stage to ensure political chaos remains a thing of the past."

UKR_Snap_Elections: "Call Snap Elections"
UKR_Snap_Elections_desc: "The leader of the Rada, failing to achieve a majority government, has invoked a vote of no confidence in the current Ukrainian government. Falling to public pressure, he has decided to call for the first free and fair elections in nearly 20 years to try and boost legitimacy."
UKR_Popular_Kingdom: "A Popular Hetmanate"
UKR_Popular_Kingdom_desc: "The elections were a rousing success, and one of the popular, pro-Ukrainian parties has taken an absolute majority in the Rada. Despite this, many corrupt elements still exist in the government, and it is our responsibility to ensure those responsible are ousted from power."
UKR_Agrarian_Reform: "Agrarian Reform"
UKR_Agrarian_Reform_desc: "Now that we have a mandate from the people, it is time to take back control of our farms from the German oligarchs. The government has devised a program which provides an incentive system for existing landowners to sell their farmland to the government at above the market rate, from which smaller parcels will then be provided to Ukrainian citizens. Furthermore, we have received permission from the German government to sell our grain outside of the Mitteleuropan sphere, provided these other nations are not considered a direct threat to the Reichspakt and exports to the German sphere take priority."
UKR_Defenders_of_Democracy: "Defenders of Democracy"
UKR_Defenders_of_Democracy_desc: "The Ukrainian armed forces have always been a point of weakness in our young nation. With us sharing much of our border with the unpredictable Russian bear as well as the rising red tide across Europe, it is time to upgrade our armed forces with help from our allies in order to best defend a free Ukraine from threats abroad."
UKR_Ukrainian_Identity: "A Ukrainian Identity"
UKR_Ukrainian_Identity_desc: "While Ukraine as a state has not existed for very long, our nation has existed for hundreds of years. We must invest in education, the arts, and the Ukrainian language so that the people within our borders know what it truly means to be Ukrainian."
UKR_Enshrine_Freedoms: "Enshrine Basic Freedoms"
UKR_Enshrine_Freedoms_desc: "The Rada has passed an amendment to the Ukrainian Constitution, enshrining basic freedoms such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, and perhaps most significantly, freedom to organize into a trade union. The protections of unionization and a free press may not go over well with the Germans, but King Vasyl has publicly announced that such freedoms are necessary to prevent a syndicalist uprising."

UKR_New_Heir: "The Succession Question"
UKR_New_Heir_desc: "King Vasily, as vigorous in his production of heirs as in running the country, has left the royal succession up for debate. There are only two realistic contenders, Leo Stefan Habsburg or Daniil Skoropadsky. Neither are completely ideal but this question must be solved sooner rather than later."
UKR_Explosion_Dnieper: "Explosion on the Dnieper"
UKR_Explosion_Dnieper_desc: "The death of the King has come as a shock to us all, and now one question remains - in what direction will our nation travel in the aftermath?"
UKR_Pereyaslav_treaty: "Treaty of Pereyaslav"
UKR_Pereyaslav_treaty_desc: "With Russian nationalists in charge of the Ukrainian government, the option is now available for us to petition the Russian government for reintegration back into Mother Russia. There is no guarantee that they would risk incurring Germany's wrath by accepting us however."
UKR_OUN_Embargo: "Embargo Germany"
UKR_OUN_Embargo_desc: "With Ukrainian nationalists dominating the government, the time has come to put the Ukrainian people first - by taking a serious gamble. For too long our nation's economy and agricultural sector has been geared towards serving the Germany people at our own expense. This will end. Protectionism is the only way we can assert ourselves."
UKR_Grand_Coronation: "A Grand Coronation"
UKR_Grand_Coronation_desc: "With the Kingdom finally becoming stable once more it has been proposed that a second and grand coronation inside Saint Sophia's Cathedral be prepared. Unfortunately due to the political turmoil following Vasyl's death, [ROOT.GetSuccessorName] was unable to receive a proper coronation. This will be rectified at once."
UKR_Ban_ViN: "Ban ViN"
UKR_Ban_ViN_desc: "The so-called 'Faith and Nation' organisation is little more than a front for russophilic traitors and if they were in power they would see us annexed into the old Empire. With Dontsov assuming the mantle of government it is time to permanently rid ourselves of these treacherous scum."
UKR_Ban_OUN: "Ban The OUN"
UKR_Ban_OUN_desc: "The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists, often referred to as the OUN, has become something of a problem in recent years. With its fervent anti-German rhetoric, they could become a dangerous enemy and the most simplest way to deal with them is ban them and crack down on their operations."
UKR_New_Scientists: "New Scientists"
UKR_New_Scientists_desc: "The main aim of our government has always been stability. With a new atmosphere of relative calm descending on the nation our young people are moving into the sciences and many companies are investing into research. We can only support this process."
UKR_Extend_State_Powers: "Extend The Executive Powers"
UKR_Extend_State_Powers_desc: "The executive powers have always been a bit too weak and this allowed the left-leaning Rada to dominate state affairs. But with the new government in place it is time to extend them so as to create a greater and stronger Ukrainian state."
UKR_Discredit_Democrats: "Discredit Moderate Republicanism"
UKR_Discredit_Democrats_desc: "For many years the moderate republicans of Ukraine have attacked and criticised our rule for various reasons and harken back to the short-lived people's republic. Their influence must be curbed and the legacy of the UNR slandered in the minds of all Ukrainians."
UKR_State_Companies: "State Backed Companies"
UKR_State_Companies_desc: "As the economy begins to grow again we can begin investing in state-backed companies to further our already healthy industrial output and sheild the economy from any further downward trends."
UKR_Secret_Police: "The Bureau Of Special Investigations"
UKR_Secret_Police_desc: "With the last few years being tumultous at best it has been decided that a new kind of police force must be established. One that will strike from the shadows and monitor those extremists in the syndicalists who would see our state crumble."
UKR_Ban_Extremist_Parties: "Fate of Extremist Parties"
UKR_Ban_Extremist_Parties_desc: "After the shocking death of the king, it is time to lay down our differences, come together, and make sure extremism never once again plagues our land."
UKR_Espouse_Democrats: "Espouse Democratic Values"
UKR_Espouse_Democrats_desc: "For many years the moderate republicans of Ukraine had attacked and criticised this country's rule for various reasons and harkened back to the short-lived people's republic. It is because of them that our transition to a full-fledged constitutional monarchy has been so successful. Their influence must be recognized and the legacy of the UNR praised in the minds of all Ukrainians."
UKR_Curb_Executive: "Limit The Executive Powers"
UKR_Curb_Executive_desc: "The executive powers have always been a bit too strong and this allowed extreme reactionaries to dominate state affairs. But with the new government in place it is time to limit executive powers and grant more to the democratically-elected Rada so as to create a greater and more united Ukrainian state."
UKR_Slava_Ukraini: "Glory to Ukraine!"
UKR_Slava_Ukraini_desc: "'Slava Ukraini!'- Glory to Ukraine - is the national salute of Ukraine. First heard in the brief revolution of 1917, it has since been repurposed by right and left alike as a symbol of Ukrainian unity.

UKR_Donbass_Industry: "Rejuvenate Donbass Factories"
UKR_Donbass_Industry_desc: "After a long period of political turbulence, the situation in Ukraine is more or less stable, and we have a good chance to continue reforms.

Irrespective of this hard truth we still have our brave and numerous citizens, who stand ready to work hard and defend Ukraine from the various enemies who want to enslave them!

UKR_Bessarabia_claim: "Blue Danube"
UKR_Bessarabia_claim_desc: "The Russian Empire lost our province of Bessarabia in 1918. Today many Ukrainians and other national minorities live here under the oppression of the corrupt regime in Bucharest, but now is the perfect time for freedom and self-determination to prevail in Bessarabia. We will help liberate the people in this region."
UKR_Fra_cooperation: "Commune Cooperation"
UKR_Fra_cooperation_desc: "The Commune of France is the torch of progress and liberty in Europe. Fortunately Nikita Khrushchev understands that the future belongs to this young and free nation. That's why he proposes that both the Ukrainians and the French should boost economic ties between our countries, which were almost destroyed during the reign of the former Ukrainian king."
UKR_Fra_alliance: "Solidarity Forever"
UKR_Fra_alliance_desc: "With Ukraine finally free from German capitalist oppression we can now freely decide our stance towards the international community.

We should ask France for an alliance."
UKR_Fra_claims: "Red Liberation"

UKR_RUS_friendship: "Northern Wind"
UKR_RUS_friendship_desc: "We didn't forget our brothers in the north. Though the traitors in 1918 tried to tear apart our ties with Russia the people of Ukraine did their best to restore them.

 UKR_shock_artillery_fire: "Shock Artillery Fire"
 UKR_shock_artillery_fire_desc: "Sometimes, using artillery fire is necessary not so much for defeating the enemy, as much as disorganising and discombobulating it. Effective campaign of such allows the enemy to show its weakness, which is why we should invest in artillery most effective in this department."
 UKR_army_research_bureau: "Establish the Army Research Bureau"
 UKR_army_research_bureau_desc: "As we march into the future, it becomes plainly obvious that new wars will rather be won using superior technology than any long-form trench warfare or “flood-wave” tactics.

 UKR_entrenchment_and_fortification_training_desc: "It is true that our nation’s borders are not particularly defendable.

 UKR_implement_48_hour_plan_desc: "Informally known as the “48-Hour Plan”, this plan exists as a contingency effort to make sure we can defend ourselves from a total onslaught in the event of a massive invasion (most likely from the East).

 UKR_deploy_new_fighter_prototypes_desc: "In recent years we’ve taken to developing our own Fighter designs, with some joint effort from our northern allies (primarily Germany). Our efforts have paid off, it seems. Testing has shown a very positive result. As such, we should deploy our newly developed aviation for mass production."
 UKR_commission_new_bomber_designs: "Commission Domestic Bomber Designs"
 UKR_commission_new_bomber_designs_desc: "Bombers have been shown to be very effective in disabling various elements of the war machine of any given warring nation. Whenever the next major European war comes, and it will, we must be ready. Depending on the designs utilized by our northern allies (primarily Germany) is all well and good, but it isn’t completely viable. As such, we must begin working on own designs."

 UKR_submarine_effort: "Wolves of the Euxine"
 UKR_submarine_effort_desc: "The submarine is vital to winning any war against a foe reliant upon trade. If their convoys are sunk, their men go without supplies - this will lead to an easy victory. We must ensure that the Black Sea acts for our enemies as little more than a dark watery grave."
 UKR_cruiser_effort: "Each Ship A Bulwark"
 UKR_cruiser_effort_desc: "Native dockyards in Odessa and Nikolayev are more than capable of producing large ships, such as cruisers. These will prove priceless in nearly every naval engagement."

Ukrainian Kings belong in Ukraine."

UKR_Clear_Marshes_Out_desc: "Stop children, what's that sound? Do you hear it too, up north in the Ruthenian Marshes? I still hear the stomp of German clad boots and the barbarous songs and flying colors of those imperialists. Come on, we shall cut their reign short."
UKR_Save_Mala_Rus: "Save 'Mala Rus'"
UKR_Save_Mala_Rus_desc: "Back in the times of the Tsar, Russians would always refer to us as little Russians, always putting forth the notion that we are underneath them. Well we shall beat back that notion, as we drive into their lands on a quest to liberate our kin who can’t speak their own language due to the ever watchful eye of Russian police units."

monsocukr.1.t: "A Bloody Red Morning"
monsocukr.1.d: "This morning at 8 sharp, King Vasyl I was shot and killed during his daily morning walk. Long preferring to walk alone without his usual accompaniment of guards, the fact something like this did not happen early is a bit shocking. The assassin, apprehended as soon as the shots were heard, was a member of the banned Communist Party of Ukraine, led by one Nikita Khrushchev, long an opponent of our regime. Despite this, the King's death could not come at a more opportune time. Although supportive of our reforms, the King had yet to fully embrace the rebirth of the revolution. With his death, Leo Stefan von Habsburg, not yet even a teenager, has been chosen by our government to replace the late King. Due to him still having years before he can fully take on his responsibilities, Leo Stefan, now King Lev II, is a perfect match, as he can be shown the truths of our ideals and policies. The Kingdom may mourn the death of her late King, but with his death comes a new dawn for the nation, under the dual rule of the Monarchy and the People's Government."
monsocukr.1.a: "The King is dead, Long Live the King!"

monsocukr.2.t: "The Case of the Khrushchevites"
monsocukr.2.d: "After months of preparation, the trial of Khrushchev, his closest allies, and his entire party apparatus has finally begun. Charged with conspiracy to assassinate the late King, the trial is a forgone conclusion. While all will get a chance to speak, present evidence and defend themselves, all know that  the Khrushchevites are doomed to swing.\n\nThe trial itself was a simple affair, and hearkened back to the various show trials that the Bolsheviks carried out in the final days of the Soviet uprising.  Each and every man was convicted of treason, with the rope waiting for Khrushchev and others. What's more, the KMS has been formally banned, it's assets seized and turned over to the People's Government. While this was a small step, it is a necessary one, for to truly revitalize the nation, the rot must be purged out."
monsocukr.2.a: "So long you bastard. Good riddance."

monsocukr.3.t: "An Alliance for the Future of Ukraine"
monsocukr.3.d: "Of all the various political factions we find ourselves competing against within Ukraine, the National-Syndicalists, under the control of Oleksander Shumsky, are the closest to us in terms of policy. Wishing to build a syndicalist state within a revived Ukraine is the gist of the their policy, and the similarities between our own program is quite striking. Seeing as how we both find ourselves adrift in a sea of hostile ideologies, it has been agreed that both of our parties should merge, allowing us to implement our programs all the easier. Mykhailo Yalovy, our foreign minister, is a personal friend of Shumsky, thus making the merger all the easier.\n\nThis merger is, of course, not just for convenience, it also allows us to keep a closer eye on Shumsky, as he is seen as a threat to our rule. Regardless, with the merger of our two parties, the future of Ukraine looks ever the brighter."
monsocukr.3.a: "Arm-in-arm, we work for the betterment of the nation."

monsocukr.4.t: "Reviving Ukrainian Culture"
monsocukr.4.d: "For the better part of modern history, Ukraine has been under the thumb of a foreign power. Be it the Russians, Poles, or Germans, we have had little to no chance for our culture to thrive. This has not been helped by period of Russifaction and other such attempts to strip our nation of it's uniqueness. This shall stand no longer! Under the people's government, our culture will thrive. Be it promotion of events featuring famous works of art, state sponsored food expos, or funding the arts in general, we shall not rest until Ukraine's culture is revived! While this may draw the ire of Russiphiles in the East and the Poles in the west, we know our cause is just. Ukraine shall be a phoenix from the ashes, rising to meet the culture challenges of the modern day."
monsocukr.4.a: "One step closer towards our goal."

monsocukr.5.t: "Against the Russian Menace"
monsocukr.5.d: "Of all the nations that have come to dominate our beloved homeland, none have been more horrid then that of the Russian bear.  Be it the subjaction of our people, the attempts to force us to become Russians or even the near-destruction of our culture, we have suffered more at the hands of the Russians then anyone else. No Longer! With a government that truly cares for the people finally in power within Ukraine, we shall reverse the table. Those Russians foolish enough to our lands shall be forced out, and driven back to 'Mother Russia.' Our Eastern lands shall be purified, and the same horror they inflicted on us will be inflicted upon them. When the time finally comes for us to stand against the Bear, we shall hold the line, for we know that a truly free Ukraine, by the People for the People, lives and dies with us!"
monsocukr.5.a: "Death to the Bear!"

monsocukr.6.t: "To Arms for Ukraine!"
monsocukr.6.d: "In the history of our great nation, figures such as Vladimir the Great stand out as true heros to the national cause, These figures are known to every true son of Ukraine, and their model still serves as perfect examples for our armed forces. Bohdan Khmelnytsky is one such man. Fighting against the oppressive rule of the Poles, Khmelnytsky's might established a free nation that we are the inheritors of such. In emulation of his legacy, and the government's own promotion of men such like him, various militias of peasants have formed, and have begun attacking and seizing land from Polish nobles that inhabit the west of our country. While these raids have been fairly tame, it cannot be said they don't show what a rallied up people can do. Within the sized lands, the former palaces of the landowning Poles have been transformed into massive schools, greatly increasing education within our rural population. What's more, the land sized has actually been handed over to government control by the people, giving us the chance to see it divided up correctly. With more raids planned or ongoing, it seems the people have finally found an outlet for years of oppression."
monsocukr.6.a: "A victory for the masses!"

monsocukr.7.t: "Terrorist Activity in Bessarabia!"
monsocukr.7.d: "Bessarabia has long been one of most contested areas of land, claimed  by both the Russians and Ukrainians, thus it is no surprise that both have hungrily eyed the land since the end of the Weltkrieg. While both have waited for a moment of weakness, waiting for us to slip up so they could size Bessarabia out from under us. It seems however, that this period of relative peace has ended. Over the course of the past few days, a string of terror attacks, carried out by what appears to be a contingent of Cossacks fighting what they claim is a 'modern day Yasir for the Ukrainian population in Bessarabia.'\n\nWhile we have no evidence besides hearsay, it is believed these Cossacks are agents of the 'Monarcho-Socialist' government in Kiev. Seemingly confirming this, Kiev has offered to subdue these terrorists, in exchange for 'temporary authority' over Bessarabia. In other words, they are demanding we hand over Bessarabia or the attacks will continue, if not all out war between our two nations. While such a war would no doubt be easily won, many within our government are calling for us to cave to Ukraine and to focus on reclaiming the rest of Greater Romania, saying we can always get the land back later. Whatever our choice, we must do something quickly, before even more lives are lost. "
monsocukr.7.a: "It will take more then terrorists for us to hand over our land!"
monsocukr.7.b: "Enough! The Ukrainians can have the land, it's not worth the human toll."

monsocukr.8.t: "Failure of Operation Muromets"
monsocukr.8.d: "Despite our best attempts, our convert efforts to get Romanian to hand over Bessarabia peacefully, also known as Operation Muromets, has failed. Despite having no direct evidence to link our government to the various terrorist attacks and cells that formed as a result of our actions, the Romanian government clearly seems to know it was us, and has issued a stern 'warning' that any attempts to restore order within Bessarabia by our troops would be seen as an act of war. While the Operation was clearly a failure, that doesn't mean we can't capitalize on the chaos that reigns in Bessarabia to quickly seize it from Romania will a small war. Regardless, the operation was a failure, and the only remaining avenue to capture the land is by war, if that war comes sooner or later remains to be seen however."
monsocukr.8.a: "Death to Romania! We march for Greater Ukraine!"
monsocukr.8.b: "They've won this round, we'll be back..."

monsocukr.9.t: "An Offer from the South"
monsocukr.9.d: "Much like ourselves, the government of Ukraine has recently taken a great leap forward, emerging as a predominant People's Government under the watchful eye of their King. Just like us, they have fallen adrift in a sea of conflicting ideologies and movements, however unlike when we first took up the mantle of the King and the People, a grouping of like minded nations exists, that of course being us and our Union of People's Crowns. Seeking to latch onto a nation that shares ideals, the Ukrainian Government has formally petitioned to join the Union of People's Crowns. Promising access to their vast grain resources, the Ukrainian delegation has promised that there is nothing to lose by granting them membership in the Union. Despite this, many wonder if they have alternative motives in this request, thus bringing their motivation for  joining into question."
monsocukr.9.a: "Of course! Long live the People's Crowns!"
monsocukr.9.b: "What has Ukraine ever done for us? Rejected!"

monsocukr.10.t: "A Disappointing Response"
monsocukr.10.d: "Much to our disappointment, the People's Government of White Ruthenia has denined our request to join the Union of People's Crowns. While unexpected, this is expected to have little effect on the nation overall. Despite this, we once again find ourselves alone, with our backs to the wall. May God protect the Union, for we cannot."
monsocukr.10.a: "A setback for sure, but one we can recover from."

monsocukr.11.t: "The East Ablaze" 
monsocukr.11.d: "As predicted, the Russians and Russophiles who inhabit the east of our nation have not taken kindly to our efforts to remove their perfidious influence. What started as a series of spontaneous protests against our anti-russian policies has turned into riots, and in the worst case, all out insurgency. While this violence has no chance of succeeding in anything more then property damage,  it is a sign of just how deep the Bear was able to sink it's claws into our nation. The armed forces are already preparing a plan to pacify the East; Those who rebel will be given two choices, return home and accept the righteous of the King and the People's Government, or be driven to Russia, where they can finally be united with the 'Motherland'. Those who resist even this most generous offer will face our full wrath, knowing what it means to face the People's justice. Either way, by the time we are done, Ukraine shall finally be free of the Russian Bear, after so long a time."
monsocukr.11.a: "Resistance is futile."
