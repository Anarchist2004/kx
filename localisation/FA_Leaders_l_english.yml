After it's defeat in the Russian Intervention Lessing moved to Germany where he attempted to spread the ideology of Lenin and incite a workers revolt. Chased out of Germany in 1935 by angry police officers, Lessing sought refuge in the Union of Britain, witch denied him entry on account of his support for Bolshevik groups within the UoB. Chased by the German police, Lessing fled Europe and began a journey that eventually lead him to the jungles of Rhodesia where he attempted to set up a Marxist-Leninist Society among the native population in a remote village."
POLITICS_DORISLESSING_DESC:0 "Doris was born in Kermanshah, Iran, on 22 October 1919, to Captain Alfred Tayler and Emily Maude Tayler, both British subjects. Her father, who had lost a leg during his service in World War I, met his future wife, a nurse, at the Royal Free Hospital in London where he was recovering from his amputation. The couple would leave Britain after the revolution and go to Iran, for Alfred to take a job as a clerk for the Imperial Bank of Persia. In 1925, the family moved to the British colony of Southern Rhodesia. As a girl Doris was educated first at the Dominican Convent High School, a Roman Catholic convent all-girls school in the Southern Rhodesian capital of Salisbury. She left school at age 13 and was self-educated from then on. She left home at 15 and worked as a nursemaid. She started reading material that her employer gave her on politics and sociology and began writing around this time. In 1937, Doris moved to London in the Union of Britain to pursue her writing career and socialist beliefs. She only just returned to her home of Rhodesia after it was liberated by the proletariat and its chains were broken."
POLITICS_GARFIELD_DESC:0 "Todd was born in Invercargill, New Zealand, in 1908. Todd emigrated to Southern Rhodesia from New Zealand in 1934 as a Protestant missionary and ran the Dadaya New Zealand Churches of Christ Mission school. Todd plans to introduce modest reforms aimed at improving the education of the black majority by taking tax-money paid by Rhodesian property owners and appropriations from the British colonial authorities, and directing it toward black schools. He has also devised a plan to give elementary education to every African of school age. Todd previously pushed a bill through the Legislative Assembly that would allow for multiracial trade unions in order to undercut the growing white nationalist influence in the unions."
POLITICS_HUGGINS_DESC:0 "Huggins was born in Bexley in north Kent, England on the 6th of July, 1883. After practising medicine and training as a surgeon in London, Huggins travelled to Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia in 1911 to act as a locum to some doctors there. He would return  to the UK in late 1914 following the outbreak of war and joined the Royal Army Medical Corps with the rank of Captain, stationed at Colchester Hospital which had become a casualty clearing station. Although he wanted to go to France he was sent to Malta where he dealt with incoming casualties from the Battle of Gallipoli. He returned to Southern Rhodesia at the end of the war and bought Craig Farm on the outskirts of Salisbury. He began again as a surgeon, quickly becoming the best known in Rhodesia. Though he was on the side of union with South Africa when there was a referendum on the matter, he has since accepted the Rhodesian decision to 'go it alone.'"
POLITICS_BOMBER_DESC:0 "Harris was born on 13 April 1892, at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, where his parents were staying while his father George Travers Harris was on home leave from the Indian Civil Service. With his father in India most of the time, Harris grew up without a sense of solid roots and belonging. Harris was educated at Allhallows School in Devon. A former Allhallows student, the actor Arthur Chudleigh often visited the school and gave the boys free tickets to his shows. Harris received such a ticket in 1909, and went to see the play during his summer holidays. The lead character in the show was a Rhodesian farmer who returned to England to wed, but ultimately fell out with his pompous fiancée and married the more practical housemaid instead. The idea of a country where one was judged on ability rather than class was very inspiring to the adventurous Harris, who promptly told his father that he intended to emigrate to Southern Rhodesia instead of going back to Allhallows for the new term and would arrive in Rhodesia in 1910. When the First World War broke out in August 1914, Harris did not learn of it for nearly a month, being out in the bush at the time. Despite his previous reluctance to follow the path his father had had in mind for him in the army, and his desire to set up his own ranch in Rhodesia, Harris felt patriotically compelled to join the war effort. In October 1915, after unsuccessfully attempting to find a position in first the cavalry, then the Royal Artillery, Harris joined the Royal Flying Corps and would learn to fly later that year. Harris remained in the newly formed Royal Air Force following the end of the First World War, but would return to Rhodesia after the defeat of the government by the syndicalist forces."
POLITICS_FIELD_DESC:0 "Winston Field was born on 13 April 1892, in Bromsgrove in Worcestershire, England. He would move to Southern Rhodesia in the 20's and become a tobacco farmer. After the fall of Britain to Syndicalisim, he became a committed anti-syndicalist and a powerful voice in the British-dominated areas of the Federation, namely Rhodesia. Now he has been elected to lead Rhodesia through her first of many challenges, unto the bright and early dawn."
POLITICS_BADEN_DESC:0 "Baden-Powell was born as Robert Stephenson Smyth Powell at 6 Stanhope Street, Paddington in London, on 22 February 1857. After having been educated at Charterhouse School in Surrey, Baden-Powell served in the British Army from 1876 until 1910 in India and Africa. In 1899, during the Second Boer War in South Africa, Baden-Powell successfully defended the town in the Siege of Mafeking. During the final year Weltkreig Powell was appointed supreme commander of British Africa in order to boost failing British Morale. After the war's end he was offered a role in both the Canadian and South African militaries witch he turned down in favor of retirement in German occupied Rhodesia from where he coordinated with many nations in order to promulgate the Boy Scouts program. Powell Despises Syndicalisits for destroying his beloved Empire, and has been called to lead a free, British Rhodesia in this hour of need. With the hero of the Matabele war on their side Rhodesians are ready to reclaim lost glory."
POLITICS_BURKE_DESC:0 "There is something almost tragic about the life of Desmond Lardner-Burke, it's probably why he's such an intractable individual today. Born in the Cape of Good Hope in 1909, young Burke aspired to be a lawyer but fate wouldn't have it that way. Burke was only a young boy when word returned home that many of his brothers were slaughtered by the German Imperial Forces in East Africa, this set off a chain reaction that would come to define Burke for the rest of his life. When the empire collapsed in 1925, the legacy of Cecil Rhodes died with it, this fact coincided with the death of his brothers by German hands, fueled a furious anger inside Burke, one that would never cease. Burke became active in politics soon after and helped form a grand coalition of Pro-British and Far-Right factions dubbed the "Rhodesian Front", which would rise in popularity during the 20s and early 30s. Burke would be the face of this movement, becoming known as a young radical in a sea of old politicians, he would use this popularity to get several of his ideological points to the masses and subsequently entrench them in the Rhodesian Front. After allying with the United Federal Party and seizing power after the 1937 Constitutional election, Burke now resides over a nation as shattered and broken as he once was, but Burke will rebuild Rhodesia into his image and stand up to the Hunnic Menace, by any means necessary."

POLITICS_STANLEY_MATHENGE_DESC:0 "When Mathenge brutally eliminated his rivals for power within Kinyaa, he had no intention of slowing down or stopping there. Now that he is in power, he has plans for his people. With the European imperialists largely out of the picture, Mathenge believes it is time to give the formerly stolen land back to the native populations, who will farm it and tend to it as their ancestors did. For Mathenge, it is more than just revering the traditions of our ancestors; we must also ensure the dominance of the Kikuyus in our part of the continent. To do so, he believes we should bring our weaker neigbhors into the fold in order to create a united front against any European who tries to take back this land. Equally as important as this, it is crucial that the influence of European culture and faith is wiped from Africa, and this will be done through force if necessary. Mathenge, though presenting a tough image to the world, only wishes to see his people prosper as they did before the meddlesome hands of outsiders forced their way into the lives of the Kikuyu people. With enough resources at his disposal, and the will to bring the nation into the Modern Era industrially and militarily, he could very well see this desire come to fruition..."
POLITICS_DEDAN_KIMATHI_DESC:0 "Dedan Kimathi, at only eighteen years old, has beaten his rivals to become the leader of Kinyaa. He has created legitimacy for himself by taking the son of his mentor and former leader, Hussein Obama, into his own care. Now, serving as regent for the young Obama, Kimathi has had no problem articulating his vision to his people. For Kimathi, the implementation of socialism in the nation's agrarian sector is key to seeing its farmers prosper. Meanwhile, Kimathi does not look as unfavorably towards Europeans as his fellow revolutionaries have; as long as they are aligned with the Third Internationale, Kimathi does not care. Instead, he hopes to model his new state partly off of their example and partly off his own beliefs, which entail local democracy for his people and unity among Kenyans. To guarantee the continued existence of his new fragile state, Kimathi has expressed a desire for a strong military and industrial sector alike. With the ability to fend off invaders, both inwardly and from across the ocean, Kimathi can focus on building a strong state for his people."
