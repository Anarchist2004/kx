### Leaders ###
# Mahidol Line
POLITICS_RAMA_VII_DESC: "Prajadhipok, also known by his regnal name Rama VII, was enthroned as King of Siam upon the death of his brother in 1925. Unprepared for kingship, having previously been far down the order of succession, he is essentially a puppet of the Supreme Council of State run by his cousins. Educated abroad and commissioned in the British Army, Prajadhipok nonetheless genuinely cares for his people and works diligently to improve his subjects' lot." # Prajadhipok
POLITICS_RAMA_VIII_DESC: "Ananda Mahidol, known by his regnal name Rama VIII, has ascended to the Siamese throne following the death of his uncle, Rama VII. Ananda Mahidol was once considered a very unlikely candidate for the throne, being barely a teenager and of low birth. He originally held the rank of 'Mom Chao', making him among the lowest of Siamese princes. Despite his youth and inexperience, he has quickly won the hearts of the Siamese people. Foreign observers, however, believe that he did not really want to be king that his reign would not last long. " # Ananda Mahidol
POLITICS_RAMA_VIX_DESC: "Bhumibol Adulyadej, known by his regnal name Rama IX has ascended to the Siamese throne following the mysterious death of his late brother, Rama VIII. Bhumibol Adulyadej has so far proven himself much more politically competent than his late brother, navigating the convoluted Siamese political landscape with seeming ease. Many speak of Bhumibol Adulyadej as the savior of the once embattled Siamese monarchy" # Bhumibol Adulyadej
# Paribatra Line
POLITICS_SUKHUMBHAND_DESC: "Paribatra Sukhumbhand, cousin to expected successor to the Siamese throne Ananda Mahidol, has seized control of the Siamese government, citing Ananda's inexperience and his age. With the full support of the Privy Council he has crowned himself as King Rama VIII, firmly establishing the Boripatr cadet branch as the new ruling house." # Paribatra Sukhumbhand
POLITICS_CHUMBHOTBONGS_PARIBATRA_DESC: "Chumbhotbongs Paribatra, known by his regnal name Rama IX, has succeeded his father, Rama VIII, to the throne of Siam. Chumbhotbongs Paribatra is something of a recluse, but still politically competent. He is a known patron of the arts, having converted multiple state-owned properties into museums, and has personally sponsored many great artists both in Siam and abroad." # Chumbhotbongs Paribatra
POLITICS_SUKHUMABHININDA_DESC: "Sukhumbhinanda, son of former King Paribatra Sukhumbhand (Rama VIII) and a lowborn woman, was legitimised by his brother King Rama IX due to the latter's inability to produce a male heir. He has ascended to the throne as Rama X. Sukhumbhinanda is a prominent philanthropist whose efforts to relieve Bangkok's poorest have garnered him much publicity. With Sukhumbhinanda's ascension much of the remaining public discontent with the monarchy has dissipated."
# Chrakrabongse Line
POLITICS_CHULA_CHAKRABONGSE_DESC: "Chula Chakrabongse, the half-Ukrainian grandson of King Rama V, has been installed as king of Siam. Chula Chakrabongse lived an eccentric life of leisure in Britain and later Austria before becoming king, and has delegated nearly all of his royal duties in favour of his passion for both horse and automobile racing."
# Left
POLITICS_SONG_NOPPAKUL_DESC: "Song Noppakul, also known by his real name Prasong Wongwiwat and 'Comrade Ba', is a Siamese-Chinese man who co-founded the underground Syndicalist movement within Siam. Following the death of Pichit na Sukothai he became its de-facto leader."# Song Noppakul the Totalist
POLITICS_PRIDI_PANOMYONG_DESC: "Pridi Phanomyong, also known by his ministerial title 'Luang Praditmanutham', immediately set out to better the lives of the Siamese people upon his appointment as a minister. His controversial 'Yellow Cover Dossier' outlined his political and economic reform agenda and divided the Siamese government, but the controversy only served to further Pridi's political career." # Pridi Phanomyong at the onset of the CW
POLITICS_PRIDI_PANOMYONG_REBEL_WIN_DESC: "Pridi Phanmoyong, previously known by his ministerial title Luang Praditmanutham, has become the Chairman of the Sapha Prachachon following a brief but bloodly Siamese Civil War. Panomyong's policies of economic nationalisation and radical parliamentarian reform may now continue, however challenges from more radical elements within Pridi's Sahachip Party have grown significannotly. Despite his popularity, Panomyong struggles to maintain his authority even with his allies in the Navy." # Pridi Phanomyong after winning his rebellion
# Right
POLITICS_PLAEK_KHITTASANGKHA_DESC: "Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, more popularly known as 'Chormpon Por' by thelocals and 'Phibun' in the West, the one-time ally of Pridi Phanmoyong and the People's Party has seized power following the Yellow Cover Dossier Affair. Together with Luang Wichitwathakarn and his allies in the military he has built his own cult of personality to sideline the Monarchy. He views the current state of Siam as an 'outdated relic of a bygone era' and intends to use his power to promote militarism and nationalism, proclaiming both to be additional essential principles of the modern nation." # Plaek Phibunsongkhram after Coup d’état
POLITICS_PHAO_SRIYANOND_DESC: "Police Chief Phao Sriyanond has succeeded Plaek Phibunsongkhram as leader of Siam's military regime with the support of the Soi Ratchakhru Clique. Phao is known for his brutality and political cunning, and his political opponents tend to 'disappear'. Phao also believes the Siamese monarchy to be an antiquated relic which impairs the cause of nationalism, and is thus an avowed Republican" # Phao Sriyanond
POLITICS_SARIT_THANARAT_DESC: "General Sarit Thanarat has succeeded Plaek Phibunsongkhram as leader of Siam's military regime with the support of the Sisao Thawaet Clique. Originally a lowly officer in the Phayap Army, he quickly rose through the ranks with Plaek and Phin's help. An ardent anti-Syndicalist, he views the Monarchy as an important tool against the reds and as the focal point of Thai Nationalism." # Sarit Thanarat
# Republic
POLITICS_THAWAN_THAMRONGNAWASAWAT_DESC: "Nicknamed the 'Golden-Tongue Statesman', Thawan is renowned for his public speaking and debating skills, which he fully exploit for his coalition building. As a champion of the grassroots, the ex-Admiral favours policies which helps the common people, such as price ceiling for household commodities and expansion of public welfare. However, these policies also put him at odds with the capitalists and the burgeoning Thai-Chinese middle class who are burdened with greater taxes."
POLITICS_POTE_SARASIN_DESC: "A Thai-Chinese from upper middle class background, Pote Sarasin's experience in the Ministry of Finance during the Black Monday has shaped his worldview. As fan of the Austrian economist Hayek and a strict adherance to the law, he is against the expansion of state-owned enterprises while trying to ensures the fair, free and open competition. Another policy of his being the expansion of higher education across the nation as a mean to reinvigorate the recovering local industries."
POLITICS_KUEKRIT_PRAMOJ_DESC: "As a member of a cadet branch of the Chakri Dynasty with Chinese ancestry, Kuekrit may appears as an odd choice of leader for republican Siamese state. Inspite of that, this 'Young Viper' manages to gather enough political clout among the many conservative circles with his own political shrewdness rather than his familial connection to gain a working majority for the new government to function properly. His policy of 'Ngoen Phan'(Money Fluctuation) help keeps the rural area happy and secured from the Syndicalist hands. Whether if he only pay lip services to the republican causes, however, remain to be seen..."

siam.13.d: "King Prajadhipok of the [SIA.GetName], also known as Rama VII—the 7th monarch of the House of Chakri—has died this morning due to a heart failure. The childless monarch will be succeeded by his nephew, Ananda Mahidol, who has taken the regnal name Rama VIII."
siam.13.d.plaek: "King Prajadhipok of the [SIA.GetName], also known as Rama VII—the 7th monarch of the House of Chakri—has died this morning due to pneumonia during his time in exile. The childless monarch will be succeeded by his nephew Ananda Mahidol, who has taken on the regnal name Rama VIII."
siam.13.d.rep: "Prajadhipok Sakdidej na Ayutthaya, formerly King Prajadhipok of the [SIA.GetName], also known as Rama VII—the 7th monarch of the House of Chakri—has died this morning due to pneumonia during his time in exile.

siam.13.a: "May he rest in peace."

siam.14.t: "Paribatra Sukhumbhand's Scheme" # Boripatr (?)
siam.14.d: "The new king is still young and currently away from home, studying in Switzerland. Should we take the initiative and quickly seize the throne and title of King of [SIA.GetSIAshortname] for ourselves? After all, we can't count on him to lead us through the war."
siam.14.a: "The throne is vacant for us."
siam.14.b: "We should stay true to the rightful king."

siam.15.t: "The Death of Rama VIII" # Mahidol
siam.15.d: "King Ananda Mahidol of the [SIA.GetName], also known as Rama VIII—the 8th monarch of the House of Chakri—was found in his bed, shot dead. Although at first thought to have been an accident his death was ruled a murder by medical examiners and three royal pages were later executed following irregular and rushed trials. The mysterious circumstances surrounding his death have been the subject of much controversy. The childless monarch will be succeeded by his brother Bhumibol Adulyadej, who has taken the regnal name Rama IX."
siam.15.d.plaek: "King Ananda Mahidol of the [SIA.GetName], also known as Rama VIII-the 8th monarch of the House of Chakri—has died from severe blood loss resulting from a severed radial artery after he crashed his car.

## Introduction Events ##
siamn.1.t: "The Kingdom of [SIA.GetSIAshortname] in 1936"
siamn.1.d: "One of the countries that benefited from German victory during the Weltkrieg, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] regained most of its former land which had previously been lost to the western imperialists. While [SIA.GetSIAshortname]'s relationship with the Huns is, in general, cordial, the fact that they thwarted her expansionist ambitions during the 1929 Intervention in Burma has strained diplomatic and military ties between the two. If [SIA.GetSIAshortname] should reconcile with the Germans or align itself with others powers is a matter to be decided in the coming decade."
siamn.1.a: "Interesting, tell me more!"
siamn.1.b: "I've a good grasp of the general situation."

siamn.2.t: "The State of Politics"
siamn.2.d: "Ever since the coronation of King Rama VII in 1925 most, if not all, of the policies set forth within [SIA.GetSIAshortname] have been dictated by the Aphiratthamontri Sapha (Supreme Council of State). This is a council made up of the King's older siblings, who have continually worked to consolidate their power while keeping the power of the king over the nation weak. Despite promising the [SIA.GetAdjective] intelligentsia that a codified constitution would be issued any reform has been tough to pass, as it would be against the interests of the nobility.\n\nSurrounded by enemies, such as the Konbaung dynasty to the west, Yunnanese bandits to the north, and the German imperialists to the east, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] is in a dire situation. It will either perish, forever confined to the pages of a history book, or shall reform itself and emerge a modern state, be it by negotiation or through the use of force."
siamn.2.a: "I pity the poor king..."

siamn.3.t: "The Kingdom's Many Other Problems"
siamn.3.d: "While seemingly economically and industrially prosperous to outside eyes, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] is actually very reliant on investments made by Germany and must cherish the economic ties it shares with the nation. Industry is a very fragile and small section of the economy, which is mainly built around rice, sugar, and timber exports. Nationalism among ethnic minorities has been rising, which raises the spectre of separatist movements in the near future. On top of all this: the bloated bureaucratic system, which has been present since the reign of Rama VI, has siphoned off much needed taxes and thus allowed for bandits to continually run wild in the fringes of [SIA.GetSIAshortname]."
siamn.3.a: "I'd rather pick the Philippines."

## Black Monday and Early political chaos # Max Reform 7 - Lowest 0: 0-2 = Khana Ratsadon coup, 3-4 = Civil War with Prajadhipok Bias (based on Boworadet Rebellion), 5-6 = success, 7 = Reactionary coup with Paribatra as HoS
siamn.4.t: "Black Monday hits [SIA.GetSIAshortname]!"
siamn.4.d: "Due to its heavy reliance on its economic ties with Germany Black Monday has quickly dragged [SIA.GetSIAshortname] into an economic abyss as demand for her main agricultural exports has fallen sharply and shipments have been left to wither in their warehouses. Clerks working for foreign companies are continually being laid off, while the people have begun to gather around the Grand Palace looking for hope. It is apparent that we must do something about our economic situation lest it worsen and send us spiraling further down."
siamn.4.a: "Khun Prah!"

siamn.5.t: "Jasmine Rice Problems"
siamn.5.d: "One of the largest exporters of rice within [SIA.GetSIAshortname], the farmers across the Chao Phraya, have asked for government intervention to deal with the excessive supply of rice due to a general fall in demand and fewer export opportunities after Black Monday."
siamn.5.a: "Purchase most of the rice to help stabilise the price." #-200, +2 reform
siamn.5.b: "Agree to buy up some excess rice." #-100, +1 reform
siamn.5.c: "The free market shall resolve the issue!" #0, 0 reform

siamn.6.t: "Bloated Bureaucracy"
siamn.6.d: "The modern bureaucratic system was formed during the reign of Rama V and had been greatly expanded by Rama VI. However, it has proved to be too large to effectively serve the state. Firing more people, however, would mean an increase in the unemployment rate at exactly the time when we want it to drop."
siamn.6.a: "Lay off a few of our clerks." # 0 reform
siamn.6.b: "Lay off managers and ministers." #-100, +1 reform
siamn.6.c: "Allow the status-quo for now." #-200, +2 reform

siamn.7.t: "Military Expenditure"
siamn.7.d: "[SIA.GetSIAshortname] currently spends up to 25% of her annual revenue on the preservation and maintenance of the military-industrial complex, as she is surrounded by both historical enemies and imperialistic westerners who desire her land. However perhaps slightly cutting our military expenditures wouldn't hurt us too much?"
siamn.7.a: "Cut any and all research funding." #-10 for 3 years, 0 reform
siamn.7.b: "Cut everything bar the development of new rifles." #-10 for 3 years, +1 reform
siamn.7.c: "We shouldn't show any weaknesses!" #-200, +2 reform

siamn.8.t: "Emergency Tax"
siamn.8.d: "Even though we've enacted many sweeping reforms we still do not have enough money to sufficiently balance this year's budget. An emergency tax should help remedy this situation, but will create more suffering for our loyal subjects."
siamn.8.a: "Increase the income tax rate!" #+50, 0 reform
siamn.8.b: "Double the inheritance tax!" #+10, +1 reform
siamn.8.c: "Lift the ban on gambling." #+30, -5 NP, +1 reform

## New Governmnet Established for Siam ##
siamn.10.t: "The Khana Ratsadon's Provisional Cabinet"
siamn.10.d: "Following the bloodless revolution we must rebuild the nation from the ground up. Luang Praditmanutham, head of the civilian faction of the provisional government and a prominent leftist, is now working on the creation of a formal constitution while others are beginning to educate the masses about the merits and workings of parliamentary democracy. Alongside all of this Phraya Phahonponpayuhasena has readied his troops, in case of an opportunistic invasion by foreign powers."
siamn.10.a: "This is a great leap forward for [SIA.GetSIAshortname]!"

siamn.11.t: "The Khanagummakarn Ratsadon's Provisional Cabinet"
siamn.11.d: "Following the ratification of the constitution the People's Committee, a group chosen by Prajadhipok himself, has begun the education of the masses in the ways of proper parliamentary democracy.\n\nHeaded by the [SIA.GetAdjective] Court, the Committee is also responsible for educational, health, and industrialisation reforms. The path ahead for [SIA.GetSIAshortname] will hardly be a stroll in the park but a bright future does await our great nation."
siamn.11.a: "This a great leap forward for the [SIA.GetAdjective] people!"

## Khana Ratsadon 1936 Election and subsequent Civil War ##

siamn.12.t: "The "Yellow Cover Dossier" Affair"
siamn.12.d: "Today Luang Praditmanutham, Minister of State and a member of the People's Party, presented the draft of his "National Economic Development Plan" proposal to the National Assembly.\n\nKnown as the "Yellow Cover Dossier" the plan details the formation of a welfare state, redistribution of land, state intervention in the private sector, and a system of subsidies for farmers.\n\nSome have compared the proposal to that of a syndicalist while others have agreed that the reforms will greatly improve the lives of the [SIA.GetAdjective] people.\n\nAll that remains is to see what his majesty has to say..."
siamn.12.a: "His Majesty agrees with Praditmanutham."
siamn.12.b: "His Majesty supports a watered down proposal."
siamn.12.c: "His Majesty demands the arrest of the syndicalist sympathiser!"

siamn.13.t: "Prajadhipok's Reply"
siamn.13.d: "King Prajadhipok's reply has arrived and is heavily critical of Luang Praditmanutham's draft, going so far as to accuse Praditmanutham of being a syndicalist! An emergency session of the chief members of the People's Party has lead to the party deciding to..."
siamn.13.a: "...back down for the moment."
siamn.13.b: "...file a lawsuit against the King."

siamn.14.t: "Domestic Tensions"
siamn.14.d: "Thawan Ritthidet, a private citizen, has recently filed a lawsuit against the King; accusing him of intervention in political, state, and economic affairs. The fallout over Luang Praditmanutham's plan has further divided the cabinet and has pitted the Royalists and the Parliamentarians against each other."
siamn.14.a: "Reconcilation is in order, it seems."
siamn.14.b: "Arrest those Syndicalists!"

siamn.15.t: "Luang Phibunsongkhram's Dilemma"
siamn.15.d: "A political crisis is currently ongoing and has nearly reached the boiling point! Tensions are high and it is clear that we must take steps to remedy the situation. What shall we do?"
siamn.15.a: "It's treason then! (Side with the Parliamentarians)"
siamn.15.b: "HM's dignity must be upheld! (Side with the Royalists)"
siamn.15.c: "Try to end this factional bickering."

siamn.16.t: "Dawn of the [SIA.GetAdjective] Civil War"
siamn.16.prd: "Despite the chief of the armed forces declaring his allegiance to the monarchy, a small mutiny in Sattahip and Kanchanaburi by the navy has quickly grown out of control and has now engulfed the entire nation in chaos."
siamn.16.ppd: "Despite the chief of the armed forces declaring his allegiance to the new cabinet, a small mutiny in Lopburi and Nakhon Ratchasima by the army has quickly grown out of control and has now engulfed the entire nation in chaos."

siamn.17.b: "Surrender (to Parliamentarians)"

siamn.18.t: "The Reclamation of Bangkok"
siamn.18.d: "The [SIA.GetAdjective] Civil War has recently taken an unexpected turn for the better, as our side has managed to reclaim Bangkok. Perhaps the government will come to their senses finally surrender?"
siamn.18.a: "Issue an ultimatum."
siamn.18.b: "To the death!"

siamn.19.t: "The Government's Reply"
siamn.19.d.yes: "While some ministers in the illegitimate government have fled abroad, the remainder have complied with our demands and have promptly laid down their arms."

siamn.24.prd: "After the reclamation of our eastern and southern regions by government forces the remaining revolutionaries have decided to flee to German Malaya, where we must contend with extradtion proceedures. It is more important to first mourn the losses sustained during the war by our loyal subjects. A countrywide public funeral has been held, with the remains of our loyal subjects carried through Ratchadamnoen road to Sanam Luang where King Prajadhipok has given us permission to set up a public funeral pyre on the sacred royal cremation ground."
siamn.24.ppd: "After subduing the majority of the seperatists and rebels we have received word that the remaining rebels have fled to Yunnan. No matter, for we shall catch what remains of the rebel scum later. We must first mourn the losses sustained by our loyal men, to that end the royal cremation ground has been converted into a public pyre. Prajadhipok, who was largely unrelated to the rebellion, has been permitted to return to the Grand Palace."

## Industrial Nationalizaion ##

siamn.26.t: "The Question of German-Owned Factories"
siamn.26.d: "Prominent German businesses within the [SIA.GetName] are mostly linked to the shipping, logging and railway industries. A large loan on good terms from the government might easily convince them to kick-start their operations again, though we could simply seize their factories as well. Doing so, however, could mean economic suicide for the [SIA.GetName]. How should we approach the situation?"
siamn.26.a: "Seize the means of production!."
siamn.26.b: "Offer monetary compensation."
siamn.26.c: "Let's look elsewhere..."

siamn.27.t: "[SIA.GetSIAshortname] Seizes Our Factories!"
siamn.27.d.bast: "The new [SIA.GetAdjective] government has begun their 'Industrial Nationalisaton' programme in order to help strengthen their economy. Our factories in the [SIA.GetName] have been wrongfully seized by the military junta of Premier Plaek Phibunsongkhram."

siamn.27.a: "Those bastards!"
siamn.27.b: "At least they've given us compensation."

siamn.28.t: "The Question of American-Owned Factories"
siamn.28.d: "The American car company, Ford, have their South-East Asian operations based here in Ayutthaya. Due to political and economic strife in the States it is unlikely that the United States would retaliate if we were to seize the factory. What shall we do?"

siamn.29.t: "The Question of Canadian-Owned Rubber Plantations"
siamn.29.d: "With the British in South-East Asia forced to retreat to Australasia following the British Revolution, many private rubber plantations in Sirat Malai have been left deserted for some time by their former owners. While we could simply seize the plantations, doing so would upset the Australasians who are a major naval power in the Asia-Pacific region and, potentially, allies. What shall we do?"

siamn.30.t: "The Question of Japanese-Owned Iron Mines"
siamn.30.d: "The Japanese own a few iron mines in Yala and Nakhon Si Thammarat which are used to transfer key raw materials to their home islands. While we could potentially seize the mines doing so would alienate us and permanently damage [SIA.GetAdjective]-Japanese relations, leaving us without a powerful ally to help challenge the German hegemony in the region. What shall we do?"

siamn.31.t: "Phibunsongkhram Criticised For Weak Foreign Policy"
siamn.31.d: "Due to the National Industrialisation Scheme bringing about little to no economic change our opponents in the media and political arena alike have accused us of weak and ineffective leadership."
siamn.31.a: "Damn it!"

## Siamese- Burmese War (NatPop) ##

siamn.32.t: "Burmese Agitators Captured"
siamn.32.d: "Eleven Burmese agitators in Morlamaeng, one of the Mon majority cities near the Salween River delta, were caught today spreading pamphlets which bore the slogan 'Liberation From The [SIA.GetAdjective] Yoke'. Perhaps we can take advantage of this event to help rally support for our regime and finish off the Burmese threat once and for all!"
siamn.32.a: "Who said we were cowards?"
siamn.32.b: "A chance to show them who's boss!"
siamn.32.c: "We aren't ready for that right now..."

siamn.33.t: "[SIA.GetNameDefCap] Has Declared War!"
siamn.33.d: "Bad news! Apparently the [SIA.GetAdjective] have caught eleven "Burmese spies", despite them being in what is rightfully our territory. Their army is now advancing towards Yangon. This is outrageous!"
siamn.33.a: "To arms, citizens!"

siamn.34.t: "Treaty of Thawai" # Siamese Wins
siamn.34.d: "The decadent Burmese in Yangon have been routed and our forces are securely entrenched in the smouldering remains of their capital. Now is the best time to demand concessions from the Burmese government, victory is ours. The question is: should we seek peace or continue fighting the war until we've rid ourselves of the Burmese forever?"

siamn.37.d: "The decadent [SIA.GetAdjective] in Bangkok have been routed and our forces are securely entrenched in the smouldering remains of Chiang Mai. Now is the best time to demand concessions from the [SIA.GetAdjective] government, victory is ours. The question is: should we seek peace or continue fighting the war until we've rid ourselves of the [SIA.GetAdjective]?"

## Phibunsongkhram's Ratthaniyom Reform, Assassination attempt and its aftermath ##
siamn.40.t: "Implementing The Ratthaniyom Reforms"
siamn.40.d: "The Ratthaniyom, or "Popular State", reforms were proposed by the nationalists as a means to reach the ultimate goal of a strong nation which favour of the Thai people. However, this may result in some unwanted friction with the Malays, Chinese, Mons, and Cambodians living within our nation."
siamn.40.a: "Who cares? Implement the reforms."
siamn.40.b: "On the second thought, this is probably a bad idea."

siamn.41.t: "Changing Siam's Name?"
siamn.41.d: "While our country has been known as Siam since the late Ayutthaya era, intelligence within the [SIA.GetAdjective] community have pointed out that, since our nation is mostly made up by Thais, it would make sense to change our name to Pratet Thai, or Thailand, in order to reflect that fact. However, the could antagonise the minorities in our nation. What shall we do?"
siamn.41.a: "We shall be a nation of the Thai people!"
siamn.41.b: "We shall remain as Siam!"

siamn.42.t: "The Tai Merger and New National Anthem Act"
siamn.42.d: "Following the passage of the law which has officially made us Thailand, the use of use of Tai Lao, Tai Dam, Tai Daeng, Tai Puan, Tai Yai, Tai Sayam, Tai Khuean, Tai Lue, Tai Yuan and others in the Tai Kadai cultural group are now simply known as Thais. Minorities will retain the Thai prefix as they are, as mandated by law, also Thais. The national anthem shall also be changed to reflect this new reality, with a competition set to occur in thirty days to help decide the new anthem."
siamn.42.a: "Pass it!"
siamn.42.b: "Rather not."

siamn.43.t: "[GetYear] National Language and Compulsory Education Act"
siamn.43.d: "To further our policy of Thaification, or the integration of the minorities into Thailand, the central Thai dialect (the Bangkokian dialect) has now been designated the primary language, with northern Thai and Laotian dialects banned. The new law shall make the teaching of the central Thai dialect compulsory and will negatively affect ethnic and religious schools, such as Chinese-run schools, Catholic Assumption Colleges and Pornor Muslim Schools in the south, unless they agree to comply with the new law. Of course, we could also be less forceful in our implementation of the law or cancel the passage of it entirely."
siamn.43.a: "Thaification is the way forward!"
siamn.43.b: "Let us simply promote the use of the Bangkokian dialect."
siamn.43.c: "Cancel the passage of the law..."

siamn.44.t: "Foreigner Workforce Exclusion Act"
siamn.44.d: "Due to the recent influx of Chinese immigrants–who had escaped the carnage and destruction of the Chinese Civil War–into [SIA.GetName], we have seen an increase in the unemployment rate. In order to tackle this problem, the government has decided to declare select jobs as off-limits to unskilled immigrants and set them aside for our own people. This will, however, have negatively impact on our economy due to our reliance on Chinese labour."
siamn.44.a: "We must preserve the [SIA.GetAdjective] market!"
siamn.44.b: "We need the foreign labour; cancel the act!"

siamn.45.t: "Completion of the Ratthaniyom Reforms"
siamn.45.d: "All of the major laws regarding Phibunsongkhram's Ratthaniyom reforms have now been successfully implemented, in one way or another. We now eagerly await the public reaction to the news reforms."

SIA_agrarianscoop: "Agricultural Co-operatives"
SIA_agrarianscoop_desc: "While the first [SIA.GetAdjective] co-op was created back in 1916, co-ops themselves aren't a common sight among rural communities yet. By persuading rice farmers to pool their savings together and organize into co-ops they will have enough money to buy the badly needed farming equipment in these hard times, and obtain greater bargaining power against the rice merchants."
SIA_communalapproach: "A Communal Approach"
SIA_communalapproach_desc: "Rice is central to [SIA.GetAdjective] society. Our farmers have long resisted to government intervention and embraced egalitarian methods, exchanging labour with other farmers to cover their needs. By focusing on these aspects of [SIA.GetAdjective] society and encouraging further community cooperation we can build a better country, while guarding against aristocrats and landlords."

SIA_selfsufficiencyeconomics_desc: "Our plans to boost rice cultivation have worked incredibly well so far, and a dizzying amount agricultural surplus is available. We can now fully focus on our industrialisation plan."
SIA_exportrice: "Export-Oriented Rice Production"
SIA_exportrice_desc: "Rice is central to [SIA.GetAdjective] society. Rice production normally does not ammount to much more than the farmer needs to survive, leaving very little to profit from. If necessary we can colaborate with large rice merchants and mills to supply a market pressure for more production, or we can simply obligate the farmers to produce more by increasing their rice tax."
SIA_ricesubsidyscheme: "Rice Subsidy Scheme"
SIA_ricesubsidyscheme_desc: "By creating incentives for those farmers who have accomplished huge increases in their rice output and allowing peasants to own the land they've cleared for agricultural purposes we can provide simple market incentives to cultivate more land and increase crop yields."
SIA_worldgranary: "Granary of the World"
SIA_worldgranary_desc: "We're now one of the largest rice exporters in the world, even if the peasantry do feel a touch exploited."

SIA_nationalhighway_desc: "The expansion of Route 3 (Sukhumvit Road: Bangkok - Rayong) and Route 1 (Vachiravut Road: Bangkok - Lopburi) has been considered by the government for some time now - with the creation of the National Highway Commission perhaps things will progress more smoothly."
SIA_railwaygauge: "Standardisation of the Railway Gauge"
SIA_railwaygauge_desc: "Owing to the different standards of foreign nations and extractive purpose of [SIA.GetName]'s railroads, our rolling stock is different from province to province.

### Army Path ###
SIA_royalsiamesearmy: "[SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetAdjective] Army"
SIA_royalsiamesearmy_desc: "First formed in 1874, as a response to new security threats brought in by the 1855 Bowing treaty (which opened us to international trade) - the army is the oldest and largest branch in the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetAdjective] Armed Forces, fulfilling its role as the protector of our sovereignty."
SIA_phibunsongkhramplan: "Phibunsongkhram's Reforms"
SIA_phibunsongkhramplan_desc: "The [SIA.GetName] will adopt a doctrine based on the advice of Luang Phibunsongkhram. Being well known for his translation of a French Weltkrieg-era Field Artillery manual into Thai, he advocates for a centralized and well-equiped army with the usage of artillery being the main focus."
SIA_seriroengritplan: "Seriroengrit's Reforms"
SIA_seriroengritplan_desc: "The [SIA.GetName] will follow the advice of Luang Seriroengrit, the leader of the Phayap Army who fought off numerous cross-border raids from Burma post-British Revolution. His doctrine emphasizes the usage of a decentralized regional army command, composed mainly by militias. Similar to that of Switzerland."
SIA_phrayaphahonplan: "Phahonpolpayuhasena's Plan"
SIA_phrayaphahonplan_desc: "The [SIA.GetName] will adopt the proposals of Phraya Phahonpolpayuhasena. Studies at the Hauptkadettenanstalt during his younger years and experience of the German General Staff's work during the Weltkrieg have convinced him that proper planning is the key to victoy."
SIA_jungletraining: "Jungle Combat Training"
SIA_jungletraining_desc: "The harsh jungles of Indochina have long been a graveyard of empires, friend and foe alike. We must train all our troops to better operate in such hostile conditions."
SIA_femalecorps: "Suranaree Battalion"
SIA_femalecorps_desc: "While 'Ja-Khlone', female palace guards, have been a common sight in the inner palace since the Ayutthayan era having female soldiers in active combat is on another level altogether. Luang Phibunsongkhram himself has voiced limited support for the petition, but the question is still up in the air. Persuing such measures is sure to anger traditionalists."
SIA_asymmetricalwarfare: "Asymmetrical Warfare"
SIA_asymmetricalwarfare_desc: "By analyzing the tactics employed by the Vietnamese in the Saigon Uprising -which quickly became the Indochinese Rebellion- and some of Luang Chumnanyutthasart's exploits in Shan back in 1928, we can gain some insight into effective placement of troops and how to fight in urban terrain."
SIA_newstandardrifle: "New Standard Rifle"
SIA_newstandardrifle_desc: "The old Type 46 Siamese Mauser is prone to malfunction in our hot and humid climate, perhaps it's time to get a replacement?"
SIA_artilleryresearchdivision: "Artillery Research Divisions"

SIA_armyaffairs: "Army Reorganisation"
SIA_armyaffairs_desc: "Our army currently uses various rifle and artillery models, which has proved to be a logistical nightmare. By adopting a unified ammunition size for each gun type and phasing the old ones out, or rechambering them to fire the new 8x52mmR Siamese rimmed catridge, we will considerably help our supply issues."
SIA_specialforce: "Special Warfare Command"
SIA_specialforce_desc: "Modelled after the German Luftlandetruppe and the Austrian Gebirgstruppe, 'Krom Songkhram Pisaet' will be responsbile for recruiting and training our new specialized units capable of disrupting the enemy from behind their lines."

SIA_taharpran_desc: "Also known as '[SIA.GetAdjective] Rangers' in English, Taharn Pran is a paramilitary light infantry unit of the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetAdjective] Army composed of volunteers who are trained to patrol the borders. They act as a quick response force in case of foreign invasion. Local volunteers also make sure that we aill always have the terrain advantage over the enemy."
SIA_royalmiltaryacademy: "Chulachomklao [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] Military Academy"
SIA_royalmiltaryacademy_desc: "By merging the Royal Military Academy (est. 1887) with the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetAdjective] Army Polytechniques Institute, the newly-named Chulachomklao [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] Military Academy should get better results as their funding will be streamlined and more efficient."
SIA_royalmunitionsfactory: "[SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] Munitions Factory"
SIA_royalmunitionsfactory_desc: "Having enemies on all sides, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] nearly used up all her artillery shells during the Weltkrieg, with no means of being freshly supplied. This has resulted in a massive supply of artilery shells being hoarded by the paranoid logistics department over the years, but additional ammunition factories would definitely help us in the event of prolonged conflict."
SIA_industrialmobilization: "Industrial Mobilisation Plan"
SIA_industrialmobilization_desc: "In the times of war, key industries will temporary be put under governemnt control to ensure our nation's survival. While this has proved to be unpopular, it will keep our army adequately armed and increase our chance of winning this war."

SIA_phaopoliceintegration_desc: "Police General Phao Sriyanond suggests that we should elevate the police force to the same level as the other 3 branches of the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetAdjective] Armed Forces.

SIA_nationalreserveact: "The National Reserve Act"
SIA_nationalreserveact_desc: ""...All men aged between 18-45 with [SIA.GetAdjective] citizenship are required to be registered at their local barracks and finish their basic trainig course at least once, not doing so can result in being court marshalled by the Army..."\n\n-excerpt from 2484 B.E. the National Reserve Bill"

### Navy Path ###
SIA_royalsiamesenavy: "[SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetAdjective] Navy"
SIA_royalsiamesenavy_desc: "Established in 1887, the [SIA.GetSIAnavyName] has similar organisational structures to the United States Navy, since it is composed of both the naval fleet and the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetAdjective] Marine Corps. It was also the second Asian nation to acquire submarines, after Japan."
SIA_expandmarinescorps: "Expand the Navikkayothin Corps"
SIA_expandmarinescorps_desc: "Although 'Taharn Ma-Rine' were first founded back in 1833, the unit served mostly as a royal honour guard throughout the 19th century. It wasn't until 1913 that the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetAdjective] Marine Corps were reorganized into the modern "Navy Amphibious Assault Group" who saw some action back in the Weltkrieg. Perhaps the marines can serve as yet another ace in the hole for the upcoming conflict?"
SIA_improvedlandingcraft: "Improved Landing Craft"
SIA_improvedlandingcraft_desc: "The [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetAdjective] Marine Corps currently use ex-British merchant ships we seized back in the Weltkreig as their only mean of transportation. Having dedicated amphibious landing ships will make sure that our boys can embark and secure the beachhead faster."
SIA_newflagship: "A New Flagship"
SIA_newflagship_desc: "As we are seriously outgunned by our neighbours having something that can reliably punch through battleship armour might be a good idea. This will also provide our seamen a sense of pride and accomplishment."
SIA_coastaldefenseships: "Coastal Defence Ships"
SIA_coastaldefenseships_desc: "While these heavily armed cruisers are no match against German East Asiaflotte or Imperial Japanese Navy, and have limited capability in the high seas, they will surely serve our cash-strapped navy well, especially in the island-dotted coastal waters of both the Gulf of [SIA.GetSIAshortname] and the Andaman Sea."
SIA_riverpatolunit: "River Patrol Units"
SIA_riverpatolunit_desc: "Both the Salween and Mekong rivers serve as our natural fortification against enemy advances. By sending our promising junior captains to learn from their brown water counterparts they can learn a lesson or two about naval organisation."
SIA_destroyerfleet: "Chonburi-Class Destroyers"
SIA_destroyerfleet_desc: "Named after late Admiral Prince Abhakara Kiartivongse, Prince of Chumphon, these new destroyer design will serve well as the backbone of our [SIA.GetSIAprefixTH]navi."
SIA_subships: "The S-Ships Project"
SIA_subships_desc: "These 'Ruea-Sor's were first envisioned by late Mahidol Adulyadej, Prince of Songkhla, who studied at the Marineschule Mürwik, as 'essential' to the defence of Bangkok and by extension the Gulf of [SIA.GetSIAshortname]. While we have procurred four small submarines for the first line of defence; continuing the second phase of the plan, which entails another 5 submarines for the outer defensive line, might be a good idea."
SIA_twooceannavy: "A Two-Ocean Navy"
SIA_twooceannavy_desc: "Our navy is perhaps too small to face the Kaiserliche Marine or the IJN head-on. Some additional funding would definitely help."
SIA_expandsattahip: "Expand Sattahip"
SIA_expandsattahip_desc: "Sattahip was first built as the [SIA.GetSIAnavyName]'s main naval base back in 1914. As the base is quite small and already reaching its support capacity limit, expansion of its facilities is definitely in order."
SIA_wolfpacks: "Convoy Hunting"
SIA_wolfpacks_desc: "Being surrounded by bigger and more heavily armed navy, Admiral Luang Yutthasart Kosol suggests we play hide-and-seek with the enemy fleet instead of facing them head-on. All the while sniping them from afar with our torpedoes."

SIA_royalsiameseaircorps_desc: "First founded in 1913 as the Royal Flying Corps, our flyboys have helped us achieve numerous victories by assisting us from the sky. We will therefore once again rename the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetAdjective] Aeronautical Service to the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetAdjective] Air Corps."

SIA_tacticalbombers: "Tactical Bomber Development"
