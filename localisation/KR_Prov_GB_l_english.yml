### Decs ##
BRG_pick_a_king:0 "The British Regency"
BRG_pick_a_king_desc:0 "Assembled at General Hobart's request, the Regency Council was formed will the sole propose to find and elect a new King for the British People. With the Windsors betraying every true blooded Briton when they fled to Canada, our possible pool of Kings and even a few Queens is quite large."

BRG_elect_wilhelm:0 "Elect the German Emperor"
BRG_elect_wilhelm_desc:0 "Ah Germany, the Global Hegemon, and our old enemy. While the history between our nations is storied and bloody, by electing the Kaiser we could put that behind us. Besides, the Entente would never risk a war with the Reichspact, thus the Kaiser would make for a very Monarch to protect our fair isles."

BRG_elect_romanov:0 "Elect the heir to the House of Romanov"
BRG_elect_romanov_desc:0 "The Romanovs, quite the strange option, but a viable one none the less. Despite losing power during the February Revolution, the honor of the Romanovs is unmatched. While never having ruled himself, Kirill is a noble man, and would make a fine King. Due to their blood relations with the Kaiser, a Romanov King could potentially see Britain in the Reichspact, if not an alliance with Russia herself, should the Empire be restored.

BRG_elect_frog:0 "Elect a Bourbon"
BRG_elect_frog_desc:0 "Despite not having ruled France for generations, the House of Bourbon still stands strong. While electing the claimant to one of our exiled enemies may seem strange, should the Nationalists in Algiers restore the Kingdom, we may be able to coax them into joining with us. If not, surly the Reichspact would accept us, if we offered to put down the Communards once and for all."

BRG_elect_bavarian:0 "Elect Rupprecht of Bavaria"
BRG_elect_bavarian_desc:0 "Rupprecht, King of Bavaria, loyal son of Germany, and Jacobite claimant to the English and Scottish thrones, is definitely not the first pick of the Regency. However, due to his German Kingship, meaning entrance into the Reichspact, along with his preexisting claims to Britain make him an appealing option none the less." 

BRG_elect_polock:0 "Elect Paweł Salwator 'Piast'"
BRG_elect_polock_desc:0 "An oddity among the claimants, Paweł Salwator 'Piast' as he calls himself, the self-proclaimed heir to the House of Piast, former ruling house of the Kingdom of Poland, was only seemingly brought before the Regency because he used to live in Liverpool. Due to the confusing status of both our own regency, along with that of Poland, Paweł, if elected, could potentially lead to an alliance with Poland. Although unlikely, we could also twist his story, and try to land ourselves in the Reichspact should Poland follow a different path."


### Events ###
basedbrit.1.t:0 "Consolidating Power"
basedbrit.1.d:0 "The tyrannical overreaches of the Maximists had been the final straw, before Hobart had ordered the divisions loyal to him to overthrow them. The trade unionists who had been in power and hiding before the Maximists had seen Hobart’s men besieging the Maximists offices and the execution of their officials, and so foolishly came out in crowds to celebrate the change of power, expecting it was to go back to them. Needless to say that London was bathed in the same red blood of syndicalists as the banners they had waved in naivety, thinking that Hobart would really give power back to those that had failed the same revolution they preached. Now those socialists who had survived those massacres against them are in hiding, undeniably bitter and shocked at how Hobart had cleansed the slate completely of them, despite them putting their trust in him that he had come along to their ideals. \n\nYet it was not only the socialists who were thrown aside in shame, but also the exiled Windsors in Canada, who had expected Hobart to clear the way and welcome them home in open arms. They were promptly given a slap to the face when Hobart issued a decree barring them from returning to the isles, for they had betrayed the British people when they had not only failed to stop the bloodshed between state and people during the revolution of ‘25, but also cowardly ran away from the home isles. Now Hobart is standing in a very precarious and dangerous situation, for socialists and those loyal to the windsors are most assuredly plotting in their hiding. However one way Hobart can bring about a new foundation for Britain would be to invite those who despite their love for Britain had been exiled to Canada, and thus can be accepted back home."
basedbrit.1.a:0 "Death to the Failed Revolution!"

basedbrit.2.t:0 "Return of The True Britons"
basedbrit.2.d:0 "While the revolution has been put down with the fist of Hobart, we cannot remain without support for too long before our precarious situation is brought down by popular uprising. Of course Hobart has already begun the process of accepting exiles back from Canada, particularly those who hold love for their isle and not any support for those Germans called the Windsors. Now there is as naturally expected some resistance to this and many of those stubborn conservatives remain alongside the Windsor king remain in Canada, however some political groups are willing to ditch the king and return home to join the process of creating a new system. \n\nThese two groups seeking to return home being those moderate members of the Labour party that went to Canada alongside the Exiles under Clement Atlee. There is also of course the much more nationalistic nordic following of Joyce, and the accompanying Right club under the head of Archibald Ramsey, who had converted to Catholicism in Canada due to his love and respect for the Pope’s supporters. \n\nNow Hobart must decide which group he will allow to join him in rebuilding Britain into a new and proper image. An image without that of the Windsors corrupting or destroying it."
basedbrit.2.a:0 "Work with the liberals of Atlee"
basedbrit.2.b:0 "Work with the Nationalist groups"

basedbrit.4.t:0 "Republican Britain is back"
basedbrit.4.d:0 "The Labour party has returned to Britain and has now fully reintegrated itself into British society. Despite their relatively short time since arrival on the island, they have already made an impact in drastically increasing public support for the new Regime in Britain, as the people can see that Atlee is bringing Britain towards a political system similar to the Union as it keeps a kingless society, however not to far gone as the Maximists or Right wing clubs of the Exiles support. Thus utilizing the public support for a moderate republican system, Atlee has pushed Hobart into accepting some reforms in reducing his own executive power and accepting a parliament once more. Now Atlee is arguably in control of the nation, however he cannot fully take the lead in pushing the nation towards new heights as Hobart is in the president’s seat in government, thus Prime Minister Atlee has to run ideas for reform past him in order to get it accepted, for Hobart is ever paranoid about a return to the Union or to the old system of the Windsors."
basedbrit.4.a:0 "A new shining light of liberty on the isle"

basedbrit.5.t:0 "Appeals to the Right"
basedbrit.5.d:0 "Firmly entrenching the newly arriving exiles is key to ensuring our foundations are not toppled by a dissatisfied populus, and so beginning to sway the majority of the British population to the newly arrived exiles ideals is necessary. Thus Hobart has given permission for massive rallies and government endorsed spreading of the nationalist exiles messages, paving the way for the population to be swayed over to a much more state friendly mindset. Already the nationalists have hopped onto this opportunity, with Joyce’s followers already organizing rallies to hopefully sway the populus over to their newly introduced mindset, and also potentially to scare off opponents with the numbers of the nationalist attendee’s. All the while Archibald Ramsay has been creating new clubs across various british regions to hopefully spread his catholic ideals onto the more older and wealthier conservative attendee’s and any who might partake in such country clubs. \n\nAll this cannot be denied to have a positive effect in entrenching a new british state, one without the risk of syndicalists or windsors steering us astray, however Hobart watches with a worried eye as all the new praise and popularity of the current situation is going towards Joyce’s nationalists, with him who had made it possible increasingly losing public image in favor of the newly arrived nationalists."
