### Tooltips ###
ENG_will_become_BRG:0 "§YThe Provisonal Government of Great Britain§! will be created"
### Decisions ###
BRG_pick_a_king:0 "The British Regency"
BRG_pick_a_king_desc:0 "Assembled at General Hobart's request, the Regency Council was formed will the sole propose to find and elect a new King for the British People. With the Windsors betraying every true blooded Briton when they fled to Canada, our possible pool of Kings and even a few Queens is quite large."

BRG_elect_wilhelm:0 "Elect the German Emperor"
BRG_elect_wilhelm_desc:0 "Ah Germany, the Global Hegemon, and our old enemy. While the history between our nations is storied and bloody, by electing the Kaiser we could put that behind us. Besides, the Entente would never risk a war with the Reichspact, thus the Kaiser would make for a very Monarch to protect our fair isles."

BRG_elect_romanov:0 "Elect the heir to the House of Romanov"
BRG_elect_romanov_desc:0 "The Romanovs, quite the strange option, but a viable one none the less. Despite losing power during the February Revolution, the honor of the Romanovs is unmatched. While never having ruled himself, Kirill is a noble man, and would make a fine King. Due to their blood relations with the Kaiser, a Romanov King could potentially see Britain in the Reichspact, if not an alliance with Russia herself, should the Empire be restored.

BRG_elect_frog:0 "Elect a Bourbon"
BRG_elect_frog_desc:0 "Despite not having ruled France for generations, the House of Bourbon still stands strong. While electing the claimant to one of our exiled enemies may seem strange, should the Nationalists in Algiers restore the Kingdom, we may be able to coax them into joining with us. If not, surly the Reichspact would accept us, if we offered to put down the Communards once and for all."

BRG_elect_bavarian:0 "Elect Rupprecht of Bavaria"
BRG_elect_bavarian_desc:0 "Rupprecht, King of Bavaria, loyal son of Germany, and Jacobite claimant to the English and Scottish thrones, is definitely not the first pick of the Regency. However, due to his German Kingship, meaning entrance into the Reichspact, along with his preexisting claims to Britain make him an appealing option none the less." 

BRG_elect_polock:0 "Elect Paweł Salwator 'Piast'"
BRG_elect_polock_desc:0 "An oddity among the claimants, Paweł Salwator 'Piast' as he calls himself, the self-proclaimed heir to the House of Piast, former ruling house of the Kingdom of Poland, was only seemingly brought before the Regency because he used to live in Liverpool. Due to the confusing status of both our own regency, along with that of Poland, Paweł, if elected, could potentially lead to an alliance with Poland. Although unlikely, we could also twist his story, and try to land ourselves in the Reichspact should Poland follow a different path."

BRG_elect_jap:0 "Elect Prince Yasuhito of Japan"
BRG_elect_jap_desc:0 "By far the most far flung option presented before the Regency Council, Prince Yasuhito is actually quite the logical choice. Due to his long time courting of British Nobility, he is  quite the familiar face to noble circles. Due to his status as Japanese Royalty, British entrance into the Japanese led Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere would be practically guaranteed. While the idea of Britain joining a military bloc half a world away might seem silly, we need allies, and Japan would certainly be a fitting one. "

BRG_elect_german_charles:0 "Elect Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha"
BRG_elect_german_charles_desc:0 "Seen as one of the most probable and likely candidates due to his preexisting claims on Britain, Charles Edward would indeed be quite the logical choice. A male-line descendent of the great Queen Victoria herself, not only would crowning Charles smooth things over with remaining Windsorite legitimists, it would cement our ties with Germany, and the Reichspact by extension."

BRG_elect_austrian_charles:0 "Elect Karl Pio of Austria"
BRG_elect_austrian_charles_desc:0 "A Carlist and Radical Traditionalist to boot, Karl Pio is not someone anyone would have thought could even be considered for King, but these are strange times. Proclaiming himself the rightful Carlist claimant following the death of Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, Karl Pio, despite his Spanish claims, is a Habsburg by birth. Due to this, by crowing him as King of Britain, we could gain the protection of Austria. Although no Germany, Austrian protection could be what it takes to ward off an attack by the Windsorites."

BRG_elect_mick:0 "Elect the head of Clan O'Neill"
BRG_elect_mick_desc:0 "Since the inception of the modern British state, the Irish have been something of a public enemy number one, thus few could expect that an Irishman could ever be seriously considered for the title of King of Britain. While Hugo José Jorge O'Neill is indeed a true blooded Irishman, he and his entire family have lived in Portugal since the 18th Century. Regardless, he is still and Irishman, and should we ever push forth our claims on the Emerald Isle, his Kingship could help smooth things over should push come to shove."

BRG_elect_christian:0 "Elect Christian of Denmark"
BRG_elect_christian_desc:0 "Even though a Norseman has not sat on the throne of Great Britain for well over a thousand years, the times of the great Viking raids are still remembered in the halls of British history. While the modern Kingdom of Denmark bares little to no resemblance to the one that once sailed and ruled the North Seas, they still exist as a sovereign nation. Despite recently pulling out of the Reichspact due to Black Monday, Denmark under King Christian X still has massive connections to the German sphere. By crowning Christian, we would be pulling ourselves into this sphere as a result, practically guaranteed our entrance into Germany's alliance, should we choose to join it."

BRG_elect_spainard:0 "Elect the King of Spain"
BRG_elect_spainard_desc:0 "With their last hopes of ruling Britain sinking with their Armada, none ever expected that a Spanish monarch could even dream of claiming the British Throne. However, with Hobart and his Regency searching every corner of Earth for a possible Monarch, and with Spain's preexisting good relations with Germany, it seems that Alfonso may have a decent shot at gaining the British throne that his predecessors coveted so."

BRG_elect_nap:0 "Elect the Heir to the House of Bonaparte"
BRG_elect_nap_desc:0 "While the House of Bonaparte as always been at odds with Britain, they still remain one of the most prestigious noble houses in all of the world. Though they haven't ruled in nearly 50 years, the ideals and glorious of the French Empire still remain with many, thus making a French restoration all the more possible. Should Napoleon be on our own throne, the chance of working with our old allies may become a reality, thus making the choice of a Bonaparte all the more tantalizing."  
BRG_elect_romanian_charles:0 "Elect the King of Romania"
BRG_elect_romanian_charles_desc:0 "King Carroll of Romania is perhaps the best example of the worst a monarch can be. His lavish lifestyle coupled with publicly flaunting his mistress makes him something of a playboy in his native Romania, a fact many cannot get over. However, Carroll also happens to be related to the Kaiser, making him a strategic, if not costly, pick for King."
BRG_elect_pasta:0 "Elect Amadeus of Italy"
BRG_elect_pasta_desc:0 "The House of Savoy, once uncontested masters of Italy, now reduced to living in exile and poverty. Despite losing power at the end of the Great War, this former Italian royalty still stands strong, prideful of their past glories. While holding little strategic value, by crowning a Savoy, we could right one of history's wrongs."

BRG_elect_swede:0 "Elect the King of Sweden"
BRG_elect_swede_desc:0 "Even though Sweden and Britain have had little formal relations over the years, Gustav, King of the Swedes, is surprisingly something of a popular choice. Perhaps reading Swedish Neutrality as flowing from the King, it is believed that by crowning him, we too would follow a path of neutrality. While this may or may not be the case, crowning Gustav would be far easier to get away then other choices for Monarch, due to his popularity." 

BRG_elect_bulgar:0 "Elect the Heir of Bulgaria"
BRG_elect_bulgar_desc:0 "Heir to the Tsardom of Bulgaria, Boris of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry is something of a moderate pick for King of Britain. As Heir-Apparent to the Bulgarian Tsardom, his crowning would both give him experience for when he becomes Tsar along with giving us a clear ally in Bulgaria. Due to Bulgaria's membership in the former Central Powers, we would have an in with the Reich, should the winds of power drift in it's direction."

BRG_elect_portugal:0 "Elect the King of Portugal"
BRG_elect_portugal_desc:0 "While having no claim on Britain itself, Portugal and Britain have been close allies and partners for the better part of the last 400 years. Due to this, what better what to cement that alliance than by sharing a monarch? While some may object, citing Portuguese flirtation with the Entente, our two nations are interlocked, and Portugal would surly join us over the perfidious Windsors, should we share a King."
BRG_elect_zog:0 "Elect the King of the Albanians"
BRG_elect_zog_desc:0 "Perhaps the newest face on the scene of Royalty, the House of Zogu, led by self-proclaimed King Zog of Albania, is shockingly quite a fitting match for our new Kingdom. While having no ambitions beyond Albania itself, with Zog at the helm, Britian would no doubt enter into a new era of glory."
BRG_elect_spanish_jacobite:0 "Elect the Spanish Jacobite"
BRG_elect_spanish_jacobite_desc:0 "A claimant to the Jacobite Succession via a bastard of James II,  Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart is in many ways the model noble. Dutifully serving the Spanish King, Jacobo, should he be elected, would fit the bill of a puppet King perfectly. Due to his place as a Jacobite claimant, he also has just the dash of legitimacy that makes him an all around perfect fit for King of Britain."

BRG_elect_franz_jospeh:0 "Elect the Prince of Lichtenstein"
BRG_elect_franz_jospeh_desc:0 "While the Principality of Lichtenstein itself is perhaps the smallest nation on Earth, it finds itself under the uncontestable protection of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Due to this, it has been suggest that Franz Joseph II, prince of Lichtenstein, be crowned as King of Britain. Should he be crowned, he could pave the way for us to join Austria as brothers in arms."

### Events ###
basedbrit.1.t:0 "Consolidating Power"
basedbrit.1.d:0 "The tyrannical overreaches of the Maximists had been the final straw, before Hobart had ordered the divisions loyal to him to overthrow them. The trade unionists who had been in power and hiding before the Maximists had seen Hobart’s men besieging the Maximists offices and the execution of their officials, and so foolishly came out in crowds to celebrate the change of power, expecting it was to go back to them. Needless to say that London was bathed in the same red blood of syndicalists as the banners they had waved in naivety, thinking that Hobart would really give power back to those that had failed the same revolution they preached. Now those socialists who had survived those massacres against them are in hiding, undeniably bitter and shocked at how Hobart had cleansed the slate completely of them, despite them putting their trust in him that he had come along to their ideals. \n\nYet it was not only the socialists who were thrown aside in shame, but also the exiled Windsors in Canada, who had expected Hobart to clear the way and welcome them home in open arms. They were promptly given a slap to the face when Hobart issued a decree barring them from returning to the isles, for they had betrayed the British people when they had not only failed to stop the bloodshed between state and people during the revolution of ‘25, but also cowardly ran away from the home isles. Now Hobart is standing in a very precarious and dangerous situation, for socialists and those loyal to the windsors are most assuredly plotting in their hiding. However one way Hobart can bring about a new foundation for Britain would be to invite those who despite their love for Britain had been exiled to Canada, and thus can be accepted back home."

basedbrit.2.t:0 "Return of The True Britons"
basedbrit.2.d:0 "While the revolution has been put down with the fist of Hobart, we cannot remain without support for too long before our precarious situation is brought down by popular uprising. Of course Hobart has already begun the process of accepting exiles back from Canada, particularly those who hold love for their isle and not any support for those Germans called the Windsors. Now there is as naturally expected some resistance to this and many of those stubborn conservatives remain alongside the Windsor king remain in Canada, however some political groups are willing to ditch the king and return home to join the process of creating a new system. \n\nThese two groups seeking to return home being those moderate members of the Labour party that went to Canada alongside the Exiles under Clement Atlee. There is also of course the much more nationalistic nordic following of Joyce, and the accompanying Right club under the head of Archibald Ramsey, who had converted to Catholicism in Canada due to his love and respect for the Pope’s supporters. \n\nNow Hobart must decide which group he will allow to join him in rebuilding Britain into a new and proper image. An image without that of the Windsors corrupting or destroying it."

basedbrit.4.t:0 "Republican Britain is back"
basedbrit.4.d:0 "The Labour party has returned to Britain and has now fully reintegrated itself into British society. Despite their relatively short time since arrival on the island, they have already made an impact in drastically increasing public support for the new Regime in Britain, as the people can see that Atlee is bringing Britain towards a political system similar to the Union as it keeps a kingless society, however not to far gone as the Maximists or Right wing clubs of the Exiles support. Thus utilizing the public support for a moderate republican system, Atlee has pushed Hobart into accepting some reforms in reducing his own executive power and accepting a parliament once more. Now Atlee is arguably in control of the nation, however he cannot fully take the lead in pushing the nation towards new heights as Hobart is in the president’s seat in government, thus Prime Minister Atlee has to run ideas for reform past him in order to get it accepted, for Hobart is ever paranoid about a return to the Union or to the old system of the Windsors."

basedbrit.5.t:0 "Appeals to the Right"
basedbrit.5.d:0 "Firmly entrenching the newly arriving exiles is key to ensuring our foundations are not toppled by a dissatisfied populus, and so beginning to sway the majority of the British population to the newly arrived exiles ideals is necessary. Thus Hobart has given permission for massive rallies and government endorsed spreading of the nationalist exiles messages, paving the way for the population to be swayed over to a much more state friendly mindset. Already the nationalists have hopped onto this opportunity, with Joyce’s followers already organizing rallies to hopefully sway the populus over to their newly introduced mindset, and also potentially to scare off opponents with the numbers of the nationalist attendee’s. All the while Archibald Ramsay has been creating new clubs across various british regions to hopefully spread his catholic ideals onto the more older and wealthier conservative attendee’s and any who might partake in such country clubs. \n\nAll this cannot be denied to have a positive effect in entrenching a new british state, one without the risk of syndicalists or windsors steering us astray, however Hobart watches with a worried eye as all the new praise and popularity of the current situation is going towards Joyce’s nationalists, with him who had made it possible increasingly losing public image in favor of the newly arrived nationalists."
basedbrit.5.a:0 "Bold strategy, let’s see if it pays off for Hobart"

basedbrit.6.t:0 "Joyce and Leese demand power!"
basedbrit.6.d:0 "With the Right and Nationalists circles greatly empowered and emboldened following Hobart's decision to apply to them, the popularity of the previously obscure British Far Right has exploded. The leaders of this new movement in the new Britain are William Joyce and Arnold Leese. Although both men differ in some political aspects their authoritarian leanings and anti-semitism have united them. With their power based united and growing they have marched on London and demanded to be handed the reigns of power. We have been assured the Army stands with us if we do strike them down now, but some at the top have misgivings. Could Britain survive another Revolution or even a Civil War?"
basedbrit.6.a:0 "We have no choice"
basedbrit.6.b:0 "Send these bastards home with their tails between their legs!"

basedbrit.7.t:0 "A New, Better Britain"
basedbrit.7.d:0 "Through the calculated use of threats and force James Joyce and Arnold Leese now hold Britain in their hands. While they bicker about the finer points differing their ideologies, their shared hatred of International Jewry and an almost rabid desire to wipe the stain of ‘Syndicalist Degenerate Progressivism’ off the Isles has united their two once disparate movements into one. Already they have made a dramatic move to remake their new and idealized Britain. In General Decree Number One both Joyce and Leese have declared the ‘Jewish Race’ to be unredeemable and a dangerous fifth column. As such they have declared any Jew caught on the British Isles after one month will be imprisoned indefinitely. This has aroused equal parts anger, disbelief and acceptance by the British population. Those following the diarchy have naturally sung the praises of this new edict and have begun to list all the Jews they know to hand over to the authorities. The rest of Britain however is confused as to why and how the edict will be carried out. The Union had a robust Jewish community. To do away with them, especially so rapidly, could only mean bad things. Already protests have begun by Jews and their sympathizers against the new decree. Time will tell if their shouts will fall on deaf ears however."
basedbrit.7.a:0 "Strength of Will will prevail"


basedbrit.8.t:0 "Offer from the Right Club"
basedbrit.8.d:0 "Hobart has unseated Mosely and his brood, saving Britain from untold despotism, and has refused to bend to the demented Legionaries to boot. However his reign is still unstable. Totalist thugs patrol the streets, Syndicalists across Britain are mobilizing to save their broken homeland and the few remaining Legionaries refused to go down without a fight. However, Hobart has found an unlikely and some say undesirable ally in The Right Club. Formed by a cabal of right wing and Catholic former and current aristocracy they have found a new home in the new Britain after suffering years of inglorious exile in Canada with the rest of the British government. Now however, while Edward and his friends wine and dine in Ottawa the Right Club has come home and quickly become the poster child of the new British far right. While not as radical as some like Joyce and Leese, their traditionalist, aristocratic and more importantly Catholic leanings have turned many a common man away from them. They are a snapshot of the Britain the Union worked so hard to destroy. Ultimately the Union failed and with the death of the Union the old regime's sympathizers have come out of the woodwork to give this new right wing a serious political voice. The Club's words carry real weight and that cannot be dismissed so easily. What should we do?"
basedbrit.8.a:0 "Anything to stop the Syndicalists!"
basedbrit.8.b:0 "We don't need help from a cabal of Papists!"



basedbrit.9.t:0 "Catholic Britain?"
basedbrit.9.d:0 "The Right Club has used their new inroads into power to quickly spread their influence deep into the halls of power. Like a lightning bolt Archibald Ramsay has become one of if not the most powerful man in Britain, rivaling only Hobart himself. However the old general seemingly couldn’t win this last, most important battle. Through political maneuvers so rapid and cynical they would make even the most pragmatic of men’s heads turn Ramsay has rapidly outmaneuvered Hobart. Today Archibald Ramsay has been named Chancellor of Britain making him second in command of the nation. Those in the know already are aware of the general's powerlessness in the face of the Club. That leaves Archibald Ramsay and his Right Club in control of the nation and signals the ultimate conquest of England by the Roman Catholic Church. What comes next is not certain but already what Church of England officials came out of hiding have spoken of their misgivings and whispers of a Catholic restoration in England whirl like a tornado, pulling at the threads of the broad rightist coalition Ramsey leads. Now all of Britain, and indeed the world, waits with bated breath to see what the Club does next."
basedbrit.9.a:0 "Pro Deo et Patria!"

basedbrit.10.t:0 "Hobart consolidates power"
basedbrit.10.d:0 "Percy Hobart has done what many assumed impossible and came out on top of the post-Syndicalist power struggle. Facing a hostile populace, an unruly Army and an uncertain foreign situation Hobart has bested all the vultures circling him and now has total control over the new Britain. This has worried some as speculations on Hobart’s monarchist leanings continue to circulate. However people close to him profess that from what they know of Hobart, his views have undergone a serious shift. The Hobart of 1919 is not the Hobart of now. He now has a burning hatred of the Windsors who cowardly fled England rather than face down the Revolutionaries. Indeed they speculate that Hobart has come to despise monarchy as a whole. Instead they guess that Hobart will instead keep the power centralized in the military “the only institution left that can truly uphold British values” by his own words. Despite their professions however it's ultimately up to Hobart as to what he will do ultimately. "

basedbrit.11.a:0 "we will not make the mistakes of the trojans"

basedbrit.11.t:0 "Confronting the Trojan Horse"
basedbrit.11.d:0 "In the ancient stories Troy was on the cusp of victory over the Greeks when they foolishly dragged in a horse built as a parting gift by their foe. While the Trojans celebrated their victory the treacherous Greeks emerged from the horse and slaughtered Troy in its moment of farcical victory. Ramsay recognizes the Jewish races as the new Trojan Horse who work not for the betterment of their host nations but in pursuit of the Council of Zion’s esoteric and sinister goals. Ramsay will not throw Britain to the wolves just as he has taken control. To face this new ‘Trojan Horse’ as he likes to call the Jews as a group he has issued Emergency Decree One which requires all Jews to register in the new National Registry of Enemy Aliens. The name is intentionally provocative as a less than subtle way to tell the Jews their plots have become uncovered and hopefully encourage them to leave. Those who stay will be closely watched for when they ultimately slip up and give Ramsay proof of their evil ways."
basedbrit.11.a:0 "We shall burn this Trojan Horse!"

basedbrit.12.t:0 "An End to Party Politics"
basedbrit.12.d:0 "Today, to a mildly shocked nation, the old General Percy Hobart announced his retirement from politics like the great Lord Fairfax of the Civil War. He claims the reasons are for his health, which may be partly true, but it's been plainly clear for a while that Hobart has been little more than a figurehead for the Right Club. As Hobart and Ramsay fight more and more over their differing opinions it's clear that Hobart’s time in government is over. Any remaining influence he could have had over the government is long since gone and he has lost control of his own Revolution. After Hobart was shooed off the stage by Ramsay the new undisputed head of Britain made a shock announcement. He launched into a long tirade against party politics and blamed such a system for causing the Syndicalist Revolution and the resulting moral and ethical degeneration of the national politic. To remedy the crisis Ramsay banned all political parties which had been allowed to form under Hobart. He forcefully absorbed the myriad of right wing parties and banned anything any more left than him or the British Legion. Leftist leaders have been rounded up and arrested across Britain, all save for Attlee who has escaped once more. The potential for British democracy had been smothered in its cradle and as he finished his speech Archibald Ramsay, its murderer, was showered with applause."
basedbrit.12.a:0 "Only we can save Britain now"

basedbrit.13.t:0 "Aristocratic Alliance"
basedbrit.13.d:0 "Archibald Ramsay and the Right Club have begun reaching out to British aristocratic exiles across the Empire to find supporters to bring into the country. These aristocrats have long been left without property and incomes forcing them to drain their vast wealth reserves. Some lesser nobles have even been forced into menial labor to make ends meet. As a way to secure their allegiance Ramsay has promised them a full and complete restoration of their rights, properties and incomes once his rule is secure. Such an offer is tempting, even to those who originally were not a fan of Ramsay. Already numerous former aristocratic families have left their exiles in India, Australasia and Canada and traveled back to the Home Islands to claim what they lost all those years ago. This ‘Great Reclamation’ has ruffled feathers as police and army units repossessed former estates for their old owners, kicking out families and businesses that inhabited them since they were seized during the Revolution. Astute observers have also noted that a vast majority of these aristocrats invited back home have been Catholics. Rumors of the Right Clubs embracing of Catholicism had been stirring since Ramsay first entered the government under Hobart. Now it looks increasingly likely that those rumors are true. Nevertheless it is much too late to turn back now. Britain is too far down their new path to turn back now."
basedbrit.13.a:0 "The chains reforged"

basedbrit.14.t:0 "Local Authority"
basedbrit.14.d:0 "As Ramsay reforges Britain into his ideal society he has embraced the idea of decentralization to a degree. While the TUC in the Union under Mosely kept a tight leash on most anything done anywhere in the Union, Ramsay has taken the opposite approach. Instead he has delegated more power to local governance now headed by local aristocrats. These newly empowered aristocrats have wasted little time in using their new shreds of power to reassert their own, and by extension governmental, control over the ever rambunctious lower class. This has not gone unnoticed by the once more downtrodden and already clashes have begun between remnant Syndicalists and government forces. These skirmishes are however minor and pose little if any real threat to unseating Ramsay. It's also been noticed that Ramsay seems to be giving more power faster to Catholic aristocrats. As people once again wonder just where Ramsay’s religious allegiances lie they all know in the back of their heads where this leads and few are prepared to welcome it."
basedbrit.14.a:0 "The Old Order returns"

basedbrit.15.t:0 "Legacy of the Cavaliers"
basedbrit.15.d:0 "As part of Ramsay’s new propaganda blitz against the remnant dissident factions across the nation he has taken to lionizing the Cavaliers of the old Civil War. The Cavaliers, those who supported King Charles I in the Civil War, have been hailed as true Englishman who knew where their true loyalties lay. Their heroics and tenacity were undercut by the unfaithfulness of the people who were lured away from their rightful liege by Cromwell and his cabal. Not only that but Ramsay has encouraged the archetypal cavalier style among his friends and associates. This has drawn some laughter of course, but never within Ramsay’s earshot."
basedbrit.15.a:0 "Not entirely unexpected"

basedbrit.17.t:0 "Return of the Roman Church"
basedbrit.17.d:0 "Today Ramsay has signed the Roman Concordat in Rome with the Pope. The Concordat in simple terms brings the Church of England back under Papal purview. This has finally mended the British schism from Rome. Already Ramsay has reportedly picked out a new Archbishop of the newly Catholic Archdiocese of Canterbury, the hardline Francis Bourne. To do this Bourne has been granted significant autonomy within the Church. This autonomy however has strict limits especially when dealing with core Church doctrine. With Bourne at his back there is no doubt that Ramsay will seek to destroy the Church of England on the Home Islands and bring Britain firmly back into the Catholic world. This has been met with condemnation from across the English world. In Canada the Exiles have denounced this move in the strongest language possible and still maintain the Church of England is wholly and totally separate from Rome. The English Archbishop of Canterbury-in-Exile Cosmo Lang also issued a statement urging resistance to efforts to reconvert the Islands. This has been taken up by rag tag Moral Defense Units, little more than zealous mobs, who have gathered and pledged to resist any conversion attempts. It remains to be seen if they could live up to such lofty pledges."
basedbrit.17.a:0 "England has once more seen the Light!"

basedbrit.18.t:0 "Return of the King?"
basedbrit.18.d:0 "With the last and greatest of Ramsay’s reforms done it's now time to formally induct England back into the faith with the crowning of a truly Catholic monarch. This monarch will not lead some heretical ‘Church of England’ but will act in accordance to God’s true wishes as spelled out in the Bible. Resisting both the Protestant and English heathens will be difficult but with God's grace anything can be done. Ramsay has drawn up a list of suitable candidates. At the top of said list is Ramsay himself naturally. As the man who brought England to the light of Rome it's only natural he oversaw the cementing of Catholic influence on England for all time. Despite his want for the title however Ramsay feels it improper to simply crown himself King like a common usurper. He has no royal lineage in any case. Instead he will simply take the title of Lord High Chancellor, a title of no limits which will also be bestowed upon his son or other chosen heir. This will make him a King in all but name, but by that reasoning then isn't every autocrat a King? The second choice is Edward Fitzherbert, the 13th Baron Stafford as King Richard IV. As the son of Edward Stafford he has the blood of the Plantagenet Kings in his veins. While he has expressed no explicit interest in pushing his long since thought dead ancestral claim to the throne, an offer of the crown would be hard to turn down. Another more radical proposal is to crown Karl Pius von Hapsburg as Charles III. As leader of the most radical of the traditionalist Carlist movement, he has more knowledge in how to rule a true and pious Catholic nation. Not only that but his blood ties with Austria could prove usefully, should we find ourselves adrift without allies. The final and most radical proposal is Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria being crowned as James III. This is a truly radical proposal and has met with severe opposition. He is a German who fought hard against British troops in the Weltkrieg. To crown him could be seen as a slap in the face of all those who fought. However, the new Britain Ramsay leads is isolated. The Entente want nothing to do with him for obvious reasons and the Internationale sits on the other end of the Channel, watching the White Cliffs of Dover with vengeful eyes. If foreign alliances are not found soon then the light of God could be snuffed out of the British Isles once more. By crowning Rupprecht, Ramsay could draw closer to the Kaiser. Strange times breed stranger friends. Also he does have a claim to the Jacobite throne, however tenuous. He is the descendent of Charles of Sardinia who inherited the Jacobite claim after the extinction of the Royal Stuart line in 1807."

Now every man is little better than an animal, rampaging around filling his base desires. This degeneracy cannot go on any longer. We shall reraise the old pillars of the Knight into British hearts.

With their heads still so far up their own asses they can see out of their own mouths they return to us, demanding their own rights back. Unfortunately for them they gave up those old rights the moment they abandoned Britannia in her hour of more dire need. Instead we will replace these fat and lazy monkeys with the virile and heroic Legionaries who fought so hard to save British civilization. The old aristocrats' lands will be doled out proportional to the person's ranks until there is none left to give. With a robust and loyal aristocratic class our power will be ever more secure."

basedbrit.38.t:0 "An Ass for the Throne"
basedbrit.38.d:0 "Hobart has no real love of Kings. Watching George flee London like a rat fleeing a sinking ship soured him forever to the prospect. However he recognizes the historical weight the title King of England commands in the British psyche, even still. Some have suggested they invite the King in Canada back, but Hobart has dismissed such suggestions out of hand. He gave up his throne the moment he left England to the Syndicalists. In response Hobart’s aides have brought a list of nearly 30 names as suggestions for King. These range from Yasuhito of Japan to Kaiser Wilhelm. In the end Hobart knows who he chooses doesn't really matter as he will keep the power behind the throne but still, the choice would have tremendous symbolic value so it must not be taken lightly."

basedbrit.39.t:0 "Redeeming Cromwell's Legacy"
basedbrit.39.d:0 "When Cromwell dissolved the Rump Parliament in 1653 and took the title of Lord Protector, England found itself without a King for the first time. Despite the panicked cries of the Royalists, England survived. At least until his idiot son mucked it up. He ruled an England that was approaching the prosperity it had never seen before. In recognition of his efforts Hobart has decided that Britons will never again be slaves to some King. Hobart instead has taken the title of Lord Protector and abolished the English throne. This has been met with disappointment and even anger by the rest of the Empire. They had expected Hobart to invite the King back to London but now these hopes have been dashed. Instead the King-in-Exile has released a statement declaring he is still King and that Hobart is a ‘petty usurper’ who ‘plays at King without calling it such’. This has been supported by the Entente as a whole. Despite this Hobart seems to have no intentions of reversing his decision and England sails into the future on uncertain waters."

basedbrit.41.d:0 "Hobart has come to recognize the failings of democracy. In the UK it paralyzed the system and allowed the Syndicalists to take over. In America democracy plunged the nation into not one but two civil wars in 100 years! In Russia the state constantly walks a tightrope between anarchy and despotism as its wobbly democratic institutions continue to threaten to fall. Hobart has seen democracy in action and has seen it fail time and time again. He has resolved to not make the same mistake once more. Instead he shall create a ruling junta led by himself. No elections, no pretense at ‘democracy’. Just the rule of law and order. Some of his more liberal advisors are dismayed at his decision but there is little they could do. With his power secure and troops still in the streets the people read the announcement of the canceling of elections and shrug apathetically. They just want peace and Hobart knows that. Those who do feel the need to protest will fall into line in time, one way or another."

However he is not stupid enough to let the people have all the power. When they did that they steered the nation into despotism. Instead he has announced a system of guided elections. The people will largely steer the ship of state but the military shall retain the right to intervene should a ‘radical’ party win too much. Some worry that this would end democracy in Britain but Hobart assures him that the Army would never wantonly crush any government that disagrees with them. What are they? Russians?"

basedbrit.44.d:0 "Today British police and Army units finally tracked down the arch-traitor Oswald Mosley. He had holed up with the last of his Maximists near Birmingham in an area once overlooked by police. The building he had holed up in was rather unassuming but as it was surrounded by a British Army regiment with a tank in support, it quickly became apparent that something was about to happen. As a man shouted at the building for Mosely to come out there was the slightest glint of a rifle scope in one of the windows. Before anybody could react, the crack of a rifle heralded the beginning of the Battle of Birmingham as its now called. British soldiers stormed through the bottom floor in a ferocious battle with local blackshirts as the tank outside fired multiple rounds into the upper floors, blowing away huge sections of the facade. The outcome was never in doubt however. When British soldiers finally reached Mosely’s office they found the door had been blown off when a tank shell blew through the window. They ran through to find the one time Grand Protector of the Union of Britain on the ground sobbing and grabbing the stump where his left leg once was. It was quickly located on the other side of the room. Mosley looked at the soldiers and demanded they help him “so he may face trial as befitting a British citizen”. He was promptly shot dead by Pvt James Teaton. After reading the report submitted by the regiment Hobard simply shrugged and crossed Mosley’s name off of his list. One more enemy of the state is gone."

Hobart however feels the body has outlived its usefulness. When the TUC tried to meet again today its remaining members were met with British soldiers who had chained the doors of the meeting room shut. They declared in no uncertain terms that the TUC was now an illegal organization and they had this one chance to turn and leave. If they remained they would be considered terrorists and arrested on the spot. Few delegates stuck around. Most knew this was an action long in the making and simply went home to find a new job.

Attlee however sees it differently. He was never a fan of TUC rule and even less so after Mosley took over. Now the TUC is done and a sense of normalcy has returned Attlee sees himself and his Labor Party as the final protectors of the rights of the workers left. While the new Labor Party are not revolutionary Syndicalists and are certainly not Maximists, Attlee knows the people are still suspicious.

While some vital industries like energy and water and transportation will remain in government hands the rest of the governments wide ranging monopolies are already in the process of being broken up and sold off once more. Whenever possible the government has also resolved to return private businesses to those who once ran it.

Reports have come in that across the nation Maxamist administrators simply changed their uniforms to avoid detection during the initial purge. With the work that came afterwards being so pressing, they were never thoroughly vetted. This has allowed dangerous elements to lurk in our power structure. These men are loyal not to the new Britain but to Syndicalism and Mosely himself. At the time it was needed as the state could not have survived if its entire bureaucratic machine was torn down at once. Now however the government has decided enough is enough. The apparatus of state at all levels will be filtered with a fine tooth comb. Those who are found to be lacking in loyalty will be fired and, if the need arises, arrested.

basedbrit.54.d:0 "The venerable General Hobart, liberator of the Isles, has announced he is stepping away from politics effective immediately. To outsiders this makes a kind of sense. Hobart is approaching his 60s and the stress of ruling has made him older by a decade. However to those in the know it makes a different kind of sense. Clement Attlee has been consolidating power under himself for some time, rallying the democratic opposition to Hobart. Hobart tried to spar against him and secure his seat but ultimately he failed. With his resignation there will be snap elections for the Presidency, a new post left vacant by Hobart’s departure. These elections are merely a formality though. Attlee has made sure that he was the face of the democratic opposition to Hobart and his name is on everybody’s lips. He is the Good Syndicalist. He didn't partake in the horrors and excesses of Mosely, he was just a benign technocrat doing what he must to save his country. Now the Good Syndicalist is running for the highest office in the land. To nobody's surprise and everybody’s jubilation, he will win. The only real question is what he will do with this newfound power."

basedbrit.55.d:0 "It was thought to be impossible. After the fall of Mosely Syndicalism was disgraced to the British. Then Attlee was elected. Then it was said that it was impossible that he could pass even a fraction of his planned reforms. They were all syndicalist in nature and again, Syndicalism in Britain was dead! Then Attlee got them all passed. Now nobody says anything. Instead they stand in awe of the new Britain Attlee has created. The explicitly revolutionary ideology of Syndicalism has finally worked within a democratic context. The doom and gloom of the right wing who predicted a return of the Maxamists never came to pass. Yet, at the same time the far left who saw Attlee as a precursor to a return of TUC rule were also left disappointed. Instead the vast majority of Britons now enjoy a thriving democracy, a robust welfare state, workers protections unmatched in any non-Syndicalist nation and finally but almost certainly more importantly, peace. Britain finally knows peace after decades of tumult and upheaval. There are few who won't lay down their lives to defend this new peace either. "

basedbrit.56.t:0 "A Question of Leadership"
basedbrit.56.d:0 "Today, on the headline of the London Times, James Joyce unleashed a ferocious broadside against Arnold Leese. The two have led the new Britain in tandem since their ascension to power but both men are ferociously ambitious. Everybody knew that there was only enough room in town for one leader. In the halls of power there has been an incredible amount of shouting and even a couple of fist fights between the two as their political ideologies' differences become more and more pronounced. James Joyce sees Britons as the best and most civilized nation on Earth. With their liberation from Syndicalist slavery he belives its their duty to expand across the world so that all might bathe in its civiliizng light. He also believes that Britons should strive for peak physical fitness to bring out their natural physical superiority. Arnold Leese however has a different view. He believes that all Britons are imbued with the spiritual strength of the collective Aryan race. He believes that through spiritual purity part of that inherited power will be released, giving the average Briton almost superhuman strength and endurance. While Joyce believes that the Jews simply control society, Leese believes the International Jewish conspiracy extends even into people's souls. He believes that the existence of Jews corrupts the Spiritual collective of the people and acts as another suppressant of the Briton’s natural power. Joyce thinks this is all spiritualist nonsense, while Leese has begun to describe Joyce as a ‘kosher legionnaire’. In the end only one of these two can come out on top. Who should it be?"

basedbrit.57.d:0 "At his announcement speech of his ascension to the title of Lord High Chancellor popular rage at Ramsay has boiled over. A zealous individual pushed his way through the crowd and shouted “One Church! One England” before unloading his pistol towards the newly minted High Chancellor. At once the crowd descended on the assassin and before police could push their way to him, beat him to death beyond recognition. Meanwhile the Lord High Chancellor collapsed on the stage, bleeding from a bullet hole. As Ramsay lays in his hospital bed his second in command Hilarie Belloc has assumed command of the state. He has begun a massive purge of remaining Churchmen and ordered MI6 to hunt down the subversive elements still in Britain. However, despite his leadership few see this as a true coup. Belloc is as steadfast in his love for Ramsay as he is in his love for Britain. Should the Chancellor wake up its no question he will step aside. The only question now is…will Ramsay wake up?"

basedbrit.58.t:0 "Tea Fit for a King"
basedbrit.58.d:0 "It has been sometime since Hobart and his Junta assembled the so-called 'Regency Council,' to search for and eventually crown a new King of Britain, after the House of Windsor so foolishly abandoned their mandate. In that time, the hope and optimism that initially followed the council's creation has fluttered away, replaced with a spirit of annoyance, gridlock, and depression. Every possible monarch that is proposed before the body was rejected, and it is was increasingly likely that a situation to liken to Poland's own so-called 'Eternal Regency' would have developed. Today however, those fears have melted away, as the Regency Council has formally announced to the nation and the wider world that a King was finally chosen! The man to become the next King of Britain is none other than Sir Sidney Robert Greville, a former servant to the Royal Household of the Windsor. Although initially fleeing to Canada along with the King whom he served dutifully, following Hobart's coup and the return of various exile Britons who denounced loyalty to the House of Windsor, Greville too would renounce his Sovereign, out of a desire to see his home before his death. Upon his return, Greville offered his services to Hobart's regime, hoping to pay back the man who had freed his home, which Hobart was all too happy to accept. Eventually going from a simple personal aid to head of staff for the entire Electoral Council, Greville was at the times the sole smile within the chambers of the Electors, as he brought and poured piping hot tea to each elector personally. This friendly repour was seemingly infectious, as somehow Greville was unanimously elected by all Electors in the early hours of the morn, just before Greville would bring morning tea as he also did. As for Greville himself, he graciously accepted the position,  promising to dutifully keep to his subjects just as he had the regency council."

While the new British government is untested, the allure of the world's greatest navy is a strong one. Besides, we could use more allies couldn't we?"
