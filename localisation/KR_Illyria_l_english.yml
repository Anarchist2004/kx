#### ILLYRIAN LEADERS ####

CRO_STJEPAN_RADIC_DESC: "A Croat liberal, Stjepan Radić has always been fighting for Croatia, and now that the Croats are in charge of Illyria, Illyria. Always having supported Croatian autonomy, in the 1927 Ausgleich, which formed the Kingdom of Illyria, Radić fervently supported the creation of Illyria, as a way to cement Croatia's place in the Balkans. Having famously said not to "rush like drunken geese into the fog" as a way to convince his fellow Croats that it wasn't just a way for Austria and Hungary to keep dominion over Croatia. The Croat delegates then finally accepted the Ausgleich, and Bosnia, Montenegro, Dalmatia, and Croatia-Slavonia were merged to form the Kingdom of Illyria, as a separate entity of the Austro-Hungarian empire, with Radić at its head."
CRO_SVETOZAR_PRIBICEVIC_DESC: "A member of the Croato-Serbian Coalition, Svetozar Pribićević supports the creation of a pan-Slavic state that will finally unite the Slavs into a single political entity. He has always opposed Austrian influence, and clamors for Illyrian independence and the absorption of Slovenia and the Littoral into Illyria. Austria has always eyed the HSK with suspicion, and it is no different now. Pribićević aspires for an independent Illyria, as do his more radical followers in the HSK. Pribićević's ambitions may bear fruition soon, with the rising threat of war for Austria, and the Empire stands on a seesaw, ready to tip either towards success or collapse."
CRO_JOSIP_TITO_DESC: "Josip Broz Tito, leader of the social democratic party of Illyria, is a follower of Austria, although he is eyed with suspicion as some view him to have Syndicalist sympathies. Nobody really knows what Tito does or who he follows, but what is known is that he is a preacher of equality and fairness for the people of Illyria, as to keep it from its total collapse. Tito also is a veteran of the Weltkrieg, having fought in Serbia and Russia, but he went missing for some time after the Weltkrieg, where nobody knew where he was, but some say he was assisting the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War. Nevertheless, Tito's influence is growing, and what his plans are certain to nobody."

#### ILLYRIAN EVENTS ####

ausnews.1.t: "The Slovenia Crisis"
ausnews.1.d: "Although the Austro-Hungarian Empire has been on a razor's edge for decades now, its position tips ever closer to falling. Slovenia, long an integral part of Austria proper, has been petitioning entry into Illyria ever since its inception in the 1927 Ausgleich. Relations between the Austrians and Slovenes have reached a tipping point at last, as Slovenes threaten secession and rebellion if Austria does not listen to them. Relations between the Special Status Territory of Illyria and Austria have also been strained, as the Illyrian government supports the Slovenes. Talk spreads in Zagreb about the possibility of revolt. Meanwhile, the three other crowns of the Empire sit on the sidelines, wondering whether to secede themselves or stay in it to the end."
ausnews.1.a: "Let's see what happens..."

collapse_news.1.t: "Great Slovene Uprising"
collapse_news.1.d: "Today, news that was expected finally reached the press - the outbreak of the flames of rebellion in Slovenia, tied down by stubborn Austrians. The Illyrian government is meanwhile wondering whether to support the bloodshed or denounce it. Nevertheless, Austria has found itself at war again.\nAustria's military record hasn't been the greatest in recent times, so it remains to see whether what Karl has done has made any impact on the army's fighting position."

cro.1.t: "The Illyrian War of Independence"
cro.1.d: "The Austrian weight bearing down upon our nation has been thrown off for now, but it is only a matter of time before it crashes back down on us. We must act now, to protect and serve all of Illyria!"
cro.1.a: "Hurrah!"

cro.2.t: "The War Ends"
cro.2.d: "The dust has settled. Much time fighting has wearied our country, but we stand strong and proud. Illyria is now on its own on the world stage, ready to forge its own destiny, independent from Austria. Our people applaud our returning soldiers, but the families of the dead weep in the meantime. But to all, the message is clear: Illyria is free."
cro.2.a: "Where next?"

cro.3.t: "Bombing in Zagreb!"
cro.3.d: "A mere hour ago, a bomb exploded in Zagreb! The death counter has not yet been tallied, but many are hurt or dead. A suspect has been apprehended, a pro-Austrian man carrying a concealed pistol as well."
cro.3.a: "How terrible!"

cro.4.t: "The Bosnian Guerillas"
cro.4.d: "In the Dinaric Alps, there exists a Bosnian guerilla independence group, terrorizing the local populace and hellbent on bringing Bosnia out of Illyria. At all costs, these terrorists must be stopped before they manage to convince Bosnia to leave us."
cro.4.a: "Oh no."

cro.5.t: "The Interim Republic Free"
cro.5.d: "The Illyrian War of Independence is over. The Republic stands victorious, as Austria crumbles further. For Illyria, this marks a new day, a new age: an age of independence, freedom, and prosperity. And it will all begin here, now, as this war ends. But now that the "Interim" Republic is free, it is time to get rid of the Interim, and decide what to do with ourselves. Do we proceed with an election right now, or do we wait till Illyria further stabilizes from war?"
cro.5.a: "Begin the elections."
cro.5.b: "Wait a little bit..."

cro.6.t: "The Raid on Mostar "
cro.6.d: "Bosnian Guerrillas have seen a recent surge in strength following independence. But now, the most powerful attack yet has been conducted on the Southern Bosnian City of Mostar. This raid cost the lives of almost 150 army officials and injured over 100 civilians and civilians in a bloody street battle that almost leveled the city square. From now on, we must crush these insurgents and make sure that the citizens are safe from these rabid Bosnians. "
cro.6.a: "Teach the next Bosnians that show up a "lesson"."
cro.6.b: "Raise additional police."

cro.7.t: "The "Benevolent" Illyrian Army"
cro.7.d: "A sight of horror was all that was seen in the city of Mostar. The Free reign granted by the Army has resulted in a brutal slaughter of not just the guerilla forces, but the innocent people of the city of Mostar. By the day’s end, the soldiers had conducted brutal reprisals and out of pure spite leveled half the city and randomly executed innocent civilians. Blood drenched the city, as the fires were set, and the city burned to ash. These horrific actions have sent a clear message to all of Illyria: The Military is not afraid to use harsh, and even brutal force to tap down rebellion. This massacre has garnered widespread condemnation, and citizens of Bosnia fear their government. And despite the intended message of these reprisals, this has only enflamed demands for independence. As the citizens of Bosnia no longer trust the government to keep them safe."
cro.7.a: "Oh my god..."

cro.10.t: "The Elections begin!"
cro.10.d: "The proceedings with the first Illyrian elections have begun. The results we be in by 20 days. \n\n This election lets you choose the winner, and who wins doesn't affect your focus choices all that much."
cro.10.a: "Let the best candidate win!"

cro.11.t: "The Results are in!"
cro.11.d: "The election's results are in. And the first President of Illyria is..."
cro.11.a: "Social Democrat Josip Broz Tito wins!"
cro.11.b: "the HSK and the HKSSP form a Coalition under Svetozar Pribićević!"
cro.11.c: "The HPSS under Vladko Maček wins!"

cro.12.t: "Illyria wants to buy our fleet"
cro.12.d: "Illyria has offered us obscene amounts of money in return for the purchase of our fleet."
cro.12.a: "Irresistible!"
cro.12.b: "But I want my fleet!"

cro.13.t: "Illyria wants to implement economic ties"
cro.13.d: "Our New Allies in Illyria have meet to discuss economic ties between our two nations. Taking this agreement would ensure prosperity for both of our nations. But if we accept, we could become economically dependent on Illyria. What should we do? Should we accept the proposed economic ties?"
cro.13.a: "Allow them to."
cro.13.b: "No."

cro.17.d: "Illyria, our South Slavic brother, has come forward with a rather interesting proposal: form a Federation. Our government will be merged with theirs, creating a South Slavic Federation, which will be equal and fair. Their population rigidly supports Panslavism, and it has spread to other Slavic countries.

cro.23.t: "Tito's Decision"
cro.23.d: "Josip Broz Tito, current President of Illyria, has a choice to make. Illyria is in a state of crisis. Multiple minorities and ethnicities threaten secession from our country if we don't grant them more autonomy. Since Tito is a suspected Syndicalist, there are suspicions of him and ministers lurk in the background, watching his every move. Now that there is a chance... does Tito really have Syndicalist sympathies?"

cro.24.d: "From the beginning of their time in our state, the Bosnians have been a thorn in our side. Being one of the farthest regions from the capitol, they have constantly agitated for some sort of autonomous status, even more so than the other states of the empire. Now, they have come to us yet again with a request for greater autonomy within their own borders. While these demands are tiring, denying them could lead to reprecussions that would be more detrimental to us than merely granting their request. What should we do?"
cro.24.a: "They have enough already."
cro.24.b: "Whatever."

cro.25.t: "Vladko Maček assassinated!"
cro.25.d: "Vladko Maček, liberator of Illyria, first President of the Republic, is dead. Shot by an assassin this morning, they say. His death is mourned across the Southern Slavs as a hero, a fighter for the Southern Slavs. The assassin has been apprehended, and it was to our surprise a fellow Slav, a Bosnian. The Bosnian assassin proceeded to spout nonsense about how Illyria was planning to do away with the Bosnians, get rid of their autonomy, and more unintelligible blabber. Already, Bosnians demand the release of this assassin, and others demand his execution. Whatever we do to him, not everyone will be happy..."
cro.25.a: "Rest in peace."

cro.26.t: "Anti-Bosnian Movement"
cro.26.d: "In the wake of the assassination of our liberator, the peoples of Illyria have been hit by a wave of anti-Bosnianism. Bosnians get ridiculed on the streets, segregated by the citizenry, and other horrible deeds are done upon them, even though it wasn't their fault. This is how a group works, though. Of course, our guerilla friends down in the mountains are less than pleased about this. They promise to avenge their Bosnian brethren, and reports have indeed been circulating of increased membership in their terrorist group."
cro.26.a: "Stop at once!"

cro.27.t: "Street Fights"
cro.27.d: "The situation is getting no better. The Bosnians have struck back now, and brawling and protest and counter-protest a norm in large Illyrian cities. Police have been deployed, but it does nothing - they too suffer from bias, and the police are leaning towards civil war as the Bosnian police and the other police units clash to protect their preferred side. Our government, according to the government, is about to tip into anarchy..."
cro.27.a: "We said stop!"

cro.28.t: "Ante Trumbić Declares State of Emergency"
cro.28.d: "With the urging of multiple government members, the Illyrian Republic has declared its first state of emergency. The militias are in use now, keeping peace in the towns, and luckily, they are more loyal than the police. However, clashes continue, and deaths are racking up as days pass. Illyria, if not already, is in a state of civil war."

cro.29.t: "Bosnian Guerillas Capture Sarajevo"
cro.29.d: "The Bosnian Guerillas, neglected but noticed, have been thrust into the spotlight with a troubling development. Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia, has just been captured by the guerillas. Little fighting occurred, except between the guerillas and militias, in which the militia was forced to surrender. The guerillas have taken control of much of southern Bosnia. Something in the air tells our government that Bosnia will be independent soon..."
cro.29.a: "Oh no.."

cro.30.t: "Bosnian State Declared!"
cro.30.d: "They were right. Articles of a declaration of independence were drafted a few hours ago, and the guerilla forces have only continued to expand in number. Now, they rise up all across Bosnia in the name of their new nation. A wave of unrest has also hit nearby territories such as Slovenia and Montenegro, who think that out situation will get worse, and to get out of it as fast as possible. The Bosnian guerillas, now a Bosnian army, have begun marching every direction in order to take their independence back from us. Whatever we do, we can't give in!"
cro.30.a: "Stop these terrorists!"

cro.31.t: "Ante Trumbić Deposed!"
cro.31.d: "The second President of the Illyrian Republic, Ante Trumbić, is no longer leading the country! A few hours ago, armed men stormed his office, putting him at gunpoint and resulting in a hostage situation. The building was put on lockdown, and the men threatened him until he gave up power to their demanded candidate: Ante Pavelić. Pavelić has accepted the new post and has already done away with the rest of the government, resulting in a military junta under the watch of Ante Pavelić. The junta effectively rules Illyria, though Pavelić and his Party of Rights controls the goverment. Riots have cropped up and spread throughout Zagreb and beyond upon the hearing of this news. But the message to all is the same: The Illyrian Republic is no more."
cro.31.a: "Long live Poglavnik Pavelić and the Military!"

cro.32.t: "Citizenry Rioting"
cro.32.d: "Dissent is rife in the ranks of the citizens, who oppose our government, saying that all liberty left in Illyria will be gone within months. A Croat resistance force has popped up, a Republican paramilitary consisting of traitorous soldiers, officers, and citizens. Nobody knows anything about them, except that they oppose the rule of the government, and will most definitely try to keep it from taking away their freedoms."

cro.41.t: "The Enabling Act"
cro.41.d: "Due to the actions of pro-independence radicals and Socialists, the Government in Vienna and the domestic Illyrian Government has come together to make a broad series of reforms. These reforms will put the Nobles at the center of the government and tie our nation directly to Austria’s Sphere. This “Enabling Act” was passed through a slim vote and gave the new government a widespread series of powers to detain without trial, suppress the free press and other broad powers. Illyria has now been transformed into an Authoritarian State, and Austria is one step closer to being under direct Austrian Rule."

ill.6.d: "Although the Austro-Hungarian Empire has been on a razor's edge for decades now, its position tips ever closer to falling. Slovenia, long an integral part of Austria proper, has been petitioning entry into Illyria ever since its inception in the 1927 Ausgleich. Relations between the Austrians and Slovenes have reached a tipping point at last, as Slovenes threaten secession and rebellion if Austria does not listen to them. Relations between the Special Status Territory of Illyria and Austria have also been strained, as the Illyrian government supports the Slovenes. Talk spreads in Zagreb about the possibility of revolt. Meanwhile, the three other crowns of the Empire sit on the sidelines, wondering whether to secede themselves or stay in it to the end.\n This crisis came to an end when Austria has granted Slovenia’s wishes and transferred the region to Illyria.

Meanwhile, the three other crowns of the Empire sit on the sidelines, wondering whether to secede themselves or stay in it to the end. \n After Austria declared that they would keep Slovenia in their sphere, the entirety of both the Slovene and Illyrian delegation left the Ausgleich in protest. With these actions, it is clear to the entire Austrian sphere that the government does not care about their subjects. The crushing of the Slovene has demonstrated Austria’s oppression, and it becomes clear that if we do not slip from the Double Eagle’s Talons, we could be the next victim of Vienna’s will."

##### REIGN OF TERROR EVENTS #####

reign.1.t: "A Reign of Peace and Prosperity"
reign.1.d: "The Republic has ended. Our glorious military and the Nationalists at their side, famous for stamping out Austrian flames, is tired of the credit that the Republic itself took for beating Austria. The people were praised, not the military. It has all been undone now - our military of liberty has its place in the sun. Under Ante Pavelić, the Illyrian State will rule all the Southern Slavs in peace, held together by strength and teamwork, all under the face of Pavelić, the saviour and liberator of Illyria. All shall tremble under Illyria, all shall bow to it. All hail!"
reign.1.a: "Loyalty is required."

reign.2.t: "Crushing Political Opposition"
reign.2.d: "It seems some of these "citizens" haven't got the idea of peace and harmony. Dissent rules the places untouched by our fair hand, and even still anywhere the darkness is there is dissent. Syndicalists, Republicans, the lot - all seek to destroy the State. The first victim were the Republican politicians - ready to be exterminated. Republicans lay dead in our prisons, torched by our light - unable to convert. Next - the Syndicalists we suspected to exist, and especially, end that Tito once and for all... but there were none. Tito was gone. He and his Syndicalists are to return another day, the interrogated say..."
reign.2.a: "Where did Tito go?"

reign.3.t: "Those Rabid Bosnians!"
reign.3.d: "Bosnians. Rabid, berserk. Epitome of animals. But there is a process to re-humanize these rabid beasts, all with the light wielded by glorious Marshal Ante Pavelić. However, this was a mere theory. We tried on their soldiers we captured, except those animals threw curses and insults at our well-meaning officers. It is not possible to re-humanize Bosnians. We must come up with a new plan, and that plan is simply to put them out of this world, onto another world."
reign.3.a: "Put them down."

reign.4.t: "Ever-watching Slovenes"
reign.4.d: "Slovenia. Land of the always-watching eyes. Spies. You name it, if it can watch, they have it. And here they use it against us, calling our good regime "wicked" and "the most evil in the world". What they speak of is certainly not us, but their armies wage war against us. Those Slovenes have no idea who they are messing with, and when they do, it will be too late for them. They will be in the ditches they belong in, or without those all-seeing eyes. No Slovenian will make it out without reprisal."
reign.4.a: "Sever their eyes."

reign.5.t: "Traitors to Peace and Prosperity"
reign.5.d: "The worst case of all are those Southern "Croats". They are no Croats. They are traitors. They challenge the peace and prosperity we promise to the land of Illyria. When we kill one, another two appear. They are endless. But they aren't. Nothing is eternal, except the Illyrian State, and they don't seem to realize that. Soon enough they will submit to the bright lights, and be brought into the reign once and for all. These Republicans have no chance at winning whatsoever."
reign.5.a: "Punish them."

reign.6.t: "Pavelić's Personal Executioners"
reign.6.d: "Pavelić's Executioners. The most feared. The six and only six. They patrol the night, they end the worst anticitizens, they keep the peace, they rule Illyria with their velveted iron grip. Nobody can outrun them, play safe and the Executioners will not hurt you. Dissent, and your head will be on Pavelić's bedroom walls. The Executioners answer only to Pavelić. The sighting of one will send you whiter than a skeleton. Their aura promotes cooperation. Everyone except Pavelić must answer to the Executioners."
reign.6.a: "Only the worst face this axe."

reign.7.t: "Citizens Fleeing to Serbia"
reign.7.d: "These pesky dissenters have made an even more heinous crime today. They have attempted to leave Illyria, and flee to Serbia. Serbian authorities accept them and listen to their lies! It cannot continue. After we strike down our enemies, we will take back our population now in Serbia. Fleeing eastwards, through Bosnia, anywhere in the dark, that is where they go. They seek to run from us, but there is no hiding or running from light. Light will always find you. Serbians, consider this a warning."
reign.7.a: "Mistakes were made."

reign.8.t: "Terrified Croats at the Gates"
reign.8.d: "Frantic border officers have reported back to [SER.GetLeader] to tell him of the immense amounts of Croats attempting to get into our nation. They beg and plead; they seek to escape the armies of their State coming eastwards to retrieve them. Our border patrol officers have heard reports of genocide, death squads, arson, and dystopia. The king has let them in, to let them seek asylum in Serbia. The Illyrian State has denounced our actions, calling these dissenting Croats their property. The free world must hear about this, before the black tentacles of this revealed State reach us."
reign.8.a: "Dystopia in the Balkans."

reign.9.t: "The Propaganda Campaign"
reign.9.d: "Ah yes, propaganda. The way to get the masses to believe. It can be used for either good or for bad, and of course we're using it for good, to keep the dissidents away, or even better, to convert them. From the speakers of our cities, we see the conversion of the dissidents into loyal subjects of the State, loyal to Pavelić. It is a wonderful system, on the daily basis, none are able to hide or get away from our speakers, the sound of peace and prosperity. Cooperation is not recommended, it is required."
reign.9.a: "The only right answer is "yes sir!""

reign.10.t: "Death to Dissent"
reign.10.d: "Dissent. The enemy of progress, peace, and prosperity. Anticitizens are the root of all evil, and the only way to teach them a lesson is to show every other anticitizen their fate. In the streets, propaganda leaflets fly, and the crack of a rifle is heard every once in a while, to signify the death of yet another stain in the ranks of the pure, clean peoples of Illyria. Illyria is just for Illyrians; none others except our Slavs are permitted to be in our country. The bodies of the dead anticitizens rot and burn in piles, in heaps of dead to intimidate other potential wrongdoers of the eventual outcome of their dissent."
reign.10.a: "You aren't as safe as you think."

reign.11.t: "Our Beloved State"
reign.11.d: "It's done - the dissenting ranks are no more. All are loyal to Pavelić. Pavelić is supreme. Pavelić is eternal. All hail lord Pavelić! Not even the Powerful Military can stop Pavelic’s. And as the day draws longer, the Army stands down and allows Pavelić to completely control all of Illyria. The heaps of corpses burn no more and exist no more. Pavelic is no longer a figurehead for the Army. He is the State. Our citizens live in harmony, our nation prospers. §bNobody will ever find out what happened here.§!"
reign.11.a: "All hail Pavelić!"

reign.12.t: "The Black Earth"
reign.12.d: "The Earth is blackening as the fires lit by the military blaze and light camps, vehicles, and evils alike. They purge the evil, and reduce into ash, a material more worthy than they. They run in fear. Alight cities light the night sky, empty and smoldering.  Their sustenance burn, as does their will to keep fighting. As the fire burns brighter, so does the State's spirits. We are destined to win.  Eventually, the fauna and flora will have regenerated, and the world will be back to normal. Everything will be fine for us, but perhaps not for them - but that doesn’t matter one bit."
reign.12.a: "It is perfect for us."
