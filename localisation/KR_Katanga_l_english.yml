### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_PIERRE_RYCKMANS_DESC:0 "The Highborn Lord Pierre, 1st Graff Ryckmans, has served the Flandro-Wallonian government for most of his life, as has his family before him for generations back home in Flanders. Born in 1891, Ryckmans comes from a family of esteemed lawyers and politicians, with his father Alphonse serving as a prominent senator in the Flandro-Wallonian Senate as a member of the Catholic Party. His father’s views deeply impacted Ryckmans from a young age, going on to study philosophy at the Catholic University of Leuven before hopping around schools between Germany, Ireland, and Flanders-Wallonia before the horrors of the Weltkrieg began, inspiring him to voluntarily enlist. Originally assigned to the Yser Front, Ryckmans long held an idealized admiration for the Dark Continent and applied to transfer to the colonies for overseas service as soon as he was able. It was here on the battlefields of Africa that Ryckmans made a name for himself as a sound tactician and leader as he fought back against both European soldiers and Mwami warriors, paving the way for his future colonial career post-war. After briefly returning home to finish his law degree and to write and publish the first of his literary works and memoirs, Ryckmans returned to the Congo and was soon elected to become the mayor of Herminestadt - one of the Congo’s largest cities and the main administrative center in the colony. Now, having proven his effectiveness and worth, Pierre Ryckmans serves as Governor-General of the Congo Vrijstaat. Under his leadership, colonial rule shall be maintained at all costs as Ryckmans attempts to drag the ailing Vrijstaat into the modern era."
POLITICS_ALBERT_I_CONGO_DESC:0 "Albert I is known by many monikers: Le Roi-Chevalier, Der Koning-Soldaat, Heir to Leopold, and the Exiled King of the Flandro-Wallonians. These titles and honorifics have been bequeathed to him by his people’s adoration, his Godsent birthright, and his valorant acts in the Weltkrieg; and yet this noble ‘Soldier King’ has languished in exile while a German pretender sits on his throne. With the collapse of the previous colonial order under the ‘stewardship’ of the Kaiser’s forces, the Congo Vrijstaat has once again fully returned to the hands of its rightful Flandro-Wallonian masters, free from German meddling for the first time in decades. With this return of the proven pre-Weltkrieg status-quo, the Frandro-Wallonian loyalists within the Vrijstaat made overtures to their exiled king, who has long lived in Canada with the bulk of the Entente exiles, welcoming the Knight King Albert I back to the lands of Leopold’s free state and the center of the once mighty Flandro-Wallonian colonial empire. Though still far from Brussels and his throne, Albert I, rightful King of the Flandro-Wallonians, shall use the Congo as his new staging ground as he and his forces gather their strength to finally overthrow the vile German-backed regime that has stolen his homeland and his birthright from him. The mistakes of the Weltkrieg will be undone as Albert readies to fight for his people and his nation against the wicked Hun for the second time in his honored life."

KTG_Restoration_Missions:0 "Restoration of the Missions"
KTG_Restoration_Missions_desc:0 "Due to aggressive German policies against the power of the catholic church, many of our mission posts have been abandoned.

KTG_Elections_Herminestadt_desc:0 "The only way to consolidate power and satisfy our German overlords is to allow for free and fair elections within the colony.

KTG_Abolish_Invisible_Colour_Gap:0 "Abolish the Invisible Colour Gap"
KTG_Abolish_Invisible_Colour_Gap_desc:0 "While unlike the British or French colonies there never was a distinct colour gap in Congo, a glass ceiling blocked the Congolese from reaching high administrative or political positions.

KTG_Union_Miniere_Haut_Katanga_desc:0 "Not only is the UMHK the largest employer in our country, nearly all of economy relies on this company. Te secure a steady stream of income to the state, the UMHK is to be further integrated in the state and expanded upon."

KTG_Centre_Extra_Coutumiers_desc:0 "While the system of Chefferies worked well in the past, the growing population and the questionable loyalty of the cheffs has pushed the government to create their own economic centres on the countryside.

KTG_Monopolise_Agricultural_Companies:0 "Monopolise Agricultural Companies"
KTG_Monopolise_Agricultural_Companies_desc:0 "Currently our agricultural industry constitutes of farming quotas implaced on the villages and the collection of these whenever the district manager passes by the village.

KTG_Technical_University_Herminestadt_desc:0 "Due to the large growth of the UMHK over the last years, they have offered the government a large amount of funds to help in the creation of a technical university in Herminestadt.

KTG_Control_All_Aspects_of_Modern_Life:0 "Control all Aspects of Modern Life"
KTG_Control_All_Aspects_of_Modern_Life_desc:0 "The UMHK controls all aspects of its workers lives. They work in its mines, eat in its cantinas, buy their groceries in its stores. Housing is provided to all workers as well as support for the wife and children of the miner.

KTG_Embrace_Congolese_Belgian_Culture_desc:0 "Herminestadt has grown to become a hub for both Flemish-Wallonians and Katangese who all live next to each other.

KTG_Improve_Native_Living_Standards:0 "Improve Native Living Standards"
KTG_Improve_Native_Living_Standards_desc:0 "With jobs and pay equal for both natives and colonials, the overall welfare of the population has risen.

KTG_Learn_From_East_Africa_Offensive_desc:0 "While the initial campaigns of the FP proved successful against the German forces, the collapse of the British and the subsequent failure of the Western Front forced us in disbanding the corps.

KTG_Secure_Our_Investements:0 "Secure our Investments"
KTG_Secure_Our_Investements_desc:0 "We may have lost the Congo but we will not let African war chiefs undo all of our hard labour. If they cannot guarantee a free market, we will persuade them on the field."

KTG_Access_To_The_Sea_desc:0 "Our economy is primarily based around the sale and export of the various resources and materials extracted from the rich Congo. For this to continue, sea access is vital, but yet there is an obstacle to this goal - there is but one large seaport in all of the Congo. Unfortunately, recent developments in Leopoldville have left our main port at Matadi non operational. We must find a way to export our goods or else our fragile economy could slip further into collapse."

KTG_Luanda_Port:0 "The Port of Luanda"
KTG_Luanda_Port_desc:0 "The Portuguese have long controlled swathes of Africa. Currently, they control the Angolese port of Luanda, one of the largest colonial ports in Wesern-Central Africa. With this in mind, the Portuguese would be an excellent trading partner to subside our lack of a domestic seaport, if they accept our offer.

KTG_Pink_Map_Negotiations_desc:0 "With the evermore chaotic world situation developing as it has, Portugal has begun to pursue its old colonial claim to our region.

KTG_POR_Submission:0 "O Congo é Nosso"
KTG_POR_Submission_desc:0 "Despite protests from anti-imperialist elements within the nation, our regime has decided to work with the Portuguese. We have accepted Portuguese protection in exchange for broad autonomy and economic assistance. Let us reap the benefits of this controversial agreement and put our new funds to good use to build up the Congo with the help of our new benefactors, the Congo is now theirs as much as it is ours."

KTG_Herminestadt_Luanda_Railroad_desc:0 "Herminestadt and Portuguese Angola are separated by a mere few hundred miles of relatively clear and flat terrain - a practical stone’s throw away on this massive continent, and yet no rail connections exist. With our ample manpower reserves fueling our labour force and Portuguese financial backing funding the project, we shall have a rail line at last that connects Angola and Congo like never before, de-isolating our primordial paradise just a little more."

Self-sufficiency, local cooperation with other African states, and constructing our own native industry shall be key goals for our new economy.  What few funds we have should be directed, in partnership with our allies, towards the exploitation of the natural bounty of this land, for our own profit.

KTG_Recruit_Porters_Africa_Campaign_desc:0 "While we have access to technologies such as the steamboat and the railway, much of the continent is still only accessible on foot. Capable of carrying an average of about 55 pounds each while still maintaining their speed, endurance, and ability to traverse rough and rugged terrain, porters have always been a vital means of ferrying goods in Africa. They will be vital in supplying the campaign to retake the continent."

KTG_Economic_Dependency_MAF_desc:0 "It's undeniable that through our support of German and Flandro-Wallonian interests in Africa that we have found ourselves increasingly reliant on them to support our economy. This arrangement has reached critical mass, and we are now at a point where we are completely beholden to the Kaiserreich.

KTG_Full_Integration:0 "Total Integration into Mittelafrika"
KTG_Full_Integration_desc:0 "Full-reintegration into Mittelafrika is preferable to the uncertainties of independence.

KTG_Increased_Shipping_Capacity:0 "Expand the Congolese Merchant Marine"
KTG_Increased_Shipping_Capacity_desc:0 "In times of crisis, the merchant fleets of foreign nations could become unreliable as a means to carry our goods to the wider global market.

KTG_Congolese_Railroad_Expansion_desc:0 "Though we have endeavored greatly to build up the Congolese economy, our few cities and industrial centers are like islands dotting a sea of endless trees.

KTG_Diamond_Mines_Kivu_desc:0 "With our control over the region of Kivu being fully established, we have secured the exclusive right to exploit some of the world's most lucrative diamond mines. We should get started immediately and break ground on the known untapped deposits and seams while we expand the few current mines operating on-site. Additionally, we shall send new survey teams out into the surrounding jungles and hills to prospect for new sources. With these new diamond mines complimenting our already established gold and silver mining industries, the Congo shall become king of the mineral luxuries trade."

With our control over this region established, we have secured the exclusive right to cultivate the rubber trees here, in one of the most lucrative areas for rubber cultivation in Africa.

KTG_rallythecites:0 "Rally the Cities"

KTG_confiscatingcivillianvehicles_desc:0 "In times of war, we can not afford any luxuries, and neither can our populace.

KTG_salvagingthearsenals:0 "Salvage the Arsenals"
KTG_salvagingthearsenals_desc:0 "What little industry is still undamaged in our area of control must be used to produce and maintain weaponry for the war effort.

KTG_belgium_not_is_thing_desc:0 "Brussels has been lost, and the Flandro-Wallonian dream is dead - the homeland of our people owned by radicals or foreigners. With this harsh reality realized, our Vrijstaat is truly alone. Rather than cave at the idea of this isolation, we shall instead use it to our advantage.

KTG_leopold_larp_desc:0 "Leopold II, second King of the Flandro-Wallonians and first Sovereign of the Congo Vrijstaat, was a decisive figure to say the least. Though he started the Congo’s modernization and civilizing processes, turning the Congo into a profitable venture for rubber production, ivory sourcing, and mining, he did so through committing brutal acts against the native Congolese. Though harsh, Leopold II’s rule showed that in the Congo, profitable results required sacrifice, and so we will replicate his methods in a more modern and less barbaric way in order to further his civilizing mission here in the Congo."

Though the pursuit of good governance and greater profit is all well and good, they are nothing next to godliness.

The Congo shall be Christ’s kingdom in central Africa!"
KTG_invite_settlers:0 "Reignite the Settler Spirit"
KTG_invite_settlers_desc:0 "A fierce and undying colonial spirit is what founded these lands. Brave and hardy settlers came here from Flanders-Wallonia, Germany, and France, and established a new hold for the White Man in this Dark Heart of Africa. We must reignite this colonial spirit to further shore up our numbers and keep our dream alive. We have earned the right to rule these lands, and now we must fill it with our countrymen and our compatriots."

KTG_brand_new_army_desc:0 "The Force Publique is the last line of defense of sanity and civility in the Congo. Without their armed masses, we would be tossed to the wolves and torn apart by the savages and mongrels that stalk the African wilderness. The Force Publique shall become a key arm of the state, out-ranking many government and civilian institutions as an official branch of the government. From this lofty position, they shall be better able to protect our interests and newfound sovereignty without the impediments of lesser institutions, local tribal and village laws, and other red tape getting in the way."

From gold and silver to iron and uranium deposits to rubber tree forests that stretch for acres and underground deposits of oil and natural gas, the Congo is one of the most bountiful paradises on this planet - a true Eden on Earth. To ensure these resources are efficiently extracted and processed, the UMHK and other resource conglomerates in the Congo shall coalesce together into a central economic planning board, becoming an official arm of the state as the chief economic bureaucracy of the Congo. Only then, with these captains of industry working within our government officially, can the Congo truly and efficiently utilize this bounty we have been blessed with."

Though this alliance failed once, it will not fail again, for we and our fellow exiles know that our crusade is holy and righteous, for we shall not rest until the lands of our ancestors are cleansed of radicalism and foreign hegemonies.

KTG_conscript_natives_desc:0 "In the Weltkrieg, Africa saw vicious fighting and Congo was no exception. Nearly 30,000 African soldiers fought for the Congo in that horrific war, and it was with these native lives that the Congo lived and died with. Once again, we must rely on this colony's immense population to fuel the coming war effort and fill out our divisions. We must conscript the natives to work both in the factories and to hold a gun on the frontline, for without their manpower, our crusade to retake Brussels is doomed to fail.

Since then rubber plantations have grown to stretch across much of our colonies once-stocked and healthy rubber forests. Primarily in Bas-Congo, these plantations already stretch for hundreds of acres, producing liquid cash with each bucket of sap collected. We shall greatly expand the number of plantations we have, while also expanding the ones we already operate, to drastically increase our rubber output. Step aside Brazil, for Congo shall be the rubber capital of the world!"
KTG_mines:0 "Accelerate Congolese Mining"
KTG_mines_desc:0 "Mining for metals, rare-earth materials, and other bounties of the Earth’s crust has been what has brought the Congo most of its financial success, dwarfing even our famed rubber trade. Mining is so prevalent that companies like UMHK account for over 70% of our total economy, and as such, we would be fools to not expand this sector of our economy. Everything from new mines to new smelteries, foundries, and refining/processing plants shall be built not only in Katanga for the UMHK to monopolize, but across the Congo as a whole. Every profitable seam and crag of ore shall be mined and processed by our ever-growing industry!"

KTG_German_Influence:0 "The Iron Cross Looms Over the Congo"
KTG_German_Influence_desc:0 "With their victory in the Weltkrieg, Flanders-Wallonia and the Congo were forced to swear subservience to the new world hegemon. Though the Flandro-Wallonian administration in the Congo was allowed to stay and the reign of the Vrijstaat allowed to continue, the Kaiserreich quickly began to sink its greedy teeth into this resource-rich primordial oasis. With each passing moment, the German Empire further digs its claws into the Congo ever deeper, furthering their influence and fulfilling their own ambitions at the cost of the long-standing Flandro-Wallonian dominance that has existed since Leopold’s regime. Despite their best efforts, however, the influence of these Flandro-Wallonian imperialists and settlers is waning fast. \n\nThis atmosphere of crumbling chaos has come to minorly benefit the Congo, supplying the Force Publique with weapons and the colonial administration with economic aid, but has also greatly destabilized the colony and the very foundations of Flandro-Wallonian rule while also greatly inflaming native tensions who continue to riot and strike against colonial rule. An end to this struggle for dominance must be reached if the Vrijstaat is to survive at all."

#Belgian-German recolonisation effort

ktg.20.t:0 "The mwami has seized control!"
ktg.20.d:0 "Just as the tax collectors were returning from the inland territories and the miners of the Union Minière were enjoying a well deserved peaceful Sunday afternoon, news arrived in the capital that the Mwami of the [ROOT.GetName] people had deposed the German governor, executed his associates and taken control over the province.\n\nWith most of the populace still unaware of these shocking developments and having relatively content relations with the Flemish-Wallonian administration, this comes as a huge shock to the colonials. For over 50 years, the word of the white man was law and every form of disobedience was punished severely. Now a native king of a small village has dared standing up to their command and taken power into his own hands.\n\nA friendly football competition between the Flemish-Wallonians and the Katangese was just underway when news hit the city of Herminestadt. At first the citizens can't believe what they are hearing and life continues as normal. In the Colonial headquarters, chaos has erupted with a split occuring between those that want to stay and fight to preserve that which they have built up for years and those that want to leave the continent as quickly as possible. The bishop of the city can been seen speaking with the head of Askari forces stationed in the city and Pierre Ryckmans, mayor of the city. Should they try and escape the country now that German rule has faltered or should they entrench themselves in the white quarter protected by the loyal Askari forces?"
ktg.20.a:0 "Order a mass evacuation of the colony!"
ktg.20.b:0 "The Flemish-Wallonian administration stays put."

ktg.21.t:0 "Alone on the Dark Continent"
ktg.21.d:0 "With Ryckmans giving the order to entrench in the city of Herminestadt, the Katangese population finally realised what was going on. While a certain part of the population see the rebellion and fall of German rule as their chance at liberation from European rule, the majority of the city's population is less convinced by the arguments of their brothers. While their life in the city has not been easy, many remember the days of their tribal past and the hardships those brought with them. European rule may have been fierce and often unjust, but with it came a certain degree of welfare that many no longer want to abandon and have thus rallied behind the banner of the colonial administration.\n\nTables, chairs, cupboards and more furniture is being dragged onto the streets establishing temporary barricades while citizens from the suburbs are being transferred to the city plaza. Arms and medical supplies, many of which dating back from the Belgian era, are being taken from the kazernes and beds are rolled into the Herminestadt hospital. While many of the men, women and children have no fighting experience, hundreds of young miners, factory workers and colonial employees are being forced to take up arms to defend their families and city from the Mwamis army. Out of a total population of around 45.000 citizens, 35.000 have barricaded themselves with the Flemish-Wallonian forces while the rest has fled the city and taken shelter in the nearby villages. Only small bands of seperatists now remain outside the fortified centre and are plundering and sacking the outskirts of the city, taking their revenge on the évolués and properties of the whites in preparation of the arrival of the Mwamis forces."
ktg.21.a:0 "A soft rain is setting in."

ktg.22.t:0 "Mwami forces approach the city"
ktg.22.d:0 "Three days have passed since the killing of the governor and the collapse of German rule and forces of the Mwami are marching on Herminestadt to once and for all destroy any remainder of Colonial rule. Many of the villages along the road to Herminestadt have already picked their sides and have either sworn loyalty or have been sacked by his forces. Village after village the Mwami approaches the capital, whites from all surrounding villages and labourers of the Flemish-Wallonian companies have travelled to the city seeking refuge behind its barricade. Word of the resistance has been sent to Flanders-Wallonia to inform them of the Mwamis march but with infrastructure in shammbles after the Collapse and roving parties roaming the Congo basin, it has become apparent that no European aid will arrive in time."
ktg.22.a:0 "Finalise all preparations."

ktg.23.t:0 "The siege begins"
ktg.23.d:0 "On the evening of the first week, the mwami has finally reached the city. With rain still pouring down as if God himself has opened the flood gates, life inside the fortifications is becoming tougher with the day.\n\nUnder cover of darkness a perimeter is established surrounding the city by the Mwami while scouting parties are sent inside the outskirts to investigate the fortifications made by the Colonials. While the mwami is outnumbered by the population of Herminestadt, his army consists of trained warriors and disgruntled veterans from the East-Afrika offensive while the defenders only have a small 1000 soldiers armed with Weltkrieg weapons from the Force Publique and a couple of European officers. To frigthen the defenders, the Mwami has commanded a thousand fires to be lit around the city and has initiated a war chant dating back from the Lunda war, to show the colonials that the Stairs Expedition will be avenged with fire and blood."
ktg.23.a:0 "Tighten the perimeter!"

ktg.24.t:0 "Battle for Herminestadt"
ktg.24.d:0 "At 8.00 the Mwami finally gives the signal citizens of Herminestadt have anxiously awaited during the night. Horns are sounded, shouting intensifies and the first charge commences. The assaulting force, numbering over 5000 trained warriors from his capital in Bunkeya, storm through the main avenue while deserted Askari warriors cover their attack."
ktg.24.a:0 "Fix bayonets! Repel them at all cost!"

ktg.25.t:0 "The Mwami falls back"
ktg.25.d:0 "For over 12 hours now, the battle for Herminestadt has been raging with heavy casualties on both sides forcing both parties to fall back for now and cut their losses. While the blockade at the north side of Kamalondo got overrun just after the morning, a concentrated effort of German machine guns, ex-soldiers of the Force Publique and an armed citizen militia was able to reconquer the point just before the evening, thus preventing a major breakthrough in the neighbourhood. While much of the Southern suburbs got overrun in the assault, with parts of the city set ablaze to cover the retreat, the fight did not provide the Mwami the decisive victory he desired and needed for the morale of his soldiers. Even though casualties are hard to estimate with certain parts of the city still in active combat, Ryckmans has estimated casualties on his side to number upwards of 3000. Casualties in the loyal Askari force were quite minimal but the loss of squads in the reconquest of Kamalondo are taking their toll on the already limited force."
ktg.25.a:0 "The future is looking bleak."

ktg.26.t:0 "The Assault recommences"
ktg.26.d:0 "Throughout the rest of the week, the Mwami furiously resumed his attacks on the city, each subsequent attack proving less effective than the last. Seeing the resolve of the Lubumbashi populace and the firm leadership by the Colonial administration, desertion has started to spread through the ranks of the Mwamin causing severe issues to his supply lines and the morale of the remaining warriors. At last the Mwami, sees no other solution than to offer a ceasefire to Pierre Ryckmans. Upon agreement, he offers the Colonials the right to retain their autonomy and power over the city of Herminestadt, control over the mines of the UMHK and a continuation of the pre-Collapse policy as long as he is allowed to rule the Yeke kingdom from his seat in Bunkeya as he pleases."
ktg.26.a:0 "Accept the Ceasefire."

ktg.27.t:0 "End of the siege"
ktg.27.d:0 "With the last of the Mwamis forces leaving the city, the devastation caused by the siege has finally become apparent. Hundreds of houses are burned down, streets are blockaded by debris and thousands of brave Congolese and colonials lay unburied on the battlefield. This fight may be won but the recovery has only just begun."
ktg.27.a:0 "Colonial order is restored!"

ktg.29.t:0 "Appointement of the new colonial governor"
ktg.29.d:0 "After the passing of the previous governor in the chaos of the Mittel-Afrikan collapse, a new governor has to be appointed to rule over the Katanga province. While the Mwami will remain as the official ruler, he will only be used as a titular chieftain while the real power is held by the Colonial office and the UMHK. Due to his steadfast leadership and dedication in the siege, Pierre Ryckmans has unanimously been elected by the Colonial administration until further elections can be held. Although Ryckmans has showed contrary to many of his predecessors that he cares about the native population, the Katangese citizens are worried that a continuation of the old Belgian colonial policy is on hands."
ktg.29.b:0 "Good Luck Pierre Ryckmans!"

ktg.28.t:0 "Riots of Herminestadt"
ktg.28.d:0 "With the Mwami approaching the city, many of the formerly loyal inhabitants see their chance at true independence free from White oppression. Mass rioting breaks out with houses of colonials being plundered and set ablaze. Greek and Italian restaurants and shops are being set alight and the overseers at UMHK decapitated on the streets."
ktg.28.a:0 "Katanga will be independent!"

#Flanders-Wallonia
ktg.40.t:0 "Envoy from Katanga"
ktg.40.d:0 "Through a vast communications network sustained by the catholic church in Congo, news has reached us over the situation of our former colony. Through clever use of the Force Publique and by utilising the population of Herminestadt, the colonial government under Pierre Ryckmans was able to hold on to colonial rule. Now, a formal request has been made by his government for support from our country. In the chaos that ensued after Black Monday, most of our citizens living and working in the Congo were able to escape to Herminestadt where the central power of our mining operations is located. Reports from the missions indicate that around 10.000 of our colonials were able to retreat to Herminestadt where they proclaimed Pierre Ryckmans as their colonial governor. While our government isn't able to launch a full scale offensive to liberate our citizens, the colonials have requested that we sent them weapons, ammunition and food supplies so they can hold off the African war chiefs."

Due to our ambitions to take over the region and our access to the ports of the Atlantic Ocean, the colonial government under Pierre Ryckmans has offered us a trade agreement where we would allow them to use our ports and railroads in exchange for heavy tarrifs.

ktg.71.d:0 "The Mwami and his forces have long been a thorn in the side of the Vrijstaat, but Pierre Ryckmans has long fought to extinguish this native movement and capture its troublesome tribal king. Though Ryckmans has widely succeeded in his first goal, with the Mwami’s forces now largely on the run and hiding out in Katanga, the Mwami still evades his capture and has joined his fleeing troops. \n\nAfter this victory over the Mwami, the reinstated colonial government under Pierre Ryckmans has proceeded on their path to consolidate the colonial regime. As the Mwami licks his wounds in Bunkeya and with the support of the Herminestadt and Leopoldville populations, a formal letter has been sent to the Mwami informing him that his ‘services’ are no longer necessary for Katanga and that he has been officially stripped of all his titles and stance as a paramount chief. This will surely upset his most loyal followers, but after their defeat, it shall hopefully only require some careful precision strikes by the Force Publique and Flemish-Wallonian special forces to extinguish their flame of resistance."

ktg.72.d:0 "Word has returned from Bunkeya where the Mwami, outraged by our demands, has ripped apart our letter stripping him of his titles and has instead given the order to remobilize his forces. Due to their loss in Herminestadt earlier this year, his troops are widely undersupplied and lacking in even the most basic of equipment. Meanwhile, the Force Publique, though still widely armed with Weltkrieg-era weapons, has been preparing their assault unit while paracommandos and marines from Flanders-Wallonia landed in Herminestadt and Leopoldville earlier today."

Meanwhile, the first trucks loaded with our troops have arrived in Bunkeya and the city has been mostly secured. A temporary airstrip has been created to accommodate the incoming Flandro-Wallonian paracommandos while a new plan of action is being formalised by the general staff of the Force Publique."

In response to this decision and our forces growing anger over the loss of their fellow comrades in the Force Publique, General Tombeur had given the order to bomb the Munema fortress and follow up with a combined push by Flemish-Wallonian paracommandos and Force Publique foot soldiers. The ancient fortress was surely not at all capable of resisting this type of modern, combined warfare and was expected to fall within hours. However, in our foolish overconfidence, we had ordered our forces to wait to advance for the moment our bombs stopped falling on the old fortress, and in this brief window, the Mwami and a small detachment of his vanguard and closest advisors were able to slip away in old tunnels beneath the surface. The Mwami’s forces are routed, but this slippery chief has escaped our grasp once more. Regardless, his movement is too fractured to be any threat now."

Organised by père Raphaël de la Kethulle football matches and small championships are held throughout Herminestadt. Through growing mining cités and the continued education policy of our governor, the père hopes to improve social promotion of the Africans and has requested the government to further expand his vision by the creation of the Association Sportive Congolaise."

To further strengthen the bonds between the two organisations, the Beerschot club has announced their visit to Herminestadt to face off against the best of our nation.

Due to the père hundreds of Katangese school children have volunteered to aid in the construction as well hoping to one day be able to become world stars and play in the Flemish-Wallonian league.

Accompanied by loud music and even a performance of the Force Publique orchestra, the stadium has started to fill up with more than 50.000 Katangese already inside and more than 20.000 waiting outside. With a burning sun shining on the supporters, the match began with a goal from Mokuna against the Flemish-Wallonian keeper. The Beerschot attackers were able to turn the tide around at the 42 minute mark scoring two goals against the failing Herminestadt defence, placing the score 2-1 at half-time. During the second half, three more attacks by Beerschot were blocked by the Herminestadt defence and Mokuna was able to score another goal at the 76 minute placing the final score at 2-2. Ecstatic with the beautiful performance their team was able to present the Flemish-Wallonians, celebrations continued deep into the night together with the Beerschot supporters."

She countered that due to the reforms pushed by UMHK after the Black Monday scandal, many of the workers can't afford their life necessities anymore and that she resulted in stealing to sustain her family.

ktgfla.6.d:0 "A study in the Herminestadt paper has been published outlining the atrocities committed by the UMHK against the Hutu population of Rwanda. By promising them wealth and success, many unemployed men have travelled to Herminestadt to be employed in the mines. Insisting that they are naturally protected against low oxygen environments due to their mountainous home and don't need the 'Chambres à Vapeur' to acclimate to the situation down below, many of these men have died from loss of oxygen or malaria and secretly buried away from the general public. Now the study has leaked out to the population of Herminestadt resulting in a massive strike against the UMHK until better working conditions can be guaranteed. Over in the Colonial government, debate is also occurring over the replacement of the Chefs in the mine of question to deter exploding anti-colonialist thoughts."

ktgfla.7.d:0 "In continuation of the pre-Weltkrieg colonial policy, the UMHK has once again dedicated itself to a combination of complex bureaucracy and a general patronising attitude towards it's workers. Due to the expansion of the corporation over the years however this combination is no longer viable for the entire firm leading to loopholes and unjustified punitive measures against the wrong miner. After the economic crisis of 1936, many of the miners are now completely at the mercy of the company, depending on them for food, social facilities, accomodation. To cut back their losses, the UMHK decided to cut back spending for these facilities, causing a general decline in the welfare of the Katangese and increasing calls for better loans and houses now that the economy is back in upswing."

In Herminestadt, the situation is escalating with multiple shops and cafes run by colonials getting thrashed and a general strike in the UMHK. The colonial government is debating whether to take this opportunity to finally complete the nationalisation of the UMHK, forcing the company to directly change its policy and offer better working conditions to the native workforce."

Due to a planned visit to Bunkeya however, Pierre Ryckmans wasn't able to meet with the strikers and has sent his deputy Amour Maron to handle the situation. When Léonard Mpoyi and his colleagues however started presenting their evidence to the gathered council, Amour Maron shot the man next to Mpoyi point blank and ordered the Force Publique to open fire on the strikers. Over 50 miners were shot dead with hundreds of wounded. The strike has been quelled but for how long...?"

It's unclear who could have targeted the much adored père who was responsible for the introduction of football in the colony but reports indicate that a radical member of the [ROOT.GetName] tribe may have detonated the bomb to express his distrust of the ever increasing power of the Catholic Church. His attempt seemed to have caused the opposite with more and more citizens deciding to abandon their tribal past and become part of the growing population of évolués in the cities."

Within our own borders, various seperatist movements have taken the opportunity to revolt against our rightful rule! To the north in Coquilhatville, a mercenary state rises to oppose our rule, while to the east, the Kivu Clique and the native Congolese seek to throw off the shackles of colonialism. Seizing on this moment of weakness, Leopoldsville to the west has seceded, taking our only sea access with them, while the Miners Union of the south jungles have declared autonomy from our administration to further their own interests.

conbel.2.d:0 "Bunkeya, the faltering jewel of the Garanganze people, lies nestled deep within the Congo-Vrijstaat's southern jungles. Once a bustling center of trade and culture during the reign of the Yeke Kingdom, Bunkeya has long since stagnated in its fall from prosperity. The rule of the joint Flandro-Wallonian-German mission has cast a dark cloud over the colony. Though these Europeans brought the light of civilization, with all of its accompanying technologies and accouterments, they have also brought death and decay. The colony and its native people are overworked by its overseers who use the natives as cheap labor, harvesting the vast natural and mineral riches of the Congo. Though this system has created vast amounts of material wealth for the Flandro-Wallonians, and for Mitteleuropa as a whole, it has also drawn the ire of many natives in the colony. Most prominent among the dissidents of the colonial regime is the Mwami and his loyal followers. The Mwami is the local, rightful ruler to these lands in the eyes of the natives, and his insurrectionary activities continue to be a thorn in the side of our administration and threaten the very stability of our stake here. Before it is too late, a direction must be chosen if the colony is to survive. Whether we crush the Mwami or decide to tolerate their existence, we must be certain it is the correct path. Despite the growing dark clouds on the horizon, both here in the colony and back home on the European mainland, our colonial government must steer itself on a direct and measured course if it is to survive the coming storm."

conbel.3.d:0 "After much deliberation, our administration has begrudgingly come to the decision to approach the Mwami and his forces with some semblance of respect and poise in order to peacefully hammer out a resolution to our current conflict. To achieve this admirable goal, we have called "His Highness" to our colonial capital so we may discuss terms for peace. If these peace talks get anywhere, however, remains to be seen..."

Across the colony, sighs of relief are heard and celebrations grow wild as peace and hope has been brought to our slice of the Dark Continent. Now, any conflict we face, we shall face together."

conbel.5.d:0 "We have received word from our subordinate colony of the Congo-Vrijstaat. For months, Pierre Ryckmans and his administration have fought tooth and nail with the Mwami of the southern Congo in Garanganze. Time and time again, peace talks have almost succeeded, only for such hopes to be dashed by another rise in violent conflict: the region has not known peace or stability for what feels like ages. Finally, through either compromise or force, the last of the Mwami’s forces have been quelled, and it seems peace has been brought to the Congo once more. Whether this peace will last, however, is yet to be seen."

conbel.6.t:0 "Congo Has Rewarded the Évolues"
conbel.6.d:0 "Within the Congo colony, a certain class of natives who have shown a commendable level of skill and value in their service to the colony exists: the Évolues. Functioning as a sort of "middle-class" in the colony, the Évolues complete vital functions key to keeping the colony running, from fields such as nursing to engineering. In recognition of their great and patriotic service to the Flanders-Wallonian colonial empire, the Évolues of the Congo colony have finally been awarded for their long and unwavering service. Their reward shall take the form of better housing, better pay, and greater freedoms and rights within the colony. They will also be granted representatives in the colonial congress who, while holding no voting power, can act as observers so the native voice can at least be heard in colonial meetings. Though our more cynical citizens see this as no more than a master petting its obedient dogs, others view this as a small but important step on the road to African self-determination."
conbel.6.a:0 "How quaint."

conbel.7.t:0 "Heinous Treachery!"
conbel.7.d:0 "It seems our recent dealings with the Mwami have angered the more conservative elements of our colonial administration. With the news of our new peace deal with the natives reverberating throughout the colony, it seems the mining concerns and their lobbyists and cronies in the capital have risen up and declared our current government dead. These rebels claim the current administration has kowtowed to the Mwami and his followers for too long and seek to continue their operations outside of our oversight. They have seized parts of the capital as well as their mining and harvesting operations across the colony and refuse to deescalate the situation. In response, our cabinet has come up with three possible solutions to our problems. The first and most obviously detrimental option is to simply do nothing and let these rebels continue their operations in peace, with proponents for this plan claiming tensions will cool in the coming weeks and that direct military action would be too hasty or drastic. Alternatively, the main opposition to this plan is to ride out and crush this insurrection now before it can grow out of hand. However, among this faction, two different camps have emerged. The first camp seeks to use only the colonial garrison force to crush these rebels, with its followers putting full faith in our garrison to be able to defeat these well-funded partisans. The other camp, seemingly seeing the writing on the wall, has declared that only with Mwami cooperation under a united front can these rebels be fully crushed. The debate raged far into the next morning but by the end of the conference, a clear victor stood among the factions."

Now victorious, our forces may lick their wounds as we work to rebuild our nation that lies nestled in the heart of the Dark Continent. While moving towards reconstruction, the question of our international alignment has come up numerous times, and many in our administration feel that we will need allies in order to maintain order and security. However, a small, stalwart clique in our government still maintains that the Congo needs no ally or hegemon, and that our best possible future lies in our hands and our hands alone."

conbel.10.d:0 "With the ever-destabilizing situation growing worse in our Vrijstaat with each passing moment, the people of our colony have increasingly called for a new Governor-General election to be held. With faith in Ryckmans’ regime faltering with each misstep in policy or each new native riot that breaks out, many within the colonial administration and settler population wish to wipe clean the current administration and replace it with a more competent one. However, Ryckmans has long stood as a stalwart defender of Congolese interests over favoring either Berlin or Brussels, and if he were to be voted out, the Vrijstaat would likely greatly swing towards one of these two benefactors for aid and legitimacy. \n\nTo replace Ryckmans stands two main alternatives, each pursuing their own agendas. Fighting for increased German interests and control in the Congo is the famed Franz Ritter von Epp, hero of the Weltkrieg and Knight of the German Empire. Under his rule, the Vrijstaat would work towards closer cooperation and even possible full integration into the wider Mittelafrikan patchwork itself, giving the Kaiserreich full access to the Congo’s riches. Alternatively, the Flandro-Wallonian candidate is someone far less controversial than this Kraut - the Force Publique commander Léo Pétillon. Pétillon stands as a staunch pro-Flandro-Wallonian nationalist and minor technocrat - the perfect scion to unleash upon this unruly colony. Whoever is chosen, they will be shouldered with the immense responsibility of administering the Dark Heart of Africa."
