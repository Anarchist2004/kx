### Set Up Events - Haywood ###
amcivwar.1.t: "President Haywood Escapes to Chicago"
amcivwar.1.d: "President Haywood has escaped to Chicago and declared that MacArthur is a traitor to all the people of America. His calls have gained a great deal of support in the Steel Belt, and a number of governors have already announced that they do not recognize the 'illegitimate' authority of the current government. They have closed off their borders to American soldiers, raising a chilling specter of the civil war the country experienced less than a century ago."
amcivwar.1.a: "The disaster has begun. Stand by the Republic"
amcivwar.1.b: "The revolution has begun. Stand by the Workers (Play as the CSA)"

amcivwar.1001.t: "Old Democrats Revolt"
amcivwar.1001.d: "William H. Murray has given a speech that he will not stand for leftist tyranny, racial degeneration, and federal corruption that lead to the empowerment of the CSA and the rise of the anti-Klan MacArthur. On behalf of the Old Democrats and all 'fellow true-blooded Americans' he declared a formal revolt for liberty, morality and White protestantism. Throughout the American Southeast the Old Democrat and White League aligned governors and militias are signing a Manifesto in favor of a fully 'Constitutional American Republic' that does not trample the heritage of the American people and fights against socialist immorality. White Leagues are currently attempting to maintain control of the border states that make up this new state before the Federal government, Minutemen and socialists attack."
amcivwar.1001.a: "The disaster has begun. Stand by the Republic"
amcivwar.1001.b: "Stand by the Nation (Play as the CAR)"

amcivwar.2.t: "Huey Long Declares the American Union State"
amcivwar.2.d: "In a fiery speech in New Orleans, Huey Long has spoken about the need to fight both the traitor MacArthur and other "anti-American" pretenders such as William H. Murray and the revolutionary socialists. All are tyrants that need to be toppled, and only the AFP, under his guidance, can cleanse America. He has gained ready listeners among a number of southern and Mid-Western governors whom already form his populist-progressive alliance in Congress and have awaited a chance to empower farmers, all of whom have recognized that they recognize the authority of neither MacArthur nor President Haywood."
amcivwar.2.a: "Stand by the Republic"
amcivwar.2.b: "Stand by the Country (Play as the AUS)"

amcivwar.3.t: "Pacific Governors Declare Emergency"
amcivwar.3.d: "The governors of the Pacific states have declared that MacArthur is an enemy of America alongside other anti-democratic demagogues. They currently have not seceded from the Union, but instead desire the creation of a military force to counter-act MacArthur's Eastern Junta. California Governor Frank Merriam announced at the Sacramento legislature that, if push came to shove, they would see 'proper democracy' restored to the country by force."
amcivwar.3.a: "Stand by the Government"
amcivwar.3.b: "Stand by the Republic (Play as the PSA)"

amcivwar.3000.t: "The Western Command Center Established"
amcivwar.3000.d: "Generals Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower are commanding Federal forces in the West and are reporting that it is too dangerous to gain supplies and orders from Washington at this point in time due to the sheer size and forces making up the American Union State, Combined Syndicates of America and Constitutional American Republic. Worse yet the formation of the Pacific States has made the defense of the West even more urgent and the Federal government can not afford to grant even more access to the resources of the West to these various traitors. As such the Western Command Center has been formed under Bradley and Eisenhower to fight the forces that would see them tried for standing by the army and attempting to restore order. However, it is rumored that the WCC may have been partially formed by Bradley and Eisenhower's desire for autonomy from MacArthur while defending the Federal Government. Regardless hopefully this new base of operations will bring the Pacific States to see reason and reconsider their course of action."
amcivwar.3000.a: "Stand by the Government"
amcivwar.3000.b: "Stand by the Army (Play as the WCC)"

amcivwar.3001.t: "Black Belt Revolts"
amcivwar.3001.d: "The Black Belt has finally organized a coup against the ODP in Black Heavy regions under the combined strength of socialist, nationalist liberal militias after a proclamation from their supposed 'capital' in Birmingham after militias took the city. W.E.B. DuBois has entered as the rogue nations nominal leader, and already we will need to go to war with them to prevent them from stabbing us in the back."
amcivwar.3001.a: "Damn them!"
amcivwar.3001.b: "About time!"

amcivwar.3002.t: "Black Belt Revolts"
amcivwar.3002.d: "The Black Belt has finally organized a coup against the ODP in Black Heavy regions under the combined strength of socialist, nationalist liberal militias after a proclamation from their supposed 'capital' in Birmingham after militias took the city. W.E.B. DuBois has entered as the rogue nations nominal leader, and already we will need to go to war with them to prevent them from stabbing us in the back."

amcivwar.3002.b: "About time!"

amcivwar.3003.t: "Integration of the Black Belt Revolt?"

The demand states that if we do not fall in line behind the General within the next few days, they will deem us traitors and launch an all-out attack against our territories. MacArthur's message has not been well recieved by almost every member of our cabinet. Most view this as message as a threat to our revolt, and caution that loyalty to MacArthur may return us to conditions equal to those we endured under Murray and possibly even Simmons.

amcivwar.4.t: "Standoff in America"
amcivwar.4.d: "A tense standoff has erupted in the United States, as democratically-elected President Haywood fled to the city of Chicago after being forcibly removed from his position by General Douglas MacArthur after the Old Democrats practically announced a revolt when his victory was announced. From Chicago, Haywood's supporters have declared MacArthur's government illegitimate - as have the populist supporters of Huey Long, based in New Orleans, and the Pacific Congress in the West and given a deadline by General MacArthur of thirty days to either stand down or face arrest and execution. Considering all sides are rapidly raising forces, the idea that America seems headed into a second civil war seems almost certain."
amcivwar.4.a: "I see"

amcivwar.4000.t: "Reach out to the Victor?"
amcivwar.4000.d: "While only winning the presidency due to the House of Representatives, Haywood is nonetheless a technically democratically-elected president. Given his revolutionary rhetoric against the "Capitalist" system however it seems he is now willing to pursue an anti-constitutional means of implementing his program before he's even been inaugurated so going to war with him would not be unjustifiable to our population. Nonetheless is would bolster our moral position if he was offered a passive alliance in return for recognizing the United States Constitution, including allowing the Supreme Court to review his laws even it's unlikely he would agree to such checks on socialist reforms."
amcivwar.4000.a: "We should at least try"
amcivwar.4000.b: "We don't negotiate with tyrants"

amcivwar.4001.t: "PSA offers peace?"
amcivwar.4001.d: "The Pacific States of America has decided to recognize that we are the victors of the 1936 election and that, therefore, they are willing to ally us. However, this would come at the cost of having to agree to be constrained by their laws and constitution which many of our followers believe to have been perversed to serve the bourgeoisie and would likely not go over well with our more hardline supporters. However there is no doubt their aid would be helpful and our 'Social Patriotic' faction made up largely of the AFL and the Independent League of America fanatically wants us to accept the deal despite most syndicalists denouncing it."
amcivwar.4001.a: "Nonsense"
amcivwar.4001.b: "We must accept"

amcivwar.4002.t: "Offer declined"
amcivwar.4002.d: "Unsurprisingly our offer has been declined though we can at least say we tried to achieve peace through reason."
amcivwar.4002.a: "A crying shame"

amcivwar.4003.t: "Offer Accepted!"
amcivwar.4003.d: "Shockingly despite his reputation as a fanatic Haywood has accepted our offer of a temporary ceasefire. However it is clear hardliners in the SPA are not happy with this arrangement making it questionable if it will last for long. Likewise there is a backlash from of our own politicians and citizens in response to the deal, particularly on the political right-wing, some of whom now refuse to serve in our forces."
amcivwar.4003.a: "Well it's better than not having it"

amcivwar.4004.t: "Reach out to Long?"
amcivwar.4004.d: "While many in our Republic are no fans of Huey Long, he is basically the least radical of the governments that have formed and at least pays lip service to restoring the Constitution. Should we try to reach out to achieve a truce in the face of our common enemy in the Western Command Center? Of course it is likely to be met with strong opposition from those who feel strongly against the man and that he's just another radical that needs to be stopped, and offering could cause a handful to not serve and parts of Congress to get in an uproar."
amcivwar.4004.a: "Do it"
amcivwar.4004.b: "Long will need to surrender as well"

amcivwar.4005.t: "PSA offers peace?"
amcivwar.4005.d: "We have just received an offer of alliance from the Pacific States of America, a faction we have shown ambiguity towards until now. They have stated that since we both stand for democracy and the United States we should ally against the WCC and other factions. Of course they are pressuring Huey Long to accept the guidelines of the Constitution and existence of Western oligarchs, and elites of both the PSA and AUS are suspicious of one another. Nonetheless, Long has justified his proposals by stating they are constitutional so their ideology is not incompatible with ours. We would need a guarantee of course for a new election right after the war, and some support for Share Our Wealth would be thoughtful as well to calm the AFP at home. In this way the AFP may grow so long as we win the war."
amcivwar.4005.a: "Yes, send the offer"
amcivwar.4005.b: "I don't trust snakes"

amcivwar.4006.t: "Long's Demands"
amcivwar.4006.d: "Long has received our offer and has agreed to be constrained by the Constitution. However he has demanded that a national election be held as soon as the region is reunited, desires benefits for the Share the Wealth Society within our territory and has called on the PSA leadership to announce that Long is doing all he can to save American Democracy and to allow recruitment within their territory. It seems even in a time of war the Kingfish still has political maneuvering on the mind."
amcivwar.4006.a: "Still accept"
amcivwar.4006.b: "Screw this, withdraw our offer"

amcivwar.4007.t: "The West Accepts"
amcivwar.4007.d: "We have secured an alliance with the PSA despite naysayers within both Republics denouncing the move. We can now work with them towards destroying the so-called 'Western Command Center' of Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower, relieving us of forces that can now be used further East."
amcivwar.4007.a: "I've outdone myself!"

amcivwar.4008.t: "The Pacific States denounces us!"
amcivwar.4008.d: "The Western oligarchs and bureaucrats have, perhaps expectedly, denounced our attempts to help the people despite the relatively low-cost of our requests in return for peace. Calling Long an "opportunist", they seem deadset on forcing all other Americans to bend the knee and arrogantly refuse to recognize our government as legitimate, demanding we hand over our forces at once."
amcivwar.4008.a: "Finance resist us to the end"

amcivwar.4009.t: "Talk down the CSA?"
amcivwar.4009.d: "Despite the Red Guard and the Minutemen not being exactly on the best terms and indeed even having fought each other in the past the fact that in Congress the AFP and its allies have voted on similar bills as the SPA has lead to some positive communication between the two on the higher levels and now might be the time to us those connections. With us already having to deal with the WCC and the extremely hostile CAR our military staff warns us we are overstretched and a left-wing member of our alliance, Maury Maverick, has offered to go to the CSA and offer a peace treaty, as they directly border the USA and would benefit from working with us. Of course Charles Coughlin, Silver Legion leader William Dudley Pelley and most of all Gerald L.K. Smith is opposed to the plan, claiming it would cause AUS boys to distrust Long and that leftists are our enemy as much as the anti-Share the Wealth CAR and Federalist WCC is."
amcivwar.4009.a: "Send Maverick"
amcivwar.4009.b: "They are our enemy as well"

amcivwar.4010.t: "AUS Peace offer?"
amcivwar.4010.d: "The Longist Coalition that makes up the AUS has sent us a peace offer in the form of Maury Maverick whom claims that not only should the CSA and AUS work together for the sake of survival but that we have more in common than both sides acknowledge. While it is likely Long has only sent this delegation in the hopes of relieving his military's front line when it likely comes to full war between him and the CAR and WCC it is also true that we are not in a much better position thanks to MacArthur being on our east side and the CAR targeting us especially for destruction. Syndicalists are not enthusiastic and the 'Syndicalist-Collectivist' TUUC leader William Z. Foster are denouncing the deal as a pointless concession to 'social capitalism' as the CSA will need to defeat them anyways but the Social Patriots in Congress are pushing for it. We could accept this for a time but it is likely the syndicalist side of Congress will eventually tear down the deal if they have their way."
amcivwar.4010.a: "We must accept for now"
amcivwar.4010.b: "We don't negotiate with opportunists"

amcivwar.4011.t: "CSA declines!"
amcivwar.4011.d: "In a move that may see us both dead the CSA has declined the offer, vindicating the right-wing of the AUS. Maverick himself is in shambles and the military is attempting to raise additional troops in the North by calling the CSA warmongers with meager results."
amcivwar.4011.a: "Fools may have doomed us both!"

amcivwar.4012.t: "CSA Accepts!"
amcivwar.4012.d: "The CSA has accepted the deal! We can now move troops accordingly to fully account for the WCC and CAR. Of course Maverick warns that the syndicalist and ultra-radicals in the CSA were opposed to the deal and it could break down in the future."
amcivwar.4012.a: "It will have to do!"

amcivwar.4013.t: "Long Declines!"
amcivwar.4013.d: "Long essentially wants us to be absorbed by his cause which our political class will absolutely class. As such war with him appears inevitable."
amcivwar.4013.a: "Damn him!"

amcivwar.4014.t: "Radicals Oppose Treaty!"
amcivwar.4014.d: "WIth the Social Patriots losing the internal struggle for power in the Congress, The Radicals within our Congress increasingly oppose the treaty with Long as we appear to be defeating the CAR. As such, they press us to destroy him since there is no compromise that revolutionary socialists can make with a capitalist power competing for the same territory, noting that if we don't attack him first he will inevitably anyways and endanger the future of the revolution. We could use our remaining political power to buy time within the Congress however, albeit no more than a week or two."
amcivwar.4014.a: "Prolong the Treaty for a bit"
amcivwar.4014.b: "Attack now!"

amcivwar.4015.t: "CSA Treaty Collapsing!"
amcivwar.4015.d: "Developments have reached us on the resolution of the CSA's domestic politiical debates which appears to have come out in favor of the Radical Syndicalists. As such our advisors note that the faction most hostile to the treaty has essentially ceased power and the treaty is liable to break down the moment we are no longer a useful ally."
amcivwar.4015.a: "Damn!"
amcivwar.4015.b: "Attack them now then!"

amcivwar.4016.t: "Congress Absolves Treaty!"
amcivwar.4016.d: "The revolutionary Congress has absolved the treaty completely and declared a revolution against the petit-bourgeoisie American Union State which they call 'a cesspool of faux-populist demagoguery and reaction cloaking itself as progressivism. As such we are at war with the American Union State."
amcivwar.4016.a: "The American Revolution is imminent!"

amcivwar.4017.t: "Treaty with the US?"
amcivwar.4017.d: "Despite our dislike of the anti-ODP and anti-NDWL MacArthurist regime we are clearly at a disadvantage now that the CSA and AUS has signed a peace treaty. Due to this Theodore Bilbo has drawn up the 200 days plan which will grant us a 200 day non-aggression pact with the United States before we supposedly negotiate a different deal or they peacefullly recognize our superiority."
amcivwar.4017.a: "Send Bilbo"
amcivwar.4017.b: "No, they fall now"

amcivwar.4018.t: "CAR treaty?"
amcivwar.4018.d: "In light of the CSA and AUS having recently decided to sign a non-aggression pact, CAR minister Theodore Bilbo has come to us with his 200 day plan which will guarantee peace between our nations for 200 days before we re-negotiate. Despite our hatred of the CAR this might be for the best, and Richard K. Sutherland is offering to negotiae with and finalize the agreement with Bilbo."
amcivwar.4018.a: "We must agree"
amcivwar.4018.b: "We don't negotiate with terrorists"

amcivwar.4019.t: "The US accepts!"
amcivwar.4019.d: "The United States has accepted the ceasefire, although given their reluctance it seems unlikely we can maintain it after the ceasefire date."
amcivwar.4019.a: "Very well"

amcivwar.4020.t: "The US declines!"
amcivwar.4020.d: "The USA has declined, demanding we rejoin them at once. War is seemingly inevitable."
amcivwar.4020.a: "Damn"

amcivwar.4021.t: "Treaty comes to an end"
amcivwar.4021.d: "As our ceasefire with the USA comes to an end it is fairly clear that both of us expect the other to bend the knee to the other at some point. As there are increasing border skirmishes between us in preparation for battle, it is time to attack before they do."
amcivwar.4021.a: "Attack"

amcivwar.4022.t: "Long Accepts!"
amcivwar.4022.d: "Long has accepted our offer of a non-aggression pact, and we will now combine our forces against the reactionary forces that surround us on all sides!"
amcivwar.4022.a: "Very well!"

amcivwar.5.t: "The Second Civil War"
amcivwar.5.d: "The federal government's deadline has come and gone, and with large militia forces having been raised on every side it is clear what their answer truly is. The Second American Civil War has begun."
amcivwar.5.a: "Not again..."

amcivwar.5000.t: "Last Men Standing!"
amcivwar.5000.d.AUSPSA: "The AUS and PSA are the last major governments standing from the ACW participants as each side has stuck to their respective treaties. The question now remains what to do to unite America as both sides view themselves as the legitimate American Government. Our diplomats have offered to send the AUS a treaty that would allow for a national referendum to settle the debate so long as both sides allow the constitution to restrain them upon victory. The referendum offer would require voting oversight boards to help prevent tampering and that the losing side would be given more autonomy compared to the pre-war period to run their region more in-line with their own beliefs. As most of Congress is a shell in the recently conquered areas, the referendum would use proportional representation to decide the number of appointees in these regions, allowing the victor a chance to enact their agenda. On the other hand, those such as a General DeWitt and Democratic Party leader Charles Martin believe Long is little more than a demagogue and to give him an opportunity to become President after the Civil War Disaster, which they partially lay at his feet, would be immoral. Instead they would have us demand he stand down."
amcivwar.5000.d.AUSPSACSA: "The AUS, CSA and PSA are the last major governments standing from the ACW participants as each side has stuck to their respective treaties.

As most of Congress is a shell in the recently conquered areas, the referendum would use proportional representation to decide the number of appointees in these regions, allowing the victor a chance to enact their major agenda alongside the fact that the Supreme Court needs numerous new appointees. On the other hand, much of Congress believes these governments are little more than radicals that only stood by us out of pragmatism and we must demand they stand down for if they won the referendum the war would have been for naught despite others arguing the peaceful resolution of America through democracy is well within our traditions."

As most of Congress is a shell in the recently conquered areas, the referendum would use proportional representation to decide the number of appointees in these regions, allowing the victor a chance to enact their agenda. On the other hand, a great many believe the CSA is still made up of fanatics partially responsible for starting the war in the first place despite claiming internal reform and refuse to bend the knee to them if they won the referendum, instead saying we should demand their surrender instead."
amcivwar.5000.a: "Send the offer"
amcivwar.5000.b: "Long's Minutemen must stand down"
amcivwar.5000.c: "They both must stand down"
amcivwar.5000.e: "Haywood must stand down"

amcivwar.5001.t: "PSA Demands we stand down!"
amcivwar.5001.d.AUSPSA: "The Pacific States have demanded we stand down, claiming that we are partially responsible for the Civil War and that our government was provisional. They claim they would support amnesty if we surrender but this would obviously mean the political end of Long and his allies and we very obviously can not accept. Feeling betrayed, the most militant of the AFP call on us to attack."
amcivwar.5001.d.AUSPSACSA: "The Pacific States have demanded we stand down, claiming that we are partially responsible for the Civil War and that our government was provisional. They claim they would support amnesty if we surrender but this would obviously mean the end of true socialism in the United States. With hardliners being vindicated they are already calling for war on both the capitalist AUS and PSA, desiring to just be done with the whole mess and the military and Congress is no longer resisting such calls."

amcivwar.5002.t: "PSA Offer!"
amcivwar.5002.d.AUSPSA: "The Pacific States have decided that since we were allies over the course of the war that the AUS is, more-or-less, a friend of democracy and putting their personal reservations about the populists aside have offered to hold a national referendum for control of the nation, with the current leadership of either the PSA or AUS would become the dominant partner in a national government. Likewise, with only a few Supreme Court justices still remaining both alive and credible, this would effectively hand the Supreme Court to the victor, and allow for appointees to occupied areas to be decided via an informal proportional representation depending on the results of the referendum.

amcivwar.5007.t: "Last Men Standing!"
amcivwar.5007.d: "It would appear as though we and the socialists are the last active participants of the American Civil War, a slightly awkward outcome as we are tethered by an agreement to peace but have no means of uniting America. Maury Maverick, the man who snagged the peace agreement the first time, has yet another proposition, to vote to reunite the nation with an 'expanded' Constitution to allow far more leeway for government intervention in the economy and ease of amending said Constitution, followed by an election between the current factions to decide the leaders of the nation. To ensure both sides play 'fairly' we will create Committees for Democracy to restrict corruption... outside of each others strongholds anyways. Out right-wing denouncnes the plan and notes that if we lose we would be handing the nation to syndicalist-collaborators, with the original opponents of the peace treaty calling on us to finish the job now that the SPA serves no useful purpose."

The Syndicalists and other radicals in Congress do not seem enthusiastic although the Social Patriots and Browderists are favorable towards the idea. Of course, with our control of industry we could just finish the AFP anyways, which many SPA leaders view as a bastion of petit-bourgeoisie demagoguery and corruption."

Each are eager to provide relief and propaganda to occupied citizens eligible to vote and are busy weeding out those with past ties to hostile regimes that are the least likely to support them. Nonetheless, the Commission for Democracy ensures no one can step over the line in their shenanigans, at least to the point of severely antagonizing each other. In the meantime internal factions that the other side could not accept have been taken off the ballot while still being tolerated as influential internal forces which is namely Earl Browder's newly reorganized Communist Party of the United States of America for the CSA and the Silver Legion of America for the AUS."

amcivwar.6.d: "President Huey Long has escaped to New Orleans and has declared that General MacArthur is a traitor to the people of America. He has gained ready listeners among a number of southern and Mid-Western governors, all of whom view this as the ultimate proof the establishement would never allow them to pass their reforms and that they no longer recognize MacArthur's authority, demanding his resignation. Long has spoken on the radio, urging all Americans to support the legitimate President and fight against the tyranny MacArthur represents."

Murray has given a speech that he will not stand for leftist tyranny, racial degeneration, and federal corruption that lead to the election of a 'backstabbing race traitor like Huey Long', empowerment of the anti-ODP MacArthur and now the formation of the CSA. On behalf of the Old Democrats and all "fellow true-blooded Americans" he declared a formal revolt for liberty, morality and white protestantism that would finish the fight started by Wilson and finally put an end to the 'Red Threat' in America. Throughout the American Southeast the Old Democrat and White League aligned governors and militias are signing a Manifesto in favor of a fully "Constitutional American Republic" that does not trample the heritage of the American people and fights against socialist immorality. White Leagues are currently attempting to maintain control of the border states that make up this new state before the Federal government, Minutemen and socialists attack."

amcivwar.7.d: "Shortly after having the SPA coordinate with militia leaders, Bill Haywood gave a rousing a radio broadcast from Chicago, urging all his followers to rise up against MacArthur, William H. Murray and all other reactionaries in the nation. Within the hour, a number of governors across the Steel Belt have announced their support and declared both President Long and General MacArthur as having no true authority. The governors have been bolstered by Haywood's supporters, who within days have overtaken army posts and erected road blocks throughout the northern states."

amcivwar.8.d: "The governors of the Pacific states have declared that MacArthur, William H. Murray, Huey Long and Bill Haywood are all traitors, tyrants, and enemies of America. They currently have not seceded from the Union, but instead refuse to recognize the authority of any of the competing governments. Governor Frank Merriam announced at the Sacramento legislature that, if push came to shove, they would see 'proper democracy' restored to the country by force."

amcivwar.8000.t: "Reach out to the Victor?"
amcivwar.8000.d: "While only winning the presidency due to the House of Representatives, Huey Long is nonetheless a technically democratically-elected president. Given his populist rhetoric against the "Corporate" system however it seems he is now willing to pursue an anti-constitutional means of implementing his program before he's even been inaugurated so going to war with him would not be unjustifiable to our population. Nonetheless is would bolster our moral position if he was offered a passive alliance in return for recognizing the United States Constitution, including allowing the Supreme Court to review his laws. Given his pro-American rhetoric and desire to appeal to more mainstream progressives he will likely accept, especially as he is short on manpower."
amcivwar.8000.a: "We should at least try"
amcivwar.8000.b: "We don't negotiate with tyrants"

amcivwar.8001.t: "PSA offers peace?"
amcivwar.8001.d: "The Pacific States of America has decided to recognize that we are the victors of the 1936 election and that, therefor, they are willing to ally us. Many in the AFP are annoyed by their questionable loyalty however and apparent hypocrisy in their reluctance to join the Longist cause while claming to support American Democracy, with Long desiring they show respect to the AFP by giving tax favors to Share the Wealth and allowing the AFP to recruit as freely as they wish. Others are pressing Long that this is not enough and they should simpy join the cause outright, although there is no way they would accept it would make for simple propaganda against them."

amcivwar.8001.b: "No, they should join us outright!"

amcivwar.9.t: "Standoff in America"
amcivwar.9.d: "A tense standoff has erupted in the United States, as democratically-elected President Huey Long fled to the city of New Orleans after being forcibly removed from his position by General Douglas MacArthur. From New Orleans, Long's supporters have declared MacArthur's government illegitimate - as have the northern supporters of syndicalist Bill Haywood, based in Chicago, and the Pacific Governors and their Congress. All have been given a deadline by General MacArthur of thirty days to either stand down or face arrest and execution. Considering all sides are rapidly raising forces, the idea that America seems headed into a second civil war seems almost certain."
amcivwar.9.a: "I see"

amcivwar.10.t: "The Second Civil War"
amcivwar.10.d: "The federal government's deadline has come and gone, and with large militia forces having been raised on every side it is clear what their answer truly is. The Second American Civil War has begun."

### Set Up Events - Murray ###
amcivwar.1011.t: "President Murray Declares the Constitutional American Republic"
amcivwar.1011.d: "President Murray has arrived in Atlanta after being warned of MacArthur's coup merely minutes before it happened. In his speech he blamed financial, Jewish and leftist machinations against him and that MacArthur was a tool of those who wanted to see the United States 'mongolized', of which the syndicalists and Share the Wealth are also simply useful tools of. He went on to say it was the duty of every American who wanted a future for children to stand against the Federal Government and their banking elite, ending the speech by saying "semper sic tyrannis". Due to his status as the former United States President he has gained followers where he otherwise may not have."

amcivwar.1012.d: "Bill Haywood has given a rousing a radio broadcast from Chicago, urging all his followers to rise up against the forces of reaction embodied by the ODP and the 'Bonapartist' MacArthur. Within the hour, virtually every militia leader and a number of governors across the Steel Belt have announced their support and declared President Murray, General MacArthur and anyone else who stands with capitalism as having no true authority. The governors have been bolstered by Haywood's supporters, who within days have overtaken army posts and erected road blocks throughout the northern states."

amcivwar.1013.d.Mac: "After meeting with allies such as Oscar K. Allen, Robert La Follete and the leading Minuteman sympathizer within the military Terry de la Mesa Allen, Huey Long has declared a new provisional government 'to protect the common man', claiming his American Union State is the best defense this countries got against those who would abuse Her. Decrying MacArthur for 'abusing' his position and not siding with Long against the syndicalists and White Leaguers simply to appease the establishment, he has promised to restore American democracy and demanded the House appoint a new President who would be a compromiser, even suggesting himself. As this is obviously impossible, it seems Long's coalition has already raised the Minutemen and their other militias in preparation for the likely coming conflict."

Allen, Robert La Follete and the leading Minuteman sympathizer within the military Terry de la Mesa Allen, Huey Long has declared a new provisional government 'to protect the common man', claiming his American Union State is the best defense this countries got against those who would abuse Her. Decrying Murray for 'abusing' his position and claiming he has little interest in anything beyond empowering the White League 'terror machines', he has promised to restore American democracy and demanded the House appoint a new President who would be a compromiser, even suggesting himself.

Given his reactionary rhetoric against the "Carpetbagger" system however it seems he is now willing to pursue an anti-constitutional means of implementing his program so going to war with him would not be unjustifiable to our population. Nonetheless is would bolster our moral position if he was offered a passive alliance in return for recognizing the United States Constitution, including allowing the Supreme Court to review his laws even if it's unlikely he will allow West Coast liberals to compromise his counter-revolution."
amcivwar.1015.a: "We should at least try"
amcivwar.1015.b: "We don't negotiate with tyrants"

amcivwar.1016.t: "PSA offers peace?"
amcivwar.1016.d: "The Pacific States of America has decided to recognize that we are the victors of the 1936 election and that, therefor, they are willing to ally us. However we would be constrained by many of their laws including the constitution that most Old Democrats feel has been perverted for nearly 100 years to serve the interests of cosmopolitan bankers, Jews and leftists. As such virtually all of our cabinet advise against the bill claiming that it would leave Murray without any legitimacy unless we told them it was conditional on them joining the CAR, which is essentially another way to reject the deal while making appear the unreasonable aggressor."
amcivwar.1016.a: "Flat out decline"
amcivwar.1016.b: "Make the demands"
amcivwar.1016.c: "I don't care what the cabinet says, I accept"

amcivwar.1017.t: "Offer declined"

amcivwar.1017.a: "A crying shame"

amcivwar.1018.t: "Old Democrats Revolt!"
amcivwar.1018.d: "The Old Democrats are furious we have accepted to be constrained by the very forces we are battling. They say we are to immediately revoke the deal and order the PSA to be absorbed by CAR, which is the only legitimate government. If not, the representatives of the party will vote for a new head of state, whom will represent the beliefs of all true patriots. While technically Murray has sole executive power, his regime has not yet stabilized as too many factions are at play within the recently formed CAR. It is clear that he does not yet have the means to oppose a revolt from a majority of the upper members of the party, and for those ultra-hardliners whom already dislike Murray for marrying a native woman, it is the perfect excuse to remove him. However, while Murray has been made bitter by these betrayals, he has found a kindred spirit in Georgia Senator Richard Russell Jr. Although Russell is a Democrat, he has managed to maneuver his way into a strong political position as the most powerful man in his state, and he promises to continue Murray's vision should Murray choose to give him his approval to be the next leader of the Constitutional American Republic. "
amcivwar.1018.a: "Then this is a fools war, I stand down"
amcivwar.1018.b: "Fine, the deal is rejected"
amcivwar.1018.c: "I give my blessing to Richard Russell Jr"

amcivwar.1019.t: "New Party Head"
amcivwar.1019.d: "It was clear that we could not allow Murray to accept such a deal as nearly all our major backers, especially the White Leaguers, would no longer support us if allowed the Pacific States bureaucrats to run the show. Nonetheless, while we will have Murray step down quietly under the claim that it's for health related reasons we nonetheless need a new head of the party. Two main factions have come forward. The first is the National Democrats, an internal faction of the Old Democrats led by Charles Lindbergh and Henry Ford that represent the urban centered Old Democrats and claim they can offer heavy industrial support to the war efforts while carrying on the Old Democrat legacy. The second group is the National Democratic White League that makes up the various paramilitaries, societies and other radical organizations supporting the Old Democrats and made up largely of the Klan and its various auxilaries and offshoots. They claim that they can provide the neccessary strength and support needed to win the war, and no-one doubts their desire to bring America under white protestant rule at all costs. Their control of the closest entities we have to intelligence services and manpower makes them a force to be reckoned with, and Klan leader (and de facto most powerful NDWL member) William Joseph Simmons a popular choice for leader with white league representatives pushing for it as we speak. Of course, a third idea has come up within the party to simply support General Patton as the new head of state to carry on the Old Democrat legacy. The choice ultimately comes down to vice-president John E. Rankin to whom the party has made it clear the House would not allow him to take the presidency his position in the ODP gives him the power to be kingmaker while the factions are split."
amcivwar.1019.a: "Lindbergh is a popular youngster"
amcivwar.1019.b: "We must support Simmons"
amcivwar.1019.c: "Round up support for Patton"

amcivwar.1020.t: "Standoff in America"
amcivwar.1020.d: "A tense standoff has erupted in the United States, as democratically-elected President William H. Murray fled to Atlanta after being forcibly removed from his position by General Douglas MacArthur. From there, Murray's supporters have declared MacArthur's government illegitimate - as have the northern supporters of syndicalist Bill Haywood, based in Chicago, Huey Long and his rural populist allies in the Midwwest and South, and the Pacific Governors under the leadership of Governor Frank Merriam. All have been given a deadline by General MacArthur of thirty days to either stand down or face arrest and execution. Considering all sides are rapidly raising forces, the idea that America seems headed into a second civil war seems almost certain."
amcivwar.1020.a: "I see"

amcivwar.1021.t: "Russell's Demands"
amcivwar.1021.d: "Richard Russell has received our offer and has agreed to be constrained by the Constitution. However, he has demanded that a national election be held as soon as the region is reunited, desires a softer approach towards the Klan within our territory, and has called on the PSA leadership to announce that Russell is doing all he can to save American Democracy and to allow recruitment within their territory. It seems even in a time of war, Russell still has political maneuvering on his mind."
amcivwar.1021.a: "Still accept"
amcivwar.1021.b: "Screw this, withdraw our offer"

amcivwar.1022.t: "The West Accepts"
amcivwar.1022.d: "We have secured an alliance with the PSA despite naysayers within both Republics denouncing the move. We can now work with them towards destroying the so-called 'Western Command Center' of Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower as well as Huey Long's American Union State, relieving us of forces that can now be used further East."
amcivwar.1022.a: "I've outdone myself!"

amcivwar.1023.t: "The Pacific States denounces us!"
amcivwar.1023.d: "The Western oligarchs and bureaucrats have, perhaps expectedly, denounced our attempts to help the people despite the relatively low-cost of our requests in return for peace. Calling Russell an "opportunist", they seem deadset on forcing all other Americans to bend the knee and arrogantly refuse to recognize our government as legitimate, demanding we hand over our forces at once."
amcivwar.1023.a: "Finance resistance to the end"

amcivwar.1024.t: "Russell Accepts"
amcivwar.1024.d: "Russell has accepted the offer and we are now assembling a committee to oversee and distribute the national referendum. Most of our citizens are enthusiastic the war can finally come to a peaceful end even if a few hardliners are upset."

amcivwar.1026.a: "The Pacific States of America"
amcivwar.1026.b: "The Constitutional American Republic"

amcivwar.1027.t: "Last Men Standing!"
amcivwar.1027.d.CORPSA: "The CAR and PSA are the last major governments standing from the ACW participants as each side has stuck to their respective treaties. The question now remains what to do to unite America as both sides view themselves as the legitimate American Government. Our diplomats have offered to send the CAR a treaty that would allow for a national referendum to settle the debate so long as both sides allow the constitution to restrain them upon victory. The referendum offer would require voting oversight boards to help prevent tampering and that the losing side would be given more autonomy compared to the pre-war period to run their region more in-line with their own beliefs. As most of Congress is a shell in the recently conquered areas, the referendum would use proportional representation to decide the number of appointees in these regions, allowing the victor a chance to enact their agenda. On the other hand, those such as a General DeWitt and Democratic Party leader Charles Martin believe Russell is little more than a demagogue and to give him an opportunity to become President after the Civil War Disaster, which they partially lay at his and Bill Murray's feet, would be immoral. Instead, they would have us demand he stand down."
amcivwar.1027.a: "Send the offer"

They say President [USA.GETLeader] and his government have no authority, demanding they surrender to a committee headed by Haywood to oversee the restructuring of a pro-worker government."

amcivwar.13.t: "The President Returns"
amcivwar.13.d: "The President of the United States has arrived to the PSA after essentially walking out on MacArthur. He is dismayed that it has come to this but is well-aware that a war needs to be won but that, hopefully, it can be ended sooner rather than later. He gave a speech denouncing MacArthur for his "anti-American" behavior and calling on the Western Command Center to stand down in favor of American values. Perhaps we should call on him to step down given the outbreak of the war and his continued hopes in compromise with the enemy."
amcivwar.13.a: "It's time for him to step down"
amcivwar.13.b: "He is our president thick or thin"

amcivwar.1300.t: "Standoff in America"
amcivwar.1300.d: "The Republicans have lost control of the situation in America, with the White House being couped by the military and a large number of governors declared his government illegitimate, throwing their support behind either southern populist Huey Long or the syndicalist leader Bill Haywood. They stopped short of seceding from the Union, but declared that the federal government holds no authority within their state borders until MacArthur steps down and a 'reconciliation council' under their chosen leader is put into place to restore order in the nation. In response, General MacArthur has given the governors thirty days to stand down - making it all but certain that the United States will descend into civil war for the second time in less than a century."
amcivwar.1300.a: "I see"

amcivwar.1313.t: "Baseball Season Canceled"
amcivwar.1313.d: "A sad day has fallen for Americans as Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis has announced an end to all league baseball effective immediately. This move comes as no suprise as the governors' standoff had made traveling between cities nearly impossible, and as such teams just been playing within the states under control of friendly governors. As the standoff seems to have no peaceful soluton, even this stopgap effort has halted and the [GetYear] World Series has been effectively canceled as well. The one last thing that brought all Americans together is no more."
amcivwar.1313.a: "The national pastime can't exist without a nation."

### Set Up Events - Garner ###
amcivwar.14.t: "Huey Long Condemns the Federal Government"
amcivwar.14.d: "Huey Long has declared that President Garner is a tyrant and must be opposed. In a radio speech, he denounced the president for being in league with corporations and accused him of doing nothing to stop the chaos but attack the populace. Long has vowed to restore order and destroy the corrupt government in Washington, and a number of southern and Midwestern politicians and militias immediately declared their support for him and demanded that Garner immediately step down and turn over control to Long and a 'reconciliation committee' that would see a restructuring of the American government. It appears we will have pull some of forces East."

amcivwar.15.t: "Haywood Calls for Action"
amcivwar.15.d: "The crackdown on the Socialist Party could have only had one outcome: Bill Haywood has called upon the workers of America to stand up against their capitalist overlords, saying that decent Americans have a moral obligation to take action against President Garner, General MacArthur and the corrupt, anti-democratic, anti-worker agenda he represents. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Haywood, backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."

amcivwar.1500.d: "The attacks on the ODP would no longer go unchallenged as White League leaders in Georgia under Sam Green have run out federal forces. As feds retreat from the region William H. Murray went on the radio to declare that President Garner is a tyrant and race traitor trying to hand over the South to social radicals. A number of southern governors and virtually all the White Leaguers have put their support behind him, announcing that they do not see the current federal government as legitimate and thus refuse to recognize its authority, ordering them to stand down."

They stopped short of seceding from the Union, but declared that the federal government holds no authority within their state borders until MacArthur steps down and a 'reconciliation council' under their chosen leader is put into place to restore order in the nation.

### Set Up Events - Norris ###
amcivwar.17.t: "Huey Long Condemns the Government"
amcivwar.17.d: "The formation of the CSA, CAR and MacArthur's coup reportedly scared Huey Long as all are known to be antagonistic towards him and his Share the Wealth Societies, especially in comparison to George Norris. He has announced that he has been given 'no choice' but to form a provisional government that will defend the common man from all three unless MacArthur stands down, reappoints President Norris and Long himself is appointed on the cabinet to 'ensure a democratic cabinet'. While no one actually expects this to happen his Midwest populist-progressive coalition have joined him with Long offering to offer safery to Norris though, oddly enough, they do not believe he should be head of the so-called 'American Union State'. Announcing that do not expect the elite to change their practices (both political economic) unless threatened with direct force, they have raised a large amount of militia forces and governors lending their state-level national guard to the cause."

amcivwar.18.t: "Murray Revolts Against Washington!"
amcivwar.18.d: "We are no longer able to hold a lid on the NDWL and ODP strongholds with organized ODP forces quickly overwhelming remaining federal agents with the support of state controlled national guardsmen. Our recent "offenses" towards them has lead to William H. Murray declaring via radio that President Norris is a sellout to international bankers, anti-Protestants and reds who would never side with America over those would racially pollute it and that he, Long and Haywood must be fought to preserve the American way of life. A number of governors around the Southeast and virtually all the White League associated militias and politicians have put their support behind him, announcing that they do not see the Norris government as legitimate and thus refuse to recognize its authority."

amcivwar.1800.t: "Bill Haywood Calls for Action"
amcivwar.1800.d: "The Norris Government has failed to reach out to the Steel Belt and its SPA political controllers since taking office as they promised to and and with their failure, America has been broken. Bill Haywood today announced that the workers of America must take a stand against the governments, and almost immediately a number of northern governors declared their support for him. They say President Norris and his government have lost all legitimacy and are calling on workers to take the means of production, with Haywood offering political amnesty for those who recognize the new socialist government. With the backing of the Steel Belt"

amcivwar.1800.b: "The rising has begun. Stand by the Workers (Lead the CSA)"

amcivwar.19.t: "Standoff in America"
amcivwar.19.d: "President Norris experienced a major blow today as a large number of governors declared his government illegitimate, throwing their support behind either southern populist Huey Long or the syndicalist leader Bill Haywood, and his executive branch is now in practice run by general Douglas MacArthur. They stopped short of seceding from the Union, but declared that the federal government holds no authority within their state borders until Norris steps down and a 'reconciliation council' under their chosen leader is put into place to restore order in the nation. Norris has decided to remove himself from the situation by returning to Nebraska, both to protest MacArthur's takeover and in the belief he would make the situation worse if he remained president. MacArthur has given the governors thirty days to stand down - making it all but certain that the United States will descend into civil war for the second time in less than a century."
amcivwar.19.a: "I see"

### CSA Flavor Events ###
amcivwar.29.t: "Building a Red Navy"
amcivwar.29.d: "The Admirals of the United States have prevented any of their ships from being liberated by the workers and thus we are deprived of a navy. To solve that, those admirals that joined the revolution and the countless dock workers are planning on building up a new navy. We do have quite a number of ships in New York that we can convert to warships. We can either go with destroyers or cruisers. What shall we go for?"
amcivwar.29.a: "Destroyers"
amcivwar.29.b: "Cruisers"

amcivwar.30.t: "Directive 10: Redistribution of Material Assets"
amcivwar.30.d: "Now that the revolution has begun, we must decide what should be done to the bourgeoisie. The IWW proclaim we confiscate all their wealth and redistribute it to the people immediately. The up-and-coming Vanguard has called for their immediate arrest and execution as well, citing the fate of Vladimir Lenin as an example of a revolution defeated by leniency. SPA members belonging to the depreciated AFL, along with several loyal Progressives have sought life over death. Asking the Central Committee to only expropriate what is necessary for war, and keep their materialist constituents happy. "
amcivwar.30.a: "Their wealth and their lives are ours!"
amcivwar.30.b: "We may need these moderates in the future"

amcivwar.31.t: "Bourgeoise Flee to Canada"
amcivwar.31.d: "Some members of the bourgeoise, particularly in Chicago and Detriot, have decided that they will flee the CSA. Thousands have sought refuge within enemy territory, Especially within the illegitmate Canadian government. The thieving scum have taken whatever of their stolen wealth they could carry with them as they have escaped the revolution."
amcivwar.31.a: "The revolution will come for them, in time"

amcivwar.32.t: "Military Debate!"
amcivwar.32.d: "The Revolutionary Congress has yet to decide on a coherent military policy as each political faction puts forward their own plan. The IWW has backed a plan that relies on industry to outproduce the other factions in the arena of mechanization, believing we will eventually have too many industrial advantages for them to hope to beat us like the Union in the First American Civil War, and as such they call it the Union Plan. The Social Patriots however support Smedley Butler's efforts to create an organized 'Republican Army' that relies on more traditional leadership and command of our superior numbers and industry to defeat the enemy. The Collectivst-Syndicalists and most radical anarchists oppose both plans for not relying on the revolutionary will of the proletariat, noting that the workers will simply overwhelm the reactionaries and this is more consistant with Marxist princliples, and have put forward a mass mobilization plan that will be lead by Foster-supporter Jack Shulman. Finally a Centralist faction have backed a plan that relies on industry similar to the IWW but instead desire a focus on sheer firepower to blow the enemy away from a distance, with James Burnham and Earl Browder both backing the plan."
amcivwar.32.a: "The IWW Plan"
amcivwar.32.b: "The Social Patriot Plan"
amcivwar.32.c: "The Collectivist Plan"
amcivwar.32.e: "The Centralist Plan"

amcivwar.33.t: "Directive 213: War Syndicalism"
amcivwar.33.d: "As the war stalemates and perhaps may even turn against us, the Central Committee is debating a comprehensive economic reform proposal known as 'War Syndicalism.' Some of its proposals, such as state control of all foreign trade, nationalization of all factories, strict labour discipline are not especially controversial. It also includes potentially problematic measures such as the outlawing of wildcat strikes, obligatory labour-duty for those not working or in the military, strict food rationing, and military control over railroads. This is seen as tyrannical within the SPA with a number saying that some of the latter measures, especially the outlawing of wildcat strikes would betray the values of the revolution, and make the current government no better than its Capitalist enemies. Those supporting the proposal in the Vanguard counter that it is necessary in order to achieve victory in the revolution, and that the first laws passed after the end of the war will revert War Syndicalism."
amcivwar.33.a: "Enact War Syndicalism"
amcivwar.33.b: "That's not Socialism!"

amcivwar.34.t: "The Red Witches"
amcivwar.34.d: "Gender equality has long been a major ideological component of socialist thought, and we have yet more evidence that it works! A squadron of female pilots has earned renown throughout the CSA for their daring raids on enemy territory, their coordinated and synchronised attack formations allowing them to take down larger enemy air forces with ease. Derisively named the 'Red Witches' by the reactionary forces under Huey Long, the squadron, led by Florence 'Pancho' Barnes, has taken their new nickname up with a great deal of pride."
amcivwar.34.a: "Death is in the air"

amcivwar.35.t: "Female Soldiers"
amcivwar.35.d: "As the Revolutionary struggle continues a number of women have joined the armed struggle in accordance with the socialist ideals of gender equality. While not all are accepted by their male comrades, it has not deterred many from fighting and dying for the revolution. Manuals have been distributed to recruiters on how to effectively organize Women Detachments, of which the militas can teach the military a thing or two. Of course, this has caused extremely mixed reactions within the socialist congress. Anarchists are largely supportive but more traditional forces such as the AFL and some of the SPA, such as Earl Browder are squeemish, arguing the workers revolution should protect its female population from danger while the Guild Socialists seem to waffle between the two. The American Workers Party of course is strongly opposed to the presence of female soliders believing revolutionary women are more helpful to the revolution on the homefront. /n/Surprisingly even the Fosterites are nearly split on the issue despite being radical social progressives but criticizing it from a revolutionary perspective, arguing that the lowered birth race rates resulting from female soldiers deaths will give reactionary, capitalist nations a population advantage and therefor contradicts Fosterite Collectivist-Syndicalist thought while others view it as a necessity for full social revolution. What should we do!"
amcivwar.35.a: "Rebel Girl, you are the queen of my world!"
amcivwar.35.b: "Lower the number of female infantry soldiers"

amcivwar.36.t: "Internal Conflicts"
amcivwar.36.d: "At the offset of the revolution, Bill Haywood placed the IWW as the model and future successor to Congress. This has granted us the rabid support of the Left Radical side of Congress such as the IWW, Anarchists and Fosterites but at the cost of alienating those whom are not fully on board with syndicalism despite being sympathetic to pro-labor, socialist ideals. They instead look to the right-wing of our Congress, the AFL and Bellaymist Independent League, for a new path for America to follow that is not as 'extreme' as syndicalism. Sitting between the two is the Browderists, American Workers Party and CIO whom appear to favor a more centralzied syndicalist model albeit in quite different ways. The Social Patriots are already calling for a one-time 'universal' citizen vote to decide remaining congressional seats rather than a purely worker-union one, believing the American people more generally should be given an opportunity to express a different conception of socialism if they desire it. Syndicalists and even moreso Collectivists are disgusted by this suggestion, believing it would just be a chance for social reactionaries to hijack the revolution and would give a chance for the bourgeoisie (petit and otherwise) to override the will of the worker. As their arguing gets louder with everyday they are forcing us to make a decision, although favoring one would likely weaken the other and shoving through a pro-syndicalist stance might turn off potential supporters."
amcivwar.36.a: "This is a syndicalist nation now"
amcivwar.36.b: "A single 'traditional' vote is fair"

amcivwar.36001.t: "Social Patriots Demand Election!"
amcivwar.36001.d: "The Social Patriots within the military have demanded a traditional vote to decide remaining seats, something that can only help their faction! They claim that it is undemocratic to exclude voters from the process and claim we are 'rigging' the process against the Social Patriots. While some of the IWW is offended by the militaries demand, viewing it as entitled and undemocratic, others claim we should listen."
amcivwar.36001.a: "No"
amcivwar.36001.b: "Very Well"

amcivwar.36002.t: "Military Takeover!"
amcivwar.36002.d: "Smedley Butler and his military clique have denounced the decision of the Revolutionary Congress and sidelined them, entering Congress with a large force and declaring that the remaining seats will indeed be decided by a traditional vote. With Butler in command, the Social Patriots have further strengthened their position by adopting 'Unity Legislation' that attempts to give amnesty to more citizens suspected of treachery. However, they have no intention of actively forcing out the IWW and left-radicals, allowing them to stay in Congress."
amcivwar.36002.a: "Whoops"

amcivwar.36003.t: "Syndicalist Dominance"
amcivwar.36003.d: "The Social Patriots within Congress have utterly failed to throw around their influence in such a way as to cut left radical influence while gaining their own. With the majority of Congress controlled by syndicalist unions who have the lion's share of control, it is clear that the Social Patriots will have to take a backseat to the revolution, hoping to gain whatever favors and union influence they can to prop up local power bases and get rewards for members."
amcivwar.36003.a: "The Revolution is Secure!"

amcivwar.3600.t: "Social Patriots Unity Legislation!"
amcivwar.3600.d: "The Social Patriots within Congress have put forward a controversial bill that would allow former agents of capitalism to be granted amnesty if they back our war effort. Furthermore, those considered politically 'suspect' will be offered amnesty as well if they join our army and/or unions. Naturally the Radicals are strongly opposed to this, believing they are too dangerous to given so much power and influence and instead desire we simply use them for either menial labor or house arrest until the war is over, depending on who they are."
amcivwar.3600.a: "Adopt the Unity Legislation"
amcivwar.3600.b: "Shoot it down"

amcivwar.3601.t: "TUUL Ultimatum"
amcivwar.3601.d: "The Trade Union Unity League is none too happy about us increasingly adopting Social Patriotic legislation. Feeling that they are being edged by the Social Patriots a grouping of Fosterites and radical syndicalists have begun announcing from soapboxes that it is time for [CSA.GetLeader] and the Congress to neutralize their influence 'before the CSA is overtaken by reaction'. Foster has told us that his organization is prepared to take action if we do not appoint his men to cabinet positions and expand TUUL and (to appease his new allies) IWW seats on the Congress so that the Social Patriots lose all hope of seizing power."
amcivwar.3601.a: "We must appease Foster"
amcivwar.3601.b: "Act against Fosterite threat"
amcivwar.3601.c: "Send in Capone"

amcivwar.3602.t: "TUUL Weakened"
amcivwar.3602.d: "As several TUUL rallies have been disrupted by the military and some of their soldiers and loyalists have met sudden and violent deaths in the past week Foster has little choice but to take Butler's direct warning to him today to heart, agreeing to stand down and allow for politics to be settled after the war is over so long as we cease anti-TUUL activity."
amcivwar.3602.a: "Good"

amcivwar.3603.t: "Social Patriots in power"
amcivwar.3603.d: "As they have an increasing majority in Congress and enough popular support that even the IWW is losing ground to them, the Social Patriots are increasingly running congress to the consternation of the Left Radicals, especially as their legislation often favors their faction."
amcivwar.3603.a: "It's how it had to happen"

amcivwar.3604.t: "Left Radical Revolt!"
amcivwar.3604.d: "A small segment of the Left Radicals have decided to endanger the entire CSA over the issue of the Social Patriots gaining power. Calling themselves the Vanguard of the Revolution, they are a grouping of Collectivist-Syndicalists, Galleanists and some militant anarcho-communists whom have taken up small strongholds in the cities and have set up blockades. With Foster now having much of his TUUL defect to them they are warning us to surrender before they retake the nation. However, while their actions have been a thorn in our side, it has not endangered much love amongst the populace and them endangering the existence of the CSA has angered even many syndicalists, with even part of the TUUL itself breaking off from Foster. We can end the threat, but it will be bloody."
amcivwar.3604.a: "Take them out"

amcivwar.3605.t: "Radicals Crushed!"
amcivwar.3605.d: "The Ultra-Radicals have been crushed and with it our position cemented. With even many TUUC leaders appearing to have fled for the Commune of France we are at last victorious. With the Social Patriots passing legislation to mimic more traditional democracies by making it easier for non-union voters to influence elections the future of the nation appears to be in their hands. Though the IWW still remains as a force with local syndicates as continuing the war without them would be impossible."
amcivwar.3605.a: "Very Well"

amcivwar.3606.t: "Military Demands Amnesty!"
amcivwar.3606.d: "The rebellion has been crushed but as much of our Collectivist-influenced military is sympathetic to the revolutionaries they demand amnesty for the surviving ones, especially Foster's right-hand man Eugene Dennis, saying they were simply pushed too far and disrespected by our current political leadership."
amcivwar.3606.a: "Fine, give amnesty"
amcivwar.3606.b: "I don't think so"

amcivwar.3607.t: "Fosterite Coup!"
amcivwar.3607.d: "The military has joined forces with the former rebels, with Jack Shullman releasing the supposedly imprisoned TUUC militants, including Eugene Dennis. With the Fosterite military having turned on us it is clear that Foster is in command, causing many of the Social Patriots to either agree to step down or flee the nation."
amcivwar.3607.a: "We're finished"

amcivwar.3608.t: "Military Demands IWW Support!"
amcivwar.3608.d: "The IWW-leaning military has been disturbed by the Social Patriots dominating Congress and have called on a compromise in which we grant greater local power to syndicates and communes so they are not overly influenced by our agenda. Of course this decentralization will weaken us."
amcivwar.3608.a: "Agree"
amcivwar.3608.b: "Unacceptable"

amcivwar.3609.t: "Syndicalist Coup"
amcivwar.3609.d: "The IWW military under the direction of Big Bill Haywood has couped Congress and reinstated Haywood with his original executive authority, railing against the Social Patriots for forcing his hand with their undemocratic actions. The Social Patriots have decried this although an attempt by AFL militias to push back failed. We now have a choice of allowing them to stay in Congress so long as they accept our leadership or a purge of the Social Patriots who pushed against our demands. Foster has called for a purge against his rivals but Dorothy Day would prefer amnesty, saying that our democracy is new and misteps and confusion under such circumstances was likely inevitable, and to enact a purge would be to re-enact the capitalist democracies repression."
amcivwar.3609.a: "Purge them"
amcivwar.3609.b: "Amnesty for loyalism"

amcivwar.3610.t: "Social Patriots Cement Power"
amcivwar.3610.d: "A Social Patriot faction within Congress has emerged dominant, to the point of the anarchists relying more on their communes and the IWW only serving as a tie breaker in some votes. This is the result of Browder's SPA faction and James Burnham crossing the aisle and aligning themselves with the Social Patriots, passing legislation that undermines left-radicals by making the Red Guard further subserviant to Congress, weakening Haywood's executive powers and further cutting union representatives in favor of geographical representatives which only damages the IWW's hold by allowing non-union members and even the middle-class to more directly influence the elections. Now it appears the Social Patriots run the show and will need to settle their differences when the war is over."
amcivwar.3610.a: "Sometimes the underdog can win"

amcivwar.3611.t: "Capone Storms Congress"
amcivwar.3611.d: "The Decision of President Haywood to send the Mob to deal with the IWW turned out to be a grave mistake. Instead of destroying the protesting unions, Capone managed to rally them to his side, and throughout the week as the situation deteriorated, used his influence to secure every facet of our government for his own means. Today, Capone’s power peaked as his mafioso and IWW allies stormed congress, and Alphonse Capone sent a formal request to William Haywood to resign and appoint Capone as President, or face dire consequences. "
amcivwar.3611.a: "Oops"

amcivwar.37.t: "Directive 656: Winter Resource Allocation Program([GetYear])"
amcivwar.37.d: "The revolution must succeed, but the revolution is also for the people. When supporting the revolution and supporting the people are the same, the choice is trivial, but when one must be prioritized over the other, hard choices must be made. The Central Committee has been made aware that the supply situation is critical, and either the people or the army must be undersupplied through the winter."
amcivwar.37.a: "We fight for the people"
amcivwar.37.b: "We fight for the revolution"

amcivwar.38.t: "Directive 764: Revolutionary Education Act"
amcivwar.38.d: "To those who are well educated, either formally or through bitter experience, revolutionary thought comes as easily as breathing. However, many of our comrades, whether in the Steel Belt or elsewhere in America, have been lied to their entire lives by the capitalists, and do not understand how the revolution frees them. Many do not give their heart and soul to the revolution, and some even attempt to sabotage our efforts, unaware that we are the only force that truly cares for them. This must be remedied, and our comrades must be deprogrammed. Should we focus on reaching those in our territory, keeping our own morale up, or should we spread our message throughout enemy territory, and sap their will to fight their liberators?"
amcivwar.38.a: "Focus on the socialist family"
amcivwar.38.b: "Focus on the reactionary enemy"

amcivwar.39.t: "Directive 984: Sentencing of Pre-War Capitalist Politicians"
amcivwar.39.d: "As the revolution nears success, the people demand that we deal with the corrupt, capitalist politicians in office before the revolution who now rot in our cells. Some believe that by having these politicians work hard labour for a few years, they will empathize with the worker, and be converted to our cause. Others believe that no amount of education can reform them, and they must remain behind bars for the rest of their lives. A small, but vocal minority insists that they must be executed for their crimes, like the Romanovs or the Bourbon dynasties of old."
amcivwar.39.a: "They shall be redeemed by the sweat on their brows and the ache of their backs"
amcivwar.39.b: "They shall watch as the world leaves them behind and makes them irrelevant"
amcivwar.39.c: "It is now our turn, and we shall not make excuses for the terror!"

amcivwar.40.t: "Directive 1231: Establish the CIA"
amcivwar.40.d: "It is an unfortunate fact that there are spies and saboteurs within our territory working to prevent our glorious liberation of the proletarian masses. Of the many proposals submitted to the Central Committee, one stands out. Earl Browder's proposal is to create a committee to enforce revolutionary order and stop counter-revolutionary sabotage. However, others within the Central Committee, including Chairman Haywood, wonder if this is a necessary step and if we would be betraying our ideals. Regardless, a vote was taken. What was decided?"
amcivwar.40.a: "The CIA will be created!"
amcivwar.40.b: "It is not necessary for now"

amcivwar.41.t: "Red Terror"
amcivwar.41.d: "War is hell. Civil war, even more so. The psychological strain caused by having to repeatedly kill, even if the enemy are capitalists, has caused some of our soldiers and commanders to become sadistic beyond what some consider to be acceptable. Although not commonplace, reports of systematic mass executions and torture are being reported from both the front lines and core territories to suppress populations suspected of aiding the capitalist factions. Haywood has made an executive decision to supress these reports from the free media. 'If the revolution were to fail because of a few bad apples', says Haywood 'then humanity would collectively suffer for centuries longer'."
amcivwar.41.a: "Tis' the final conflict, after all"

amcivwar.42.t: "Directive 1398: Minimum Conscription Age"
amcivwar.42.d: "The war is not going our way. The detestable capitalists have pushed back our forces on all fronts, and we are in danger of running out of troops to man the guns we have. Desperate times require desperate measures, and one proposal, by William Z. Foster that has caused controversy is the proposal to lower the conscription age to 11. While this would provide us with the manpower needed to fight the revolution, quite a number of members of the Central Committee have expressed horror at this drastic measure."
amcivwar.42.a: "Any man would give his son"
amcivwar.42.b: "Any man would protect his son"

amcivwar.44.t: "Directive 53: Leading the Revolutionary Army"

### AUS Flavor Events ###

amcivwar.48.t: "Pelley pledges allegiance to Long"
amcivwar.48.d: "One of the more unusual well-wishers to visit Huey Long is an eccentric but passionate man named William Dudley Pelley. Pelley is the leader of a nativist political and religious social club called the Silver Legion that espouses its own brand of economic, political and cultural populism. However, it is no secret that the club has more exclusionary themes than most of Long's AFP, with Pelley openly espousing anti-Semitic ideas and embracing a form of chauvinism that distrusts elements of society he views as not qualified for full benefits. Furthermore, while he has opposed the ODP for its 'backwards' ideas and opposition to what Pelley believes to be 'true' populism, Christian themes and national unity, many believe the so-called 'ward system' he embraces for poor southern blacks among other groups to be little more than a rehash of Jim Crow-esque policies but with a nicer face to it. His membership size is moderate but his enthusiasm for Huey Long's ideals has long been enthusiastic and the two have collaborated in the past, with AFP and Silver Legion militias joining forces against socialists and, less often for the Silver Legion, the NDWL. Pelley has come with a request for money to take on an evangelistic and patriotic tour of America to gather supporters for the American Union State. This proposal would imply to Huey's followers that he supports the movement which is likely to anger his parties left-wing given Pelley's fanatical anti-leftism alongside his other ideals, and risks alienating potential Longist supporters while empowering the potential competitor that is the Silver Legion. How shall we respond?"
amcivwar.48.a: "More loyalists are always good"
amcivwar.48.b: "He will have to make do with what he's got"

amcivwar.50.t: "Chief of Staff"
amcivwar.50.d: "With the civil war looming, the fact we do not have a chief of staff has prompted concern among various political and military leaders. Thus they met with Huey Long to appoint a Chief of Staff to win this war, with the competition being mainly between three professional officers; Jacob "Smiling Jake" Devers is notably hated by Eisenhower and advocated for a mobilized army, J. Lawton "Lighting Joe" Collins favor a reliance on artillery and "Terrible" Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr, who advocates for advanced combat tactics and tactical planning. The right-wing of the AUS have doubts about each of these strategies and AFP leader Gerald L.K. Smith, with the backing of Charles Coughlin and many Silver Legion commanders, has put forward a more political solution to issue which relies on mass recruitment via populist christian recruitment and militancy, although favoring him will surely push the party right."
amcivwar.50.a: "Jacob "Smiling Jake" Devers"
amcivwar.50.b: "Lightning Joe Collins"
amcivwar.50.c: "Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr"
amcivwar.50.e: "Gerald L.K. Smith"

amcivwar.51.t: "Chief of Army"

amcivwar.52.b: "Lynne C. Quiggle"
amcivwar.52.c: "William Frederick Halsey Jr."

amcivwar.53.t: "Chief of Air Force"
amcivwar.53.d: "With the civil war looming, the fact we do not have a chief of the Air Force has prompted concern among various political and military leaders. Thus, they met with Huey Long to appoint a chief of the Air Force to win this war."
amcivwar.53.a: "James Fechet"
amcivwar.53.b: "Edwin Charles Parsons"
amcivwar.53.c: "William Thomas Ponder"

amcivwar.54.t: "Building a Loyal Navy"
amcivwar.54.d: "The admirals of the United States have prevented any of their ships from being liberated by the true patriots of America and thus we are deprived of a navy. However, we do have a number of admirals and sailors that are planning on building up a new navy. We do have quite a number of ships in Houston that we can convert to warships. We can either go with destroyers or cruisers. What shall we go for?"
amcivwar.54.a: "Destroyers"
amcivwar.54.b: "Cruisers"

### USA events ###

amcivwar.61.t: "Conscription"
amcivwar.61.d: "With the war going on the question, is should we implement conscription or not. Doing so would provide us with the men we need to restore order to the country. However, it is not a popular move. Some suggest focusing on Propaganda instead."
amcivwar.61.a: "Implement conscription"
amcivwar.61.b: "Focus on propaganda instead"

amcivwar.62.t: "Recall the China Marines?"
amcivwar.62.d: "With the outbreak of the civil war, our garrison in the Legation Cities has been left sitting on their hands in China. Though recalling the division would leave our Chinese concessions relatively unguarded, and our influence in the Cities smaller, many are advising us that it must be done to win the war. Should we recall the division?"
amcivwar.62.a: "Bring our boys home!"
amcivwar.62.b: "We shouldn't risk it."

amcivwar.63.t: "Panama Garrison"
amcivwar.63.d: "With the outbreak of the civil war, the garrison in Panama has decided to return to America to fight for the government. This has left the canal defenseless but on the other hand, we need everybody that we can to fight."
amcivwar.63.a: "Welcome the Boys home"

amcivwar.64.t: "Hardship of the civil war"
amcivwar.64.d: "The civil war is bringing the hardship home. People within a number of loyal cities are starving. We could focus on relieving their suffering, but this will mean diverting supplies that are needed for the front to fight the civil war. Congress and the Military are at odds in this regard. What should we do?"
amcivwar.64.a: "Relieve Civilian Suffering."
amcivwar.64.b: "Support our Troops."

amcivwar.65.t: "Martial Law?"
amcivwar.65.d: "With the civil war raging a question has come about suspending habeas corpus and enforcing martial law in occupied territories. Those within our General Staff are even divided, as it could create more rebels than it defeats pre-emptivly. It might allow us to keep things under control during the civil war but such a move is naturally controversial. What shall be done?"
amcivwar.65.a: "Enforce Martial Law"
amcivwar.65.b: "Civil order is better"

amcivwar.66.t: "Loyalist Terror"
amcivwar.66.d: "During the ongoing civil war, some of our commanders started to use rather doubtful methods to permanently suppress civilian populations suspected of helping our mortal enemies. When pressed, the President has defended their actions, stating 'Only discretionary violence was used, any commander capable of true brutality has already become a rebel'. "
amcivwar.66.a: "We can only hope."

amcivwar.67.t: "The Code Talkers"
amcivwar.67.d: "An ingenious missionary and educator from Flagstaff, Arizona named Philip Johnston has proposed the creation of the ‘Code Talker Program’ after his decades-long work with the Navajo Indians. Johnston has proposed that our administration and military command use the nearly-extinct languages of the various Amerindian tribes in a secret project aimed at hiding our communications by encrypting them using these native languages. By using the languages of the Navajo, Comanche, Assiniboine, Cherokee, Cree, Meshawki, Mohawk, Choctaw, Cree, Tlingit, and Muscogee peoples, we will create a code that can’t be cracked lest our enemies kidnap one of these native speakers themselves. Untranslatable without a native speaker, of which there are few and far between, this would give our intel and communications divisions an unmatched edge. The Code Talkers will be trained to never give up their intel, even if captured and tortured, and even if they must resort to suicide to prevent the leaking of classified information, and all will be kept far and away from any frontline. Our ciphers and codes will be uncrackable, and it is all thanks to the Indigenous peoples."
amcivwar.67.a: "We swore that we would protect the code with our lives, and we will keep our word."

amcivwar.68.t: "Conscientious Objectors"
amcivwar.68.d: "A number of men and women, particularly among religious like the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Mormons, do not wish to engage in war, have objected to fighting in the conflict. We can try to silence them or we can offer them to work in non-military jobs to help the war effort. Public opinion seems to be divided, as super-patriots have begun to assault objectors during their demonstrations."
amcivwar.68.a: "The public will handle them"
amcivwar.68.b: "Make them work"

amcivwar.69.t: "Double V Campaign"
amcivwar.69.d: "As we are fighting the various traitors, leaders of the NAACP have begun to push for what is being called the Double V Campaign, Victory for America and Victory against Racism. Not all African-Americans wish to fight for the radical factions and thus a campaign has begun to fight for America and to help win the civil war as well as to help fight against racism within America."
amcivwar.69.a: "Victory for America and Victory against Racism!"

amcivwar.70.t: "Militarize the WASPs?"
amcivwar.70.d: "Congress is debating a bill to militarize the Women Air Force Service Pilots(WASPs) in a similar fashion to the WACs and WAVES. This would require the government to provide the expenses for the WASPs similar to the other two organizations instead of having the female pilots themselves pay the expenses. It would not have them fly in combat situations, since that is still the job for the Male pilots. Despite this it is facing quite the pushback from Congress as many regard the WASPs as not as experienced as male pilots and not suited for the job. The question then is what shall congress vote to do?"
amcivwar.70.a: "Congress votes to Militarize the WASPs"
amcivwar.70.b: "Congress votes to not Militarize the WASPs"

amcivwar.71.t: "Chief of Staff"

amcivwar.800.t: "Chief of Staff"
amcivwar.800.d: "With the civil war looming, an emergency meeting of the leaders of the ODP and NDWL in Atlanta found President Murray having to choose between three quarelling candidates for the position of Chief of Staff. George Van Horn Moseley is by far the most experienced of the three, and is favored by the Fordists and respectable number of more mainstream ODP members. However, most of the ODP and NDWL fear giving Ford too much influence, and have put forth New Jersey Klan Grand Dragon Arthur Hornhui Bell as their choice for Chief of Staff. The Old Klan and Black Legion factions in the White Leagues however have their doubts about Bell's idealoglical commitment, and have been aggresively arguing that their own Virgil 'Bert' Effinger is best suited for the job."

### WCC Events ###

amcivwar.900.t: "The War Ahead"
amcivwar.900.d: "Eisenhower and Bradley have found themselves at the center of one of, if not the, greatest challenge the United States Army has ever faced. Their land they hold is dominated by the massive Rocky Mountains and southwestern deserts, is surrounded on all sides by new-found foes, and is crisscrossed by huge tracts of almost completely undeveloped land. It is obvious to both them and their staff that the odds are not in their favor. With this in mind, Bradley has urgently begun reorganizing the forces under his command to make the most of the poor situation and capitalize on the resources at hand and superior training of his loyal and professional forces. Inititives to bring local law enforcement, park rangers, and anyone even mildly qualified into a central Army command have aleady begun. If the WCC can hold, they will have turned America's darkest day into its finest hour."
amcivwar.900.a: "Godspeed"

amcivwar.901.t: "Recruitment Efforts"
amcivwar.901.d: "One of the few things in the WCCs favor is support from the local populace. Residents of WCC territories have begun mobilizing for the war effort. However, losses on the frontlines mean that even our recruitment of protective service forces will not be enough. Eisenhower will begin drafting a series of plans with local leaders to tap into every possible source of manpower available. However, former American Legion commander Alvin M. Owsley demands that aggressive drafts recruiting essentially every man who can shoot a gun should begin immediately. General George Kenney, who is currently serving as an effective 'voice of the Eastern Command' in MacArthur's place, supports this. Some civilian leaders such as Utah governor Henry H. Blood have caught wind of Owsley's measure are objecting to such radical orders despite the circumstances."
amcivwar.901.a: "Increase drafting immediately"
amcivwar.901.b: "Support Blood"

amcivwar.902.t: "Recruitment Efforts"
amcivwar.902.d: "Since siding with governor Blood, Owlsey has questioned our commitment to the Federal government, and stating that commitment to restoring America at all costs, from both leadership and common man, are required to win this war. Communications from MacArthur in the east indicate his backing of Owsley, but MacArthur presently lacks any meaningful authority over Bradley and the notice arrived too late to influence any decisions."
amcivwar.902.a: "This war is hard enough"

amcivwar.90.t: "Support from the Resistance"
amcivwar.90.d: "Rebels fighting for the [Root.GetAdjective] cause elsewhere in the United States have made contact with our government, offering an array of scaveneged supplies."
amcivwar.90.a: "It will be a great help"

amcivwar.91.t: "Support from Syndicalists"
amcivwar.91.d: "Rebels fighting for the [Root.GetAdjective] cause elsewhere in the United States have made contact with our government, offering an array of scaveneged supplies."
amcivwar.91.a: "It will be a great help."

amcivwar.92.t: "Support from Longists"

amcivwar.93.d: "Rebels fighting for the [Root.GetAdjective] cause elsewhere in the United States have made contact with our government, offering an array of scaveneged supplies."
amcivwar.93.a: "It will be a great help"

amcivwar.94.t: "Syndicalist Uprising in the West"
amcivwar.94.d: "Fighting along the West Coast between syndicalist sympathizers and security forces has been severe in recent weeks, but dropped off within the last weeks - leading to hopes that the unions out west had finally given up hope of success. These hopes were dashed as a new uprising was revealed, with a number of militias organized by powerful Teamster and Longshoremen unions in Washington and Oregon state and armed through underground efforts. This opens up a new front in the civil war, should the rebels find a way to break out of the mountains."
amcivwar.94.a: "Hurrah!"
amcivwar.94.b: "More syndicalist scum?!"

amcivwar.95.t: "Longist Rebels Rise in Kentucky"
amcivwar.95.d: "Huey Long always held strong support in the heartland, with states like Kentucky and Indiana only barely swinging elsewhere in the 1936 election. Now, Longist supporters have risen up in Kentucky and the surrounding region, taking up arms gained through the underground to band together and open a new front in the civil war."
amcivwar.95.a: "Hurrah!"
amcivwar.95.b: "This will not help them in the long run"

amcivwar.96.t: "Loyalists Rise in Pennsylvania"
amcivwar.96.d: "Support for the federal government remains strong even in the syndicalist heartland of Pennsylvania, and this has finally been proven as bands of loyalist militia -- reportedly organized in the city of Philadelphia -- rose up in the hills in the central part of the state, claiming the region once more for federal control. Whether they will achieve that goal and open up a new front in the civil war remains to be seen."
amcivwar.96.a: "Hurrah!"
amcivwar.96.b: "A futile effort"

amcivwar.97.t: "The [From.GetAdjective] Rebels"
amcivwar.97.d: "We are seeing increased activity by [From.GetAdjective] supporters in [Root.GetNameDef], no doubt supported and funded by the [From.GetAdjective] government. Their funneling of weapons through the underground has led up to rebels rising behind the lines, no doubt intended to harass our forces. Whether they will prove a serious threat remains to be seen."
amcivwar.97.a: "We shall endure"

amcivwar.98.t: "Resistance Rises in Midwest"
amcivwar.98.d: "Support for the democratic proponents in the Pacific government has been strong in the American Midwest, with several protests on the streets frequent - many of whom appear to be placing blame for the civil war squarely on the shoulders of General MacArthur. These protests have recently become more organized, and have culminated in a widespread uprising across Colorado, quietly funded and equipped through underground means. Whether these rebels will succeed in opening up a new front for the civil war remains to be seen."
amcivwar.98.a: "Hurrah!"
amcivwar.98.b: "A nuisance at best"

amcivwar.100.t: "Syndicalist Uprising in Georgia"
amcivwar.100.d: "It seems there are more than a few disaffected supporters of Huey Long who are angry enough that they've defected to the CSA's control. Over the last number of weeks, they've been organizing in the hills of southern Georgia, and now they've finally made their move. This opens up a new front in the civil war."
amcivwar.100.a: "Hurrah!"
amcivwar.100.b: "They should make up their minds"

amcivwar.102.t: "Longist Uprising in California"
amcivwar.102.d: "It seems there are more than a few disaffected SPA milita members who are angry enough that they've defected to the AUS's control. Over the last number of weeks, they've been organizing in the hills of southern California, and now they've finally made their move. This opens up a new front in the civil war."
amcivwar.102.a: "Hurrah!"
amcivwar.102.b: "It makes no difference"

amcivwar.125.t: "Bill Haywood Calls for Action"

amcivwar.127.d.long: "President [USA.GetLeader] experienced a major blow today as a large number of governors declared his government illegitimate, citing a direct link between the federal government and the recent assassination of Huey Long, and have thrown their support behind syndicalist leader Bill Haywood. They have stopped short of seceding from the Union, but have declared that the federal government holds no authority within their state borders until [USA.GetLeader] steps down and a 'reconciliation council' under their chosen leader is put into place to restore order in the nation. In response, President [USA.GetLeader] has given the governors thirty days to stand down or be collectively arrested - an order none of them appear interested in obeying, making it all but certain that the United States will descend into civil war for the second time in less than a century."
amcivwar.127.d.austerity: "While President [USA.GetLeader] celebrated a recent victory by passing a massive austerity bill meant to rescue the United States economy, one which had exacted a compromise from Huey Long and his supporters in the radical America First Party, the bill had the opposite effect on syndicalists and their leader, Bill Haywood. Today a large number of northern governors have declared the Federal government illegitimate, having abandoned the American worker, and thrown their support behind Bill Haywood.

From Chicago, Bill Haywood's supporters have declared MacArthur's government illegitimate - as has the southern supporters of Huey Long, based in New Orleans, and the Pacific Governors under the leadership of Governor Frank Merriam.

### Foreign Interventions

amcivwar.150.t: "America in Chaos"
amcivwar.150.d: "Chaos has overtaken our neighbours to the south, and - even worse - the Socialist Party of America has proclaimed a stronghold right off our southern border. A number of the northeastern governors in New England, their states beset by syndicalist militia violence, have formally asked the Canadian government to intervene. Clearly they feel the Federal government is incapable of the task, though some of our ministers feel this might be seen by some of the factions less as intervention and more as aggression. They say the matter should be debated in Parliament before any action is taken. For New England, at least, that might not be quick enough to save them."
amcivwar.150.d.nocsa: "Chaos has overtaken our neighbours to the south, though it seems as if we are spared the possibility of an American syndicalist uprising. Even so, the violence has been extreme and several governors of American states from the northeast in New England have asked us to intervene and restore order. Clearly they feel the Federal government is incapable of the task, though some of our ministers feel this might be seen by the Federal government less as intervention and more as aggression. They say the matter should be debated in Parliament before any action is taken."
amcivwar.150.a: "Hold off on any intervention"
amcivwar.150.b: "Move into New England, as requested"

amcivwar.151.t: "Alaska Requests Intervention"
amcivwar.151.d: "The American territory of Alaska has experienced a severe shortage of needed supplies following the outbreak of the civil war. After a recent bombing in the city of Juneau, the Alaska governor is fearing a breakdown of order - one that the far-off Federal government will be too busy to respond to. Thus he, like the New England governors, has requested that the Canadian government intervene for the interim to keep the peace."
amcivwar.151.a: "Alaska is on its own"
amcivwar.151.b: "We should move in"

amcivwar.152.t: "[CAN.GetNameDefCap] Seizes Alaska"
amcivwar.152.d: "The territory of Alaska has experienced a severe shortage of needed supplies following the outbreak of the civil war. After a recent bombing in the city of Juneau, the Alaska governor feared a breakdown of order - one that the far-off Federal government will be too busy to respond to - and thus made a formal request to [CAN.GetNameDef] that they intervene. Canadian troops and supply trucks have already moved into the region."
amcivwar.152.a: "We will deal with this later"

amcivwar.153.t: "A Proxy Government in Alaska?"
amcivwar.153.d: "The territory of Alaska is now under Canadian control, however our command over the region is loose and local resistance is high. To remedy this, many are suggesting putting a proxy government in control of Alaska to better help administer the region. The commonly suggestion man to head this administration would be George Pearkes, who has served in the Alaskan region beforehand. "
amcivwar.153.a: "Send Pearkes"
amcivwar.153.b: "Keep Alaska"

amcivwar.156.t: "The Fate of America"

amcivwar.157.d.notsupported: "[From.GetNameDefCap] occupied a fair emount of American territory during the civil war. Now their government has approached us, returning much of it to its 'rightful owner', no questions asked."

amcivwar.158.t: "American Land Returned"
amcivwar.158.d: "Our Canadian allies, true to their word, have turned over almost all their occupied American territory to us."
amcivwar.158.a: "We appreciate it"

amcivwar.159.t: "A New American Government"
amcivwar.159.d: "With the former governments in tatters, we will need to establish something from the old. What form shall the new government take?"

amcivwar.159.b: "The Pacific States of America"
amcivwar.159.c: "The American Union State"
amcivwar.159.e: "New England"

amcivwar.160.t: "The Fate of New England"

amcivwar.162.d: "It's been over a year since the new government was established in [america_country.GetNameDef], and our allies there say they are ready to stand on their own feet again. Shall we allow them to hold elections and continue on as free allies?"
amcivwar.162.a: "Of course"
amcivwar.162.b: "They're not ready"

amcivwar.163.t: "Peace with Canada?"
amcivwar.163.d: "We have occupied Ottawa, and currently have the Canadians on the run. Perhaps the time has come to make peace, lest we find ourselves dragged down in their expansive territory."
amcivwar.163.a: "Very well, let's end this"
amcivwar.163.b: "Only if they cede British Columbia to us"

amcivwar.164.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks for Peace"
amcivwar.164.d: "We have received an envoy from the [From.GetAdjective] government, saying they have occupied enough of Canada and hope we have learned an abject lesson. They're willing to consider peace, though warn us severely that next time they will not be so lenient."
amcivwar.164.a: "Yes, let's end this"
amcivwar.164.b: "No, we can still win!"

amcivwar.165.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks for Peace"
amcivwar.165.d: "The Canadian government, having been beaten soundly by [From.From.GetNameDef], wishes to pull out completely from its involvement in the civil war, and thus has asked for peace with [Root.GetNameDef]."
amcivwar.165.a: "Yes, let's end this"
amcivwar.165.b: "We intend to teach them a lesson"

amcivwar.166.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap]'s Proposal"
amcivwar.166.d: "We are currently in a ceasefire with [CSA.GetNameDef], but none of us are under the illusion that this is anything more than a respite before the fighting resumes. The [From.GetAdjective] government has approached us with a proposal: if we join the Entente, they'll fight on our side when the battle resumes. It makes sense, considering that the Canadians fear [CSA.GetNameDef] as much as we do, but some in our government oppose the idea of leashing ourselves to the Entente cause. We will, after all, be locked into their wars in Europe even should we win the civil war now."
amcivwar.166.a: "We need their help to win the war"
amcivwar.166.b: "No, we will do this without their help"

amcivwar.1641.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks for Land Concessions"
amcivwar.1641.d: "We have received an envoy from the [From.GetAdjective] government, saying they have occupied enough of Canada and hope we have learn an abject lesson. They're willing to consider peace, though they demand the territories of British Columbia and Vancouver Island be transferred to them." 
amcivwar.1641.a: "Yes, let's end this"
amcivwar.1641.b: "No, we can still win!"

amcivwar.1642.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks for New England"
amcivwar.1642.d: "We have received an envoy from the [From.GetAdjective] government, saying they have occupied enough of Canada and hope we have learn an abject lesson. They're willing to consider peace, though they demand we call off our support for the New Englander government immediately." 
amcivwar.1642.a: "Yes, let's end this"
amcivwar.1642.b: "No, we can still win!"

amcivwar.167.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Joins the Entente"
amcivwar.167.d: "Grateful for our assistance, the [From.GetAdjective] government has chosen to accept our offer and has formally joined the Entente."
amcivwar.167.a: "Three Cheers for America!"

amcivwar.168.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Rejects our Offer"
amcivwar.168.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has rejected our alliance offer, perhaps believing that they can win the civil war on their own."
amcivwar.168.a: "How disappointing!"

amcivwar.169.t: "[CAL.GetNameDefCap] Joins the Entente"
amcivwar.169.d: "Obviously fearing our ultimate victory, the [CAL.GetAdjective] government has cozied up to the Canadians and the British. We will need to fight them all, once the ceasefire is done."
amcivwar.169.a: "So be it!"

amcivwar.199.t: "Last America Standing"
amcivwar.199.d: "It is beginning to dawn upon our citizens that the American civil war is actually over. The scars from the fighting will last for a long time, but it seems as if the feeling has already started to sink in that any chance to change America's destiny further has passed. We are now and forever more [Root.GetNameDef], and the world should know that is so."
amcivwar.199.a: "God bless America!"


### Rocky Mountain Ceasefire ###

amcivwar.200.t: "A Possible Ceasefire"
amcivwar.200.d: "The civil war has ravaged America, and there is a growing discussion within the government regarding approaching [CAL.GetNameDef] for a possible ceasefire. Whether the Pacific rebels would even consider such a thing is unknown, but if it occurred it would give us time to consolidate our hold over the east and for our men to recover. Eventually a reckoning would be necessary, of course, but if we don't attempt this now the war may drag on even longer as a result."
amcivwar.200.a: "Let's meet them in Denver"
amcivwar.200.b: "No, there's no point in this"

amcivwar.201.t: "Ceasefire Talks in Denver"
amcivwar.201.d: "With the war between [survivor.GetNameDef] and [CAL.GetNameDef] dragging on, talks have been held between highly-placed officials on both sides regarding a possible ceasefire. This comes at the urging of the [survivor.GetAdjective] government, though it's unknown just how much traction there currently is. We shall see within a couple of days whether anything comes of it."
amcivwar.201.a: "An interesting idea?"

amcivwar.202.t: "The Proposal"
amcivwar.202.d: "After two days of talks, army officials have put together a proposal: any states west of the Mississippi River which are currently occupied by [CAL.GetAdjective] forces would be ceded to [CAL.GetNameDef], with some gaps filled in on the map - though nothing they can't properly supply. The rest would be ceded to [survivor.GetNameDef]. Outside of that, there are no guarantees and no talk of actual peace... eventually there will be a reckoning. Both sides simply call for hostilities to stop for now, for damage to be assessed, and for the living to take a much-needed breath."
amcivwar.202.a: "This will do."
amcivwar.202.b: "They're asking for too much!"
ACW_agree_proposal: "Agree to the proposal as it stands"
ACW_we_will_try_again: "We will go back to the table and try again..."

amcivwar.203.t: "There Will be no Ceasefire"
amcivwar.203.d: "Perhaps it was too much to hope for. Talks between both sides in Denver fell apart without any real agreement, and any hopes for a ceasefire have vanished. The war resumes."
amcivwar.203.a: "So much for that"

amcivwar.204.t: "The [ACW_ceasefire_name]"
amcivwar.204.d: "Talks with [CAL.GetNameDef] have concluded, and the ceasefire is going ahead. Already our troops are pulling back to the eastern side of the new border. How long this will last remains to be seen."

amcivwar.2042.a: "So much for that"

amcivwar.2043.t: "The war resumes"
amcivwar.2043.d: "Perhaps it was too much to hope for. New talks between both sides in Denver fell apart without any real agreement, and any hopes for a permanent agreement have vanished. The war resumes."

amcivwar.205.a: "It's peace for now"

amcivwar.206.t: "The [ACW_ceasefire_name]"
amcivwar.206.d: "Civil war has ravaged America for many months, but today a ceasefire was called in the conflict after a meeting in Denver between officials of [CAL.GetNameDef] and [survivor.GetNameDef] worked out terms. Pacific forces would withdraw to new boundaries west of the agreed-upon border, while [survivor.GetAdjective] forces would withdraw eastward. This is not an official peace, however, and many feel that a future reckoning between the two countries - a final showdown, as it were, for the future destiny of America - is all but inevitable. Even so, this is a moment of respite for each side to gather their strength and count their dead, and Americans on both sides are celebrating a bit of peace snatched from the jaws of chaos."
amcivwar.206.a: "We'll see how long it lasts"

### Liberia and Philippines in Chaos ###

amcivwar.212.t: "America in Chaos"
amcivwar.212.d: "Liberia has been under the economic and effective political dominance of the USA since its foundation as a colony for freed slaves in 1822. This dominance has also helped to protect her from European colonial powers. However, now the USA is in chaos, as rival political factions make a bid for the Presidency. The conflict has now deepened to the point of war. No longer can they be relied upon for protection. Now we must decide how we are to survive."

amcivwar.226.d: "The civil war in America has left the American hold over the Philippines weakened. The people of the Philippines are demanding full independence but some in the government are worried that an independent Philippines will be absorbed by the greater powers in the area."
amcivwar.226.a: "Freedom. Horrible, horrible freedom"

amcivwar.227.t: "Seizing American Equipment"
amcivwar.227.d: "With the Americans heading off the island, they have left large amounts of equipment in the Philippines. The Filipino army is advocating seizing the resources while they are unguarded but the government is afraid of what this might do to the relations between the two countries."
amcivwar.227.a: "Seize the equipment"
amcivwar.227.b: "We should stay friendly"

amcivwar.228.t: "The American Mission in the Philippines"
amcivwar.228.d: "The war has forced the US government to recall all available units. The American forces in the Philippines are still loyal to the US government and Douglas MacArthur. Some are concerned that abandoning the Philippines will be costly but the forces are needed in America."
amcivwar.228.a: "Recall the units"
amcivwar.228.b: "We must hold our position"

amcivwar.229.t: "The Philippine Commonwealth"
amcivwar.229.d: "The Americans had never promised the Filipino people independence and forces inside the country wanted to use the American Civil War as an opportunity to declare independence and form a legitimate government. The Commonwealth of the Philippines was created to administer the nation and transition into a full state of independence."
amcivwar.229.a: "Our glorious new commonwealth"

### Pre-War Events ###
amcivwar.300.t: "Riots in New England and New York"
amcivwar.300.d: "In recent days, syndicalist militias have been struggling (and failing) to take control in northeastern states, from New York and New Jersey all the way up to the coasts of Maine. So far, governors in the region have clamped down hard on the violence, though the result has been a series of violent riots in Boston and Buffalo - not to mention a wave of uprisings still ongoing within New York City itself. Citizens are on edge, and governors have denied the federal government permission to raise local militias in the area, fearful of increasing tensions further. A few New England governors are reported to be quietly asking the Canadian government to intervene, should worse come to worst."
amcivwar.300.d.assass: "The fallout of Bill Haywood's assassination has been felt throughout the north, but the violence is particularly intense throughout the northeastern states from New Jersey all the way up to the coasts of Maine. Several groups of SPA militia are suggesting they rise up along with the AUS, united or not, and are attempting to seize control of the area. So far, governors in the region have clamped down hard on the violence, though the result has been a series of riots in Boston and Buffalo - not to mention a wave of uprisings still ongoing within New York City itself. Citizens are on edge, and governors have denied the federal government permission to raise local militias in the area, fearful of increasing tensions further. A few New England governors are reported to be quietly asking the Canadian government to intervene, should worse come to worst."
amcivwar.300.d.peace: "While Bill Haywood and the SPA have been trying to rein in their militias across the north, not all are in agreement that the compromise bill went far enough. Indeed, several more radical unions are still calling for strikes, and the northeastern states - from New Jersey all the way up to the coast of Maine - have been particularly hard-hit by militia violence. So far, governors in the region have clamped down on them hard, though the result has been a series of violent riots in Boston and Buffalo - not to mention a wave of uprisings still ongoing within New York City itself. Citizens are on edge, and governors have denied the federal government permission to raise local militias in the area, fearful of increasing tensions further. A few New England governors are reported to be quietly asking the Canadian government to intervene, should worse come to worst."
amcivwar.300.a: "What a mess"
amcivwar.300.b: "Interesting"

amcivwar.310.t: "Nevada Aligns with Pacific States"
amcivwar.310.d: "Richard Kirman, Sr. today declared Nevada's allegiance with the Pacific States who refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of General MacArthur's government. The governor had been in consultation with the Pacific government since its creation, and in a radio address said he could not stand by and let democracy fail in America without taking a stand. So far, federal forces have withdrawn from army bases in the region without threat of further violence."
amcivwar.310.a: "A welcome decision"
amcivwar.310.b: "A foolish decision"

amcivwar.311.t: "The 30 Day Deadline"
amcivwar.311.d: "The 30-day deadline by the federal government to the rebellious states has, so far, gone without any of the state governors changing their minds. The federal government is consolidating its position, but has warned MacArthur to expect further violence and state defections prior to the deadline's end. Most in Washington appear pessimistic that an all-out war can be avoided."
amcivwar.311.a: "We shall see"
amcivwar.311.b: "Unlikely"

amcivwar.312.t: "Deadline Looms"
amcivwar.312.d: "The 30-day deadline issued by the federal government is almost at an end, with none of the sides having stood down. Indeed, it's clear the rebellious states have used the intervening time to raise militias throughout their controlled areas, meaning a civil war will be a difficult fight, indeed."
amcivwar.312.a: "What comes shall come"

amcivwar.313.t: "Contact with the New York Resistance"
amcivwar.313.d: "Though both New York and New Jersey were thought completely lost to Federal forces, it turns out that several large groups of fighters managed to make it out of the urban areas, and have regrouped in the hills of eastern Pennsylvania. Though tattered, they are eager to continue the battle with our support."
amcivwar.313.a: "Good to have you, boys"
CSA_four_units_newyork: "Four militia units arrive in Pennsylvania"

amcivwar.314.t: "Order Restored in [restored_core.GetName]"
amcivwar.314.d: "Over the past weeks, [Root.GetAdjective] government forces have been busy in [restored_core.GetName], arresting those we feel would prove a hindrance to our control and helping our local supporters spreading the good word amongst the people. We want to reassure them that, as American citizens, they have no reason to fear our presence. Our efforts have slowly begun to bear fruit, even in the midst of all this chaos."
amcivwar.314.a: "Excellent news!"

### Black Belt Integration ###

amcivwar.503.t: "Support the Black Belt?"
amcivwar.503.d: "The CAR is apparently having some trouble containing the Black Belt during the war, leading to requests from local rebels, especially radicals, to aid them in their efforts. While it may be a high price, it would damage their control of the region."
amcivwar.503.a: "Send Funds"
amcivwar.503.b: "Decline"

amcivwar.504.t: "Support the Black Belt?"
amcivwar.504.d: "The CAR is apparently having some trouble containing the Black Belt during the war, leading to requests from local rebels, especially radicals, to aid them in their efforts. While it may be a high price, it would damage their control of the region."
amcivwar.504.a: "Send Funds"
amcivwar.504.b: "Decline"

amcivwar.505.t: "Black Belt offers reintegration"
amcivwar.505.d: "The Black has offered to reintegrate to the United States if we grant them additional autonomy, ensure equal rights to Black Americans, create a government bureau devoted to ensuring equal hiring rights, illegalize White Leagues and pay 'restorations' to the Black Belt. While costly, the Black Belt may well be worth it. On the other hand, we could take it by force."
amcivwar.505.a: "Agree"
amcivwar.505.b: "To Battle!"

### Sanity Checks ###

amcivwar.600.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Collapse"
amcivwar.600.d: "Our forces cannot hold out against the enemy any longer - already our troops are beginning to desert en masse, and the ripple of disorganization is working its way up the ranks. [Root.GetNameDefCap] is near the point of defeat, and we must admit that it is so."
amcivwar.600.a: "Thus it ends here..."

amcivwar.607.t: "The Federal Collapse"
amcivwar.607.d.lives: "It appears that the Federal government is on its last legs in the American Civil War. Already most of its land has been swallowed up by [annex_to.GetNameDef] and other American factions, and what is left is but the last remnants of its army - now demoralized and suffering from mass desertions, but holding out against all hope that a miracle might save them. Some Federal leaders have already met with [annex_to.GetAdjective] generals to negotiate the terms of their inevitable complete surrender."
amcivwar.607.d.falls: "News travelled quickly today that the Federal government has collapsed in the American Civil War. What land was formerly under its control has been swallowed up by the other American factions, and the last remaining Federal leaders were reported to have met with generals from [annex_to.GetNameDef] in order to negotiate the terms of their complete surrender. The whereabouts of [USA.GetLeader] is unknown, but he is also believed to have already been placed under arrest. The future of the United States, it appears, rests in the hands of the factions which tore it down."
amcivwar.607.a: "A necessary step for the revolution."
amcivwar.607.b: "Sic Semper Tyrannis!"
amcivwar.607.c: "They got what they deserved"
amcivwar.607.e: "Shocking!"

amcivwar.608.t: "Collapse of the American Syndicates"
amcivwar.608.d.lives: "It appears that the Syndicate government is on its last legs in the American Civil War. Already most of its land has been swallowed up by [annex_to.GetNameDef] and other American factions, and what is left is but the last remnants of its army - now demoralized and suffering from mass desertions, but holding out against all hope that a miracle might save them. Some Syndicate leaders have already met with [annex_to.GetAdjective] generals to negotiate the terms of their inevitable complete surrender."
amcivwar.608.d.falls: "News travelled quickly today that the [CSA.GetNameDef] government has collapsed in the American Civil War. What land was formerly under its control has been swallowed up by the other American factions, and the last remaining Syndicate leaders were reported to have met with generals from [annex_to.GetNameDef] in order to negotiate the terms of their complete surrender. The whereabouts of [CSA.GetLeader] is unknown, but he is believed to have already been placed under arrest. The threat that the United States will fall to syndicalism has, it appears, come to an end."
amcivwar.608.a: "It's about damned time"
amcivwar.608.b: "Well that's good news, at least"
amcivwar.608.c: "Let their revolution burn in hell"
amcivwar.608.e: "Interesting."

amcivwar.609.t: "Collapse of the Union"
amcivwar.609.d.lives: "It appears that the Union government is on its last legs in the American Civil War. Already most of its land has been swallowed up by [annex_to.GetNameDef] and other American factions, and what is left is but the last remnants of its army - now demoralized and suffering from mass desertions, but holding out against all hope that a miracle might save them. Some Union leaders have already met with [annex_to.GetAdjective] generals to negotiate the terms of their inevitable complete surrender."
amcivwar.609.d.falls: "News travelled quickly today that the Union government has collapsed in the American Civil War. What land was formerly under its control has been swallowed up by the other American factions, and the last remaining Union leaders were reported to have met with generals from [annex_to.GetNameDef] in order to negotiate the terms of their complete surrender. The whereabouts of [TEX.GetLeader] is unknown, but he is believed to have already been placed under arrest. The threat that the United States will fall sway to [TEX.GetNameDef]'s radical ideology, it appears, come to an end."
amcivwar.609.a: "As it should be"
amcivwar.609.b: "Well that's good news, at least"
amcivwar.609.c: "They deserve everything they get"
amcivwar.609.e: "Interesting"

amcivwar.610.t: "Collapse of the Pacific States"
amcivwar.610.d.lives: "It appears that the Pacific States government is on its last legs in the American Civil War. Already most of its land has been swallowed up by [annex_to.GetNameDef] and other American factions, and what is left is but the last remnants of its army - now demoralized and suffering from mass desertions, but holding out against all hope that a miracle might save them. Some leaders have already met with [annex_to.GetAdjective] generals to negotiate the terms of their inevitable complete surrender."
amcivwar.610.d.falls: "News travelled quickly today that the Pacific States government has collapsed in the American Civil War. What land was formerly under its control has been swallowed up by the other American factions, and the last remaining loyalist leaders were reported to have met with generals from [annex_to.GetNameDef] in order to negotiate the terms of their complete surrender. The whereabouts of [CAL.GetLeader] is unknown, but he is also believed to have already been placed under arrest. The future of the United States, it appears, rests in the hands of the factions which tore it down."
amcivwar.610.a: "As it should be"
amcivwar.610.b: "Well that's good news, at least"
amcivwar.610.c: "They deserve everything they get"
amcivwar.610.e: "Interesting"

amcivwar.611.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Equipment Arrives"
amcivwar.611.d: "Our friends in [From.GetNameDef] have sent us a shipment of infantry equipment to aid in our struggle."
amcivwar.611.a: "Much needed!"

amcivwar.615.t: "Emergency Reserves Called Up"
amcivwar.615.d: "With the declaration of war on [Root.GetNameDef] by [From.GetNameDef], veterans of the civil war scrambled to enlist in the national reserves - compelled by a feeling that the [From.GetAdjective] government was preying upon us at our weakest moment. While the new corps are spread all over the country, they are ready and eager to fight against the enemy!"
amcivwar.615.a: "They shall pay for this!"

amcivwar.616.t: "Reserves Demobilized"
amcivwar.616.d: "While the emergency reserves were called up for the war, now that it is over they have been demobilized and sent back to their homes - exhausted after so much fighting."
amcivwar.616.a: "Time to rest, dear veterans"

amcivwar.617.t: "The Vatican offers Military Aid"
amcivwar.617.d: "In a rather surprising gesture of solidarity, the Vatican, under the auspices of the current Pope, has extended the offer of both weapons and supplies to the Union State. Even better, they have gone so far as to send fighting men, many of them formed from the ranks of French and Italian volunteers, to aid the Minutemen in freeing America from corruption and syndicalism. This has come as a shock to the administration; it's been well known that America is largely Protestant with the Catholic population, whilst large as well, mostly residing in the greater area of New England, some of them only living as far south as southern Maryland, all well out of the reach of the American Union State at present.\n\n However, Texas has a significant Catholic population, and Louisiana has Catholic sympathies as well, making it a reasonable offer on the part of the Pope. While [TEX.getleader] personally would attribute this gesture to traditional Catholic virtues of charity and diligence, as most would, some among the upper echelons of the goverment, particularly the devout Protestant Gerald L. K. Smith, despise the notion of Roman Catholic intervention, urging [TEX.getleader] to refute any attempt by the Vatican to potentially expand their influence in North America. In particular, they cite the Catholic unrest in Mexico as an example of the Papacy's 'corrosive attempt to uproot the values of the Free World'. While one can easily dismiss Smith's ravings as unfair and bigoted, the ultimate decision rests with [TEX.getleader]."
amcivwar.617.a: "Send our thanks to His Holiness, but we have things under control."
amcivwar.617.b: "Smith's just being paranoid, we need rifles, damn it!"

amcivwar.618.t: "Packing Our Bags"
amcivwar.618.d: "It has become clear that the tide of war has turned decisively out of our favor, and that collapse of our scant troops is immanent. The clock is ticking, and the Military High command is beginning to draft a plan to evacuate our remaining Government Officials. This would also include smuggling President Long on to a plane bound for Paraguay, along with his family and a few other trusted government officials. "
amcivwar.618.a: "What choice do I have?"
amcivwar.618.b: "I will fight to the end!"

### Black Legion Resistance ###

amcivwar.619.t: "Terror of the Black Legion"
amcivwar.619.d: "The Black Legion is a grouping of extreme NDWL members whom view even the 'mainstream' Klan as too moderate and harken back to the First Klan under Forrest and White League groups such as Benjamin Tillman's Red Shirts leading to them and their allies being nicknamed "The Old Klan". Recently their opposition to our government as caused them to be more than just a thorn in our side and we must now counter the group to prevent their continued attacks on our officials, civilians and, when occasionally organized well-enough, supply lines."
amcivwar.619.a: "Lunatics!"
amcivwar.619.b: "Traitors!"

amcivwar.620.t: "Black Legion Resistance Grows"
amcivwar.620.d: "The Black Legion has continued to grow in recruitment size, taking up those who view them as their best chance at stomping out radicals, liberals, black activists, securing a more secure position for themselves and/or simply those using them as an excuse to act out their more sadistic impulses. The terror they inspire in the civilian population is slowing economic and political activity and tied up our forces in the backlines to subdue to them."
amcivwar.620.a: "We need to end this!"

amcivwar.621.t: "Black Legion Resistance Continues to Grow"
amcivwar.621.d: "The Black Legion has continued to grow in recruitment size and is becoming a greater threat to our population, with those who fall under their targeted groups often looking out of Legion activity and those who don't often being too scared to report them anyways. As they seemingly ambush and kill anyone perceived opponent they think they can get their hands on, it's clear this needs to come to an end if we are to restore stability."
amcivwar.621.a: "Monsters!"

amcivwar.6210.t: "Overwhelming Black Legion Resistance"
amcivwar.6210.d: "The Black Legion's terrorist activities are nearly constant at this point as well have been unable to subdue them. Activity in their strongholds has caused daily life to come to a near standstill and the government to lose much of its legitimacy. This is truly a dark hour for America."
amcivwar.6210.a: "Stomp them out now!"

amcivwar.622.t: "Black Legion Goes Undergroud!"
amcivwar.622.d: "The Black Legions grip has slipped as their members are being stomped out and they feel less safe being so open in their acitivies in their stronholds. They have returned to being a far more underground terrorist clique."
amcivwar.622.a: "It's a start"
amcivwar.622.b: "They have no chance"

amcivwar.623.t: "Black Legion wounded!"
amcivwar.623.d: "The Black Legions influence has fallen and the widely despised group is seeing more citizens being willing to report their whereabouts and members. They are no longer able to conduct terror activities as widely as they could."
amcivwar.623.a: "Let's keep it up"
amcivwar.623.b: "They have no chance"

amcivwar.624.t: "Black Legion loses support!"
amcivwar.624.d: "The Black Legion has seen crushing defeats, low recruitment and increasing opposition, leaving it closer to being the irritating (if violent) gang it orginally was than paramilitary force it became. We might be able to finish them off altogether if we keep up the presure!"
amcivwar.624.a: "Excellent!"

amcivwar.625.t: "Black Legion in Retreat!"
amcivwar.625.d: "The Black Legion has been utterly broken, with captured members selling one another out, their funds destroyed and most of their militants either dead or in retreat. It appears that the Black Legion has been defeated, and the government announcement that the Black Legion is in shambles has been met with celebration from citizens who can return to their lives with less fear in their lives."
amcivwar.625.a: "Justice at last!"

### Socialist Resistance ###

amcivwar.626.t: "Socialist Militancy!"
amcivwar.626.d: "The militant wing of the IWW, the Red Guard, and other anarchist and socialist militants, have grown in recent weeks. Generally moving beyond striking they have begun a campaign of industrial sabotage, targeted political assasinations, supply disruption and doubling down on militant propaganda designed to appeal to urban workers. These combined efforts are generally damaging our economy, especially our ability to produce raw industrial goods."
amcivwar.626.a: "Damn!"

amcivwar.627.t: "Anarchist resistance rises!"
amcivwar.627.d: "Anarchists have caused even more problems for us in recent days as they target our supply lines, especially our industrial production, and our supporters are becoming intimidated by their increased numbers and aggressiveness. Our politicians and wealthier supporters in particular are fearful of violent reprisals and pot shots taken at them but even others are not safe as anyone of place of business seen as 'petit-bourgeoisie collaborators' are declared targets of the Red Guards and other CSA affiliated groups. We must end this anarchist wave of violence."
amcivwar.627.a: "Fanatical madmen!"

amcivwar.628.t: "Anarchist Violence Spreads!"
amcivwar.628.d: "Anarchist violence has reached a tipping point as their campaign grows increasingly violent and frenzied alongside their numbers. With the Red Guard, and especially it's so-called Galleanist Collectivist wings endorsing ever more extreme measures of the Propaganda of the Deed middle and upper class districts are being bombed, priests and even smaller businessmen are being shipped timed explosives and shots are being fired at factory owners. While some socialists politicans (espeically pacifists) in the CSA have decired this the rest are either silent or supportive but our cries of the CSA being a terrorist state mean little next to the damage they are doing."
amcivwar.628.a: "Animals!"

amcivwar.629.t: "The Red Terror!"
amcivwar.629.d: "Our claims of having the anarchist threat under control are reaching deaf ears as increasing numbers of urban workers expect them to completely destroy our efforts, citizens are too terrified to anser mail, churches are on lockdown and politicians are demanding we immediently stop their terror campaign. The Red Terror has practically brought our economy to a halt, organizing our forces infintely more difficult then need be and the workers they target in their propaganda efforts have increasingly extremely questionable sympathies."
amcivwar.629.a: "We must end this!"

amcivwar.630.t: "Socialists disrupted!"
amcivwar.630.d: "Socialists organizations have been broken up in recent weeks, collapsing coordination between them. While this is hardly the end of this Red Menace they are at least not wantonly spreading a full blown terror as they once were with locals being more confident in giving information on Gallenists and Collectivists especially. Finally our industry has a chance to at least partially recover from their sabotage."
amcivwar.630.a: "Very Well!"

amcivwar.631.t: "Socialist Militias stumble!"
amcivwar.631.d: "The Red Guard militias have seen a fall in support recently as their militias continue to suffer from crackdowns and low recruitment rates. Politically fence-sitting workers are increasingly viewing us the future and industrial sabotage is falling."
amcivwar.631.a: "Absolutely wonderful!"
amcivwar.631.b: "Good enough!"

amcivwar.632.t: "Red Guards on their last legs"
amcivwar.632.d: "Red Guard Militias have seen blow after blow and are forced to resort to their more base tactics of ever more basic industrial sabotage and worker recruitment as they lack almost any ability to coordinate amongst each other and workers are overwhelmingly unwilling to join their cause even passively. It appears we may win this fight afterall."
amcivwar.632.a: "Of course we will!"

amcivwar.633.t: "Socialist Militias finished!"
amcivwar.633.d: "The socialist militias as any sort of force capable of stalling the economy or frightening our supporters is finished. While there will always be a handful of fanatical Reds willing to die for their cause it nonehteless appears these extremists are finished as a large scale threat, to the joy of our supporters."
amcivwar.633.a: "Great!"

### Minutemen Resistance ###

amcivwar.634.t: "Rise of the Minutemen!"
amcivwar.634.d: "The AUS-Longist alligned Minutemen have begun organizing in our territory, targeting farmers, the unemployed, the rural poor and the middle class for recruitment. With a goal of targeting our supply lines and disrupting troop coordination these rebels are inclined to loot our supply caches and encourage farmers to hide their goods from the state, resorting to destroying the crops of farmers who are allied with us. They have likewise adopted a positive attitude towards psychological warfare thanks to the advice of AFP military advisors such as Frank Hamer, killing our our officers, militants and organizers in particularly gruesome ways when the opportunity arises and conducting night raids sporadically."
amcivwar.634.a: "Bastards!"

amcivwar.6340.t: "The Minutemen Attack!"
amcivwar.6340.d: "The Minutemen have been increasing their coordination between themselves and the AFP, raiding our supply lines with increasing infrequency, murdering and mutiliating our low ranking officials and torturing captured officers for information they pass between themsevles. Their night attacks on our sentries has likewise seen widespread fear amongst our troops. With farmers increasingly viewing them as viable contenders in the ACW more and more are agreeing to hide their supplies out of either genuinie support or fear and unemployed men are dodging our recruitment efforts as AFP propaganda is directing them to do."
amcivwar.6340.a: "Find them!"

amcivwar.635.t: "Minutemen Support Grows"
amcivwar.635.d: "The Minutemen have not only not lost support but have increased it, and as a result we are dangerously low on supplies that are being either raided, burned or hidden by their agrarian supporters. Meanwhile our formerly vocal recruiters and on-the-ground officials have grown increasingly fearful of conducting their work without meeting grizzly ends and sentries must be deployed in increasingly large numbers to avoid potential ambushes. Worst yet their middle-class and unemployed support base has grown as their increasingly coordinated efforts make attempts to appeal to them and promise them a better future under the AFP, encouraging them to withhold any support they can from our government."
amcivwar.635.a: "Damn it!"

amcivwar.636.t: "The Long-Armed Menace!"
amcivwar.636.d: "The AFP's attempts to use the Minutemen to disrupt our activities has reached an all-time high with our military officers traveling with increasingly large numbers of guards to prevent kidnapping and certain death from the Minutemen. More activists are keeping quiet, supply caches require massive troop deployments to reliably protect, night-raids have never been more frequent and the loyalties of farmers, the middle-class and unemployed men who used to be middle-class themselves has never been more questionable. We must end the AFP's attacks on our supplies and officials at once!"
amcivwar.636.a: "Bastards!"

amcivwar.637.t: "Minutemen Disrupted!"
amcivwar.637.d: "The Minutemen have been losing supporters and militants in recent days, and with it the ability to coordinate as well thanks to our disruptions of their terrorism. While there is still a long ways to go our break over their control of supplies and farm goods as given our population some respite from their ruthless endeavors, and officers can conduct their works more efficiently."
amcivwar.637.a: "Keep it up!"

amcivwar.638.t: "Minutemen pushed back!"
amcivwar.638.d: "Minutemen bases are being exposed in increasingly large numbers and our soldiers are enthused to hear that their campaign of terrorizing them is being met with a return of force. As farmers view the AFP as a cause on the fritz they are less willing to listen to their demands, our supply caches are arriving more safety and our officials can more easily do their work. Nonethless there is a ways to go to finish the job."
amcivwar.638.a: "Excellent!"
amcivwar.638.b: "Excellent!"

amcivwar.639.t: "The Minutemen Struggle!"
amcivwar.639.d: "The Minutemen are on their last legs as their militants are captured and interrogated in increasingly large numbers and we counter their atempted raids. With AFP propaganda being largely rooted out farmers or more clearly on our side of the conflict and they can do relatively little to disrupt us. Still their sting is felt and we must finish the job if we are to maximize our supplies and troop morale."
amcivwar.639.a: "Then let's finish them!"

amcivwar.640.t: "The Minutemen crushed!"
amcivwar.640.d: "The Minutemen are finished! With the AFP's militia collapsing and their men either retreating or facing reprisal from our men they are finished and our people can rest easy this force of hooligans will no longer terrorize them. Supplies can move with ease and soldiers have one less worry in their lives."
amcivwar.640.a: "Thank God!"

### Klan Resistance ###

amcivwar.641.t: "Klan Presence!"
amcivwar.641.d: "The NDWL and ODP aligned KKK are showing resistance to our regime an attempt to disrupt our government, attacking supply lines, disrupting factories and spreading counter-propaganda. We need to deal with this at once."
amcivwar.641.a: "Damn!"

amcivwar.642.t: "Klan Growth!"
amcivwar.642.d: "The Klan has seen increased growth, with their followers linking up more effectively with other white league groups. Attacks on our politicians and officers have grown more common as has bombs being planted in strategic locations and threats to kill those who cooperate with our government."
amcivwar.642.a: "Bastards!"

amcivwar.643.t: "Large Klan!"
amcivwar.643.d: "The NDWL miliaries, mainly the Klan, have gained a large foothold in our nation with many of our citizens being fearful of them and civilians being less willing to cooperate with us in response. Meanwhile our commanders are complaining of their disruptions to our military goods and assasination attempts on our men."
amcivwar.643.a: "Damn!"

amcivwar.644.t: "Massive Klan!"
amcivwar.644.d: "The KKK now has a simply massive presence in our population with virtually all civilians being aware and fearful of their presence and as a response withholding more aid from out government.

amcivwar.657.t: "Crime Grows"
amcivwar.657.d: "Not all Americans are either apathetic or deeply invested in one of the ideological factions fighting for victory as some opportunists have come onto the scene and gained serious power from the nation's weakness.

amcivwar.672.t: "Black Resistance Organized!"
amcivwar.672.d: "Black Resistance cells have put aside their common ideological differences relating to either economics or race nationalism versus civic nationalism and have come to simply agree that our government must be opposed.

##debug event##
amcivwar.1864.t: "Fate of the American Southwest"
amcivwar.1864.d: "For ease of access to our Arizona and Navajo content, we added this debug event to allow an easy way to get the new content. While the intended way to get Arizona and the Navajo Nation is to play as Mexico, do the Reconquista during the ACW, then trigger the Anglo Revolt and additionally the Navajo revolt against Arizona, doing so can take awhile and be up to some RNG. That being said, the experience will play the same either way, and nothing is adjusted to spawning early under different circumstances. IF YOU USE THIS EVENT TO SPAWN THE TAGS, STUFF CAN BREAK SO BE WARNED!"

amcivwar.1864.b: "Start the Navajo-Arizonian war, and play as the Navajo."
