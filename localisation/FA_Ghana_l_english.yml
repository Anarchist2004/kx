POLITICS_KWAME_NKRUMAH_DESC:0 "A titan of the Pan-African movement and a national father to the varied peoples of the Gold Coast, few Socialists in Africa are as prominent and respected as Kwame Nkrumah. Born in the small, rural village of Nkroful in 1909 into a poor and illiterate family, Nkrumah lived a peaceful and carefree childhood among the bush and along the pristine coast of what is now Ghana, being raised in the traditional Akan culture by his mother and large extended family. Influenced from a young age by the Christian faith, Nkrumah was educated at a Catholic mission in Half Assini as a boy, proving to be a sharp and dedicated pupil. Taken in by the German priest George Fischer, Nkrumah would be molded into a fiercely intelligent young man, graduating from his elementary studies two years early and becoming a student-teacher before even becoming an upper-classman. This aptitude for learning was not to be ignored by those around him however, and the deen of the Achimota School, one Reverend Alec Garden Fraser, soon took notice to the young intellectual, whisking Nkrumah away from the rural backwaters he had been learning in and sending him to the capital of Accra to further his studies in the finest university in the colony. \n\nWhile at this hallowed academic institution, Kwame Nkrumah struck up a close friendship with the deputy headmaster Kwegyir Aggrey, a noted missionary and intellectual known for dabbling in Pan-African ideals. It was here that Nkrumah would be exposed to the writings of W.E.B Du Bois, George Padmore, and Marcus Garvey, among many others, setting him on the path of Pan-Africanism. Still holding a great interest in religion however, the conflicted Nkrumah still occasionally dreamt of becoming a Jesuit missionary or a clergyman, but that would not be the case for long, as after one fateful brush-in with another titan of the Pan-African scene - Nigerian national father Nnamdi Azikiwe - Nkrumah’s worldview would never be the same. Witnessing this larger-than-life politician give an impassioned speech one day shortly before graduating on the struggles and righteousness of Black nationalism, Nkrumah’s decision was finally made and his inner conflict resolved. Faith would always be important to him, but Nkrumah knew at that moment that his true calling was to liberate his subjugated kin. \n\nWith these new ideals in mind, Nkrumah left for the United States at the turn of the decade, spending much of the early 1930’s attending different Black universities in New York and Philadelphia while further constructing his own strain of Pan-African ideology. With the cracks in Mittelafrika’s foundations becoming ever more apparent, Kwame Nkrumah returned home to the Gold Coast earlier than planned, emboldened by the new Pan-African and Socialist ideals picked up from his time abroad, and embedded himself immediately within the national political scene of the now former-colony. Preaching ideals of egalitarianism, educational reform, freedom of religion, and, above all, Pan-African Socialist Democracy, Nkrumah and his platform have become explosively popular across Ghana, earning his the position as the nation's first President. Now, only time will tell if Nkrumah will stay true to his preached noble ideals, or if he will take more direct action to ensure that the Pan-African dream is realized."
