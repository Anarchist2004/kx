kxott.1.t: "The Ottoman Empire Wishes for an Alliance"
kxott.1.d: "The Ottoman Empire, our old ally in the Weltkrieg, has proposed the resurrection of an alliance between us."
kxott.1.a: "Why wouldn't we?"
kxott.1.b: "Not today."

kxott.2.t: "The Ottomans wish for assistance"
kxott.2.d: "The Ottoman Empire, our old ally and now ally, has given us a request for equipment, including guns and artillery batteries. Do we give them the equipment, or do they not need it?"
kxott.2.a: "Yeah, send them some equipment."
kxott.2.b: "They don't need it."

kxott.3.t: "Assistance from Germany"
kxott.3.d: "Germany, in their endless kindness and benevolence, has bestowed upon us the equipment requested. At last! We will be better able to supply our armies."
kxott.3.a: "Hurrah!"

kxott.4.t: "No Assistance"
kxott.4.d: "Germany has refused our reasonable request for weaponry. We are allies, so we can't really do much except shake our tiny fist at them."
kxott.4.a: "Drat."

kxott.5.t: "Handing over the Suez Canal"
kxott.5.d: "With the German Military Mission firmly in control of the Ottoman Empire, the staff of the Mission have decided to transfer control of the vital Suez Canal to the Kasierreich. Publicly, this move is justified as a way to repay Germany for both helping us in the recent war with the Cairo Axis and also to pay off remaining debts from the Weltkrieg. Unofficially, the move is a clear attempt to sway those skeptical of the whole Ottoman ordeal back in Berlin."
kxott.5.a: "Quid Pro Quo..."

kxott.6.t: "The Ottoman Empire offers up the Suez!"
kxott.6.d: "With the recent success of the Ottoman Empire against the Cairo Axis with our aid, the Sultan's government has offered to transfer the Suez Canal to us. To the German public, the move makes little sense. While it is indeed greatly increasing our international standing, why they would hand over the most vital shipping port in the world over for free is unknown. To the upper echelons of the Kasierreich however, this makes perfect sense. With our Military Mission in neigh total power, it only makes sense for them to give us this most vital of shipping lanes. Afterall, without us, how can they hope to successfully carve out a German presence in the Middle-East? "
kxott.6.a: "A toast to our Ottoman friends!"

kxott.7.t: "Business with the Ottomans"
kxott.7.d: "The Ottoman Empire, a new ally for the Reichspakt, has been engaging in business ventures and trading with our Mittelafrikan colony. The business we exchange with each other has proven beneficial to the nation, with revenue going up and likewise our stability."
kxott.7.a: "Art of the deal!"

kxott.8.t: "Turkish Dissidents Located"
kxott.8.d: "The Turks who know too much, who know about the German shadow government, have been located. There isn't much time before they move again, so von Schellendorf has ordered an immediate squad to be sent out to deal with them, and by deal with them we mean kill them, and leave no traces. The world will forget about them."
kxott.8.a: "Deal with them, now!"

kxott.9.t: "Construction of the Damascus-Dar-es-Salaam railway"
kxott.9.d: "The Ottoman Empire, with funds from our business and trade, has sponsored construction and actually helped with construction on a giant railway leading for Damascus to Dar-es-Salaam. The railway has been completed now, and trains are moving back and forth along the lines already, to visit the great Ottoman city or rather the grand capital of Mittelafrika."
kxott.9.a: "Splendid!"

kxott.10.t: "unused"
kxott.10.d: "unused"
kxott.10.a: "unused"

kxott.11.t: "Wilhelm II Ascends the Throne"
kxott.11.d: "With the abdication of Sultan Abdulmecid II, Kaiser Wilhelm II has taken the throne. The coronation has taken place, and the new Ottoman Emperor is now Sultan Wilhelm II. Cheers from the coronation members erupted, and the Kaiser of Germany has only tightened the bond with the Ottoman Empire."
kxott.11.a: "Hail to thee in the victor's wreath!"

kxott.12.t: "Sultan Abdulmecid II forced to accept German overlordship"
kxott.12.d: "The people's sultan, Sultan Abdulmecid II, has signed an agreement facilitated by the German military mission that cedes all of his power to Germany, essentially turning the Ottoman into a German subject, but not entirely yet - it will take a little period of solidification in order to truly call the Empire a subject of the German Empire..."
kxott.12.a: "Now time for a new order..."

kxott.13.t: "The Ottomans at war!"
kxott.13.d: "Our old Weltkrieg ally, the Ottoman Empire, has been engulfed in the flames of war! We may receive them as an ally later as a result from aid, but then again, we are freely giving away equipment to them, and they may not even win."
kxott.13.a: "Send them aid."
kxott.13.b: "Oh well."

kxott.14.t: "Aid from Germany"
kxott.14.d: "Germany, in their endless kindness and benevolence, has bestowed upon us a satisfying shipment of armaments for the struggling Ottoman army. At last! We will be better able to supply our armies."
kxott.14.a: "Great!"

kxott.15.t: "Officers propose another military mission to the Ottomans"
kxott.15.d: "With the Ottoman Empire struggling in a war against Egypt and its Cairo Axis, the Ottoman Empire stands in danger. Its army is already seeing failure. Perhaps the first military mission wasn't enough, and a second military mission may be needed to sharpen the Ottoman soldiers..."
kxott.15.a: "Let's do it."
kxott.15.b: "Not again."

kxott.16.t: "Germany Offers Aid"
kxott.16.d: "The German Empire has offered our struggling Empire some aid! We will get some guns and artillery from the ordeal, and along with that some reassurance that we are not totally alone in this war. Thank you, Germany! However, this will increase German influence..."
kxott.16.a: "Our savior!"
kxott.16.b: "Never again!"

kxott.17.t: "German Officers Demand to Take Charge"
kxott.17.d: "The Second German Military Mission has seen success where they operate, and the Ottomans have seen failure in their operations. It is only reasonable, to the Germans at least, to demand full control over the Ottoman military. This will drastically increase German influence, but it may be what we need..."
kxott.17.a: "We'll see what they can do..."
kxott.17.b: "No! The Empire will persevere!"

kxott.18.t: "hidden"
kxott.18.d: "hidden"
kxott.18.a: "hidden"

kxott.19.t: "German Military Mission Grows More Powerful"
kxott.19.d: "The Military Mission has seen stalling and little progress on all fronts. It grows more powerful every day we fight this war. If we do not finish this war soon, Ottoman independence may in jeopardy..."
kxott.19.a: "We should tread carefully."

kxott.20.t: "The German Military Mission Fully Takes Over!"
kxott.20.d: "With the failure of the Ottoman military to deal with the threats at hand, Fritz Bronsart von Schellendorf has grown powerful enough in the Ottoman military to warrant a complete shadow takeover of the government. While the soldiers do not know about this transfer of leadership, and neither does the citizenry, a few members of the Ottoman government have fled and prepare to spread the word.\nAs for us, hopefully this sudden change in leadership will break the stalemate and lead to a great Ottoman victory..."
kxott.20.a: "Oh..."

kxott.21.t: "Kaiser Wilhelm III Takes the Throne"
kxott.21.d: "With the death of Kaiser Wilhelm II, Kaiser Wilhelm III has taken the throne. The coronation has taken place, and the new Ottoman Emperor is now Sultan Wilhelm III. Cheers from the coronation members erupted, and the Kaiser of Germany has only tightened the bond with the Ottoman Empire."
kxott.21.a: "Hail to thee in the victor's wreath!"
