### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_JAMES_CURLEY_DESC:0 "A disaster mitigated by moments of farce or a Northern Huey Long, depending on who you ask. James Michael Curley, Governor of Massachusetts is corrupt as the day is long. Curley served four terms as the Mayor of Boston (one of them while in prison) and was under constant investigation by the Boston Finance Commission. It didn't keep him from being elected governor in 1935. Probably because while he was lining his own pockets, he was also building schools, libraries, parks, roads, and enlarging Boston City Hospital. An Irishman, a Democrat, and a popular Governor, Curley wields significant influence in New England."

POLITICS_AMANULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "After the murder of his father by a dominionist assassin, Amanullah has been filled with a deep-seated hatred for the British. For too long has mighty Afghanistan been forced to hide in the shade of the British Raj. For too long has the King of the God-granted Kingdom of Afghanistan and its dependencies been regarded as the leader of a second-rate power. Only through blood and steel shall the Afghan people carve their place in the Sun from the corpse of the British Empire, just as the Germans did."
POLITICS_HABIBULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Habibullah's reign has thus far been marked by reforms and attempts to modernize his country by working to bring modern medicine and other technology to Afghanistan. In 1903, Habibullah founded the Habibia school as well as a military academy. He also worked to put in place progressive reforms in his country. He instituted various legal reforms and repealed many of the harshest criminal penalties. Though at first strictly maintaining the country's neutrality in World War I, he would eventually cave after strenuous efforts by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and a German military mission (the Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition) to enlist Afghanistan on its side. His declaration of the 4th Anglo-Afghan War would see an influx of supplies from the German Empire and relations between the two nations have remained positive since."
POLITICS_KALAKANI_DESC:0 "Amir Habibullah was born in 1891 in the village of Kalakan, north of Kabul. An ethnic Tajik, his father was named Aminullah and delivered water to people's homes. During his adolescence, Kalakani ventured out of his village and traveled to the city of Kabul. In the south, he met an old Sufi who told the young Habibullah that he would become king one day. Later, he returned to Kabul and joined Amanullah Khan's army. Kalakani would be a highwayman who mostly stole from the wealthy for some time. Only a few months after the disastrous 5th Anglo-Afghan War, Kalakani and his friends began to attack the unprotected Kabul from the north. The revolt caught steam and the country was thrown into a civil war. Wild tribesmen from Waziristan had the southern areas of Kabul surrounded, and Kalakāni's forces moved into the heart of Kabul from the north, taking the capital. He finally had become King."

POLITICS_WARROOM_DESC:0 ""Gentlemen! You can't fight in here, this is the war room!"\n\nWith the collapse of D.C., a council of generals had to be hastily assembled in order to maintain some semblance of order within the military. However, with constant conflicting directions and a bloated bureaucracy, the military and governance are disorganized and remain ineffecient."

POLITICS_EARL_KEMP_DESC:0 "Earl Kemp Long, born in 1895, is the younger brother of the late rebel leader Huey Long. Continuing in his brother's footsteps, Earl is a progressive reformer who campaigned in dixie on a ticket of expanded school lunches, public works, and minoritiy rights. Many devotee's of Huey's brother herald him as a true heir that will finish what his brother started. Others however say that Longisim is what lost the the war against the Federals to begin with. Either way, Earl Kemp Long's political future will continue to be defined by the legacy of Huey, unless he can forge his name as a polical force in its own right."
POLITICS_FRANCIS_BLAIR_LEE_III_DESC:0 "Francis Preston Blair Lee III, born in 1916, was a member of the Lee family, a major historical political family in American history. His father was a major force in Maryland politics, and he is a direct desendant of a founder of the Declaration of Independence. Lee made a name for himself during the Third American Revolution, fighting bravely against the Syndicalists in battles along the Kentucky and Tennessee borders. His administration promises to be somewhat-progressive, but to also fight for 'Dixie Values and Dixie People.' Lee is keeping his family tradition alive."

POLITICS_LOVECRAFT_DESC:0 "H.P. Lovecraft, born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890, is perhaps one of the most mysterious and controversial figures of the 20th century. His father dying when he was 8, his mother dying of the Spanish Flu in late 1918, and Lovecraft suffering from a plethora of health issues his entire life have led Lovecraft into a search for truth and deep meaning, which he channeled into his writings. Tales of darkness and horror within resonated strongly with an America reeling from the 1925 market crash. Lovecraft's science fiction gained him a serious audience for his thoughts on politics and philosophy. He rapidly gained an almost cult-like status in his home state of Rhode Island and drew many followers, preaching a dark and otherworldly message about supernatural powers and eldritch beings that are incomprehensible to the human mind. As president of the New England Literary Society, Lovecraft standardized the use of the English language in print, removing what he called 'Americanisms'. When he traveled to England in 1924 to study the English language and attempt to purify it as much as possible, he witnessed the 1925 uprising and grew an acute hatred of Syndicalism. He returned to America in 1930, founded his own newspaper and ran unsuccessfully for governor of Rhode Island. He remained a prominent thought leader and a powerful influence on the minds of New Englanders, although his opponents accuse Lovecraft of being a dangerous man with authoritarian and occultist inclinations."
POLITICS_BAXTER_DESC:0 "Baxter was born into a wealthy family in Portland, Maine where his father James Phinney Baxter served six terms as mayor and had made his fortune in the canning industry. He earned a law degree from Harvard University in 1901. He was a freind to the Canadian government, and a popular governer of Maine, when King Edward VIII decided to put him in charge of the newly created New England Protectorate. He is to protect its people and ensure their loyalty to the crown."

POLITICS_WILD_BILL_DESC:0 "William Joseph 'Wild Bill' Donovan was born in Buffalo, New York, and studied law at Columbia university. He served under General Pershing in the Mexican campaign and then under General MacArthur as a Colonel in the 42nd division.  During the 2nd American Civil War, Donovan remained loyal to America and fought with distinction against both the Syndicalists and the Longists in their final battles. During the war, Donovan was appointed by MacArthur to America's quasi inteligence service the Black Chamber, who's code breaking resulted in the capture of several important rebel figures. Now, ever loyal Donovan leads the last remnants of America's leadership in their Washington stronghold. God bless the Enclave. God bless America."
POLITICS_MACARTHUR_IV_DESC:0 "Arthur MacArthur IV, born February 21, 1938, is the only child of Douglas MacArthur and is the rightful heir to our great Caesar. While the boy is obviously too young to properly rule, he has been given the official title as head of state by Loyalists who wish to continue MacArthur's line. As the son of the Great American Unifier, there are high expectations for the young MacArthur. Whether they will be fulfilled remains to be seen."

POLITICS_FORD_DESC:0 "Henry Ford was born July 30, 1863, on a farm in Greenfield Township, Michigan. An entrepreneur and a business man, his Ford Motor Company was highly successful, bringing the automobile into most people's lives for the first time. By 1936, Ford had built such a power base that the syndicalist uprising failed to kill him or significantly damage his business, and much of Ford's equipment would help General MacArthur. After the American Collapse, Ford and his company seized power over the Great Lakes, where his powerbase was concentrated. Now, Henry Ford is the absolute ruler of a great portion of America, and his company has complete ownership of the old Syndicalist heartland."

POLITICS_CHARLES_CURTIS_DESC:0 "The Vice President of the Hoover administration, Curtis is the voice of compromise and reform in the American government. The first President of Native American ancestry, he serves as an effective rallying point for racial justice and brings an affable face and new commitment to American values of liberty and freedom for all men, although many wonder if he can settle the coming conflict."
POLITICS_BIG_BILL_HAYWOOD_DESC:0 "If there ever was a man to represent the power of the working class, it would be William Haywood. Haywood has seen all corners of the country and lived alongside the working man. Haywood opposed Craft Unionism, which he felt could be divided and conquered by Capital. Instead founding one union, the International Workers of the World, meant to represent all working interests.  As the founder of the IWW, 'Big Bill' has battled the enemies of the people throughout his life: The capitalist opportunists, the labor slavehandlers, and even agents of the government. Quick to anger and unafraid of action, Haywood is the Man for Labor and the Man for America."

POLITICS_INNSMOUTH_DESC:0 "Charles Dern is a progressive businessman and the former head of the America First Party in Utah. Born in 1872 in Nebraska, Dern settled in Utah to found a successful ironworks company. After becoming disillusioned with the Democratic Party, Dern took inspiration from the reformist policies of Louisiana's Huey Long, eventually joining the America First Party. Dern ran unsuccessfully on a progressive platform for governor and broke all ties with the AFP after the American Union State rose into full rebellion. During the Civil War, Dern supported the legitimate government, and after the Collapse ran on a platform of peace and welfare. Tired and war-weary, the people of Utah have voted in Dern to implement his progressive reforms and lead Utah down a kinder, gentler road."
POLITICS_THEREWILLBEBLOOD_DESC:0 "Henry Hooper Blood was born October 1st 1872, in Kaysville, Utah Territory. A prominent businessman, he successfully ran for governor of the state of Utah in 1933. A key civilian figure within the MacArthur regime, Blood has managed to bring his state beyond the quasi-independent status it enjoyed before 1857. Only time will tell whether this fledgling nation's independence will be more secure than the last."
POLITICS_EZRABENSON_DESC:0 "Benson was born into a Mormon family in 1899 on a farm in Whitney, Idaho, and would be called to become a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles in 1939. After getting special permission, he was allowed to serve as both an a apostle and a member of the cabinet, where he served as Secretary of Agriculture for the wartime administration. During his tenure he was fiercely in opposition to redistributionism and government aid, viewing it as immoral theft. After the Great American Collapse, he promised the people of Deseret a nonintrusive, minimalist government. The war-weary populace readily agreed and elected him. Now Benson's vison of maximum liberty will play out across the nation of Deseret, perhaps for a long time to come."
POLITICS_ROMNEY_DESC:0 "George W Romney, born 1907 in the Mormon Colonies in Mexico, is a successful Mormon businessman and an anti-syndicalist political pundit. Having witnessed Syndicalist revolutions in both Britain and Mexico, where Romney had been a missionary, Romney developed a great aversion to Syndicalist ideology. During the 2nd American Civil War, Romney served as Acting Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for the federal government, and had traveled the Federal controlled territories speaking about the dangers of Syndicalism and stirring up support for the war. Now he has been appointed to the leadership of an independent Deseret, and his anti-syndicalist vision will safely guide them into the future."
POLITICS_HEBER_DESC:0 "Heber Grant, born 1865 in Salt Lake City, Utah, is the president of the Church of Latter Day Saints, commonly known as the Mormon Church. An apostle, Grant was called in 1918, after the death of Joseph F. Smith, to serve as the leader of the Mormon Church. As leader, he led an agenda of strict Prohibition, banned plural marriages, and reconciled relations with the US Government. During the 2nd American Civil War, he urged Mormons to support the Federal government, seeing it as the best hope for a orderly and moral society in America. After the Great American Collapse, the LDS Church, with Grant at its head, has taken the reigns and re-established the nation of Deseret as an independent Mormon nation. Once again the Mormons rely on their faith in God to lead them towards a better tomorrow."
POLITICS_REUBENCLARK_DESC:0 "J. Reuben Clark was born in Grantsville, Utah Territory, on September 1st 1871. First a employee of the State Department, and then returning to Utah to serve as Second Counselor to the First President. In October 1934, Clark was ordained an apostle and member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. During the ACW he proposed several reforms which centralized and expanded the Church Of Latter Day Saints' business operations. After the Great American Collapse, Clark and Grant would lead opposing factions within the Church. After a long and tumultuous powerstruggle, Clark secured his power and led the Church in taking over the state of Deseret and restoring order. Now his hand will guide it to the future."
