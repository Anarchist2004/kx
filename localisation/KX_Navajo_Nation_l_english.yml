##Events##
nvn.1.t:0 "Diné Bahaneʼ"
nvn.1.d:0 "’Diné Bahaneʼ’, or the Story of the People, is the general name for the Navajo creation myth that began with the Holy Wind and the Four Holy People and the Four Worlds at the Beginning, but it has also become a term used for the story of our new free and independent Navajo Nation - the modern creation myth of our once-again free people. Centuries ago, the Europeans came, and all know the tale of how they brought ruin and ‘modernity’ to this once unsullied continent. They forced the Navajo peoples and many other tribes from the East towards the West, eventually forcing us and others like us onto the reservations that exist all over North America to this day in what the Navajo call the Long Walk. Reaching its pinnacle when the Americans tried to ethnically cleanse and genocide our people in 1864, the Navajo and our related peoples of the Southwest such as the Apache, Hopi, Pima, and many more have been on the slow decline ever since, withering away under American occupation as we have tried to keep one foot in tradition and one on the road to progress and hopeful salvation. \n\nSeeing a shot at freedom once and for all when the Anglos rebelled against their new Mexican occupiers, many of our people followed Chee Dodge’s decision to aid Goldwater in his revolt, for the Tribal Chairman of the Navajo believed that working with Goldwater and winning the Anglo Revolt would finally bring equality, freedom, and relief to our long-suffering people. However, Chee Dodge was sorely wrong. With many of our people split on the decision, our own tribes suffered their own civil conflicts as families and tribes were split between those that fought on the side of the Americans and those that supported the Mexicans. Though the revolt was finally won, the scar it has left on our peoples is clearly visible, and the issues do not stop there. \n\nWith the Arizonans decision to deny us our mineral and water rights, once again breaking treaties and promises as the Americans have been so prone to do, we have been forced into war once again, but now cautiously united aiming at a shot at true independence. Away from the frontlines, Chee Dodge - once running unopposed in recent elections for leading the Navajo Nation and our new unity fire council of the various Southwestern Tribes - has now found a political rival in the young officer Ira Hayes, who has proven himself a sound, humane leader and tactical genius in both our war against the Mexicans and now in our war against the Arizonans. With our nation fighting for survival once again, with the rigors of trying to establish an independent state stacking on the strain, and with political challenges at home, our newly sovereign Navajo Nation teeters on the edge of collapse as we stand at the crossroads of destiny. Let us hope we can find a sound way through to paradise."
nvn.1.a:0 "Be still, and the Earth will speak to you."

nvn.2.t:0 "A New Naach’id"
nvn.2.d:0 "The Naach’id is a rarely-convened council of elders, political and spiritual leaders, and other important members of the main Navajo familial clans, tribes, and bands that is used to discuss and decide upon extremely important matters that affect the whole nation. Not convened in decades, this new Naach’id is special, for it has included the tribal elders and leaders of our fellow tribes in the Southwestern Unity Pact, including chiefs, chairmen, and presidents from the Ute, the Apache, the Hopi, the Pueblo, the Pima, the Zuni, and the other local tribes of the Four Corners region, causing quite the controversy among the more traditional members of the Navajo. Even more controversial has been the decision to allow the surviving leaders of the Arizonans also be in attendance, for their fates shall be decided here as well, though they will have no say, and should any even speak, they will be thrown out of the proceedings. The Naach’id has been called mainly to discuss the future of our newly independent Navajo Nation, with this group chiefly desiring to discuss just how ‘Navajo’ the new Nation shall be. Though the Navajo, led by Tribal Chairman and former chief Chee Dodge, dominate this new state in terms of population and political influence, the other half of this coalition, though varied and factionalist, still holds great sway, especially since our war for independence could not have been won without them and their leader Ira Hayes. Though normal elections for the leader of the Navajo Nation usually never require the Naach’id being convened, the extraneous circumstances of this new reality have called for its use, and now the choice is up to this council of esteemed elders on who shall lead our newly free Amerindian nation?"
nvn.2.a:0 "Go with the tribal unity group of war hero Ira Hayes."
nvn.2.b:0 "Side with Navajo interests and Chee Dodge."

nvn.3.t:0 "The Second Order of Business for the Naach’id"
nvn.3.d:0 "With the leadership debate out of the way, the second main topic in discussion within the Naach’id is to be the fate of the Arizonans. Our group has largely been split into three factions over what should be the fate of the Anglos. The dominant opinion is to have the leaders of the revolt, including the infamous ‘Man of Gold and Water’, executed while the bulk of their populace will be allowed to peacefully integrate into our society. This option would leave some resentment in their mouths, but limit their ability to retaliate and offer them a gateway to becoming an equal citizen in our state, which would likely be best over the long term. Alternatively, the two other factions within the Naach’id argue over either pardoning their leaders fully and while working towards integration, which would cause the least amount of unrest among their numbers but also leave their leaders free to spread rhetoric against us, and the drastic alternative. This alternative would see the Anglo leaders hanged and the reservation system revived but reversed, forcing the massive population of Arizonans into large reservations on barren land with powerless autonomy, living as we once did under their regime. The least human option, it would cause unrest but at least ensure the Arizonanas do not have the supplies necessary to rise in violence ever again. What should we do?"
nvn.3.a:0 "Pardon their leaders and work towards peaceful integration."
nvn.3.b:0 "Hang their leaders, and integrate them as peacefully as possible."
nvn.3.c:0 "Reverse the long-standing reservation system, giving them powerless autonomy."
