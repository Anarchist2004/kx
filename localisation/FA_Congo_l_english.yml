All around us lie neighboring regions ripe for the taking, and so we must begin to prepare for war once more so that we may bring these lush regions into the fold.

Though it is expensive, we have no alternative, and as long as our plunder piles remain stocked and these men paid, our state should run just fine.

COG_lack_of_resources_desc:0 "With the UMHK’s decision to break off from the Vrijstaat, they have cut off their mines and factories to the wider Congo until this crisis has been resolved. Normally, one company closing its doors would not be too big an issue, but when a company that owns 70% of the national economy does it, it can cause some issues. Until we reclaim the lands of Haut Katanga, our state’s finances shall struggle, for without the Union Miniére, the Congo’s economy is nothing."

War maims, it burns, it destroys the very civilization we are trying to build and preserve, and this latest war was no different. The Congo now lay in a state of total disrepair, and our fragile nation is once more fractured and burning.

congo_news.1.t:0 "Colonial Rule Holds On in the Congo"
congo_news.1.d:0 "The violence and chaos of the Congo Civil War has finally abated, and despite all odds, the incumbent Flandro-Wallonian colonial regime has somehow survived it all and come out on top. Under Governor-General [KTG.getleader], the Vrijstaat has defeated mercenaries, rogue paramilitaries, and the burning will for independence of the Congolese themselves - all turned to ash under the might of the Force Publique.\n\n It seems no matter the turmoil or effort, the Congo simply cannot shake their European overlords."
congo_news.1.a:0 "The more things change, the more they stay the same."

congo_news.2.t:0 "Leopoldville Restores Order to the Congo"
congo_news.2.d:0 "The valiant soldiers of the Force Publique stationed in the gleaming capital city that is Leopoldville have managed to restore order outside of their shimmering metropolis and across the wider Congo’s countryside, forcing out the bickering factions that have long resisted their rule.\n\n Now, the world sits on the edge of their seat to see if these ‘peacekeepers’ shall tow the line, or take the Congo in a more radical direction to ensure stability.."
congo_news.2.a:0 "Blessed are the peacemakers."

congo_news.3.t:0 "Congo United by the Faithful"
congo_news.3.d:0 "Though the Congo Crisis has seen the rise and fall of a vast myriad of factions, none could have predicted that the Nzungists, or Kimbanguists, would be the victors. Led by the Prophet, or Ngunza, Simon Kimbangu, this Baptist-influenced Afrianized Chrsitian sect has captivated the globe with recent reports that this holy man and his forces managed to conquer the warring factions of the Congo with both pen and sword, and now pushes to create a true and peaceful Eden at the heart of Africa. Whether this ‘manifestation’ of the Holy Spirit will actually achieve that however is anyone’s guess.."
congo_news.3.a:0 "Their eyes have seen the glory of the Lord and his Prophet."

congo_news.4.t:0 "Rogue Capitalists Seize the Congo"
congo_news.4.d:0 "The violence and chaos of the Congo Civil War have officially and finally come to an end today with the reports of a final ceasefire finally being negotiated in Leopoldville. The most recent reports coming in from that primordial expanse seem to point to the idea that the victors were not the nascent colonial regime nor the natives, but the monopolistic capitalists of the Flandro-Wallonian controlled mining conglomerate known as the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga, or the UMHK. This massive entity is now the single largest company in Africa, and now has the world’s attention as it must balance their pursuit of profit with the undertakings of running a state."
congo_news.4.a:0 "For the global economy’s sake, let us hope this venture doesn’t fold."

congo_news.5.t:0 "The Yeke Kingdom Rises Once More"
congo_news.5.d:0 "News from the Congo has trickled in and has depicted quite a peculiar tale as reports detail the rise of a group once thought fully exterminated - the forces of the Mwami. It seems that the constant defeats dealt by the hands of the Ryckmans regime earlier in the decade did not deal as large a blow to the Mwami’s power as once thought, and he and his forces have seemingly rebounded, surging forth from their jungle hiding spots and claiming victory in the Congo Civil War. Securing their base of power in their homelands in the southern region of Katanga, the oppressed Garanganze natives have allied with the wider Congolese native population and risen up throw out the Colonials, and now the world stands in awe as the once-extinct Yeke Kingdom rises from the pages of history."
congo_news.5.a:0 "The heirs of Msiri return to their throne."

congo_news.6.t:0 "The Congolese Earn the Right to Self-Rule"
congo_news.6.d:0 "The maelstrom that was the Congo Civil War has finally ended and it appears a new age has dawned in the Congo. Rebelling against the colonial government and fending off both rogue capitalists and violence-addicted mercenaries, the native Askari troops and democratic elements banded around the Young General Gonzague in the eastern region of Kivu have succeeded in their struggle for independence. Through blood, sweat, and sacrifice, the native Congolese have earned the right to determine their own fate, and have become one of the first fully independent and ‘stabilized’ nations in Post-Collapse Africa. Now the world waits to see if the Congolese can handle the burdens of modern nationhood."
congo_news.6.a:0 "A light of hope glimmering from the dark heart of Africa, perhaps?"

congo_news.7.t:0 "Mercenaries Take the Congo!"
congo_news.7.d:0 "A notable development has occurred within the jungles of the Congo, for it appears the Mercenaries du Congo-Ouest have beaten back the various warring factions of the horrific Congo Crisis and now control the entirety of the Congo, in theory. In reality, according to insider reports, the Congo has been reduced to a disconnected fiefdom of warring mercenary factions all vying for control of this primordial expanse. What lies in store now for the Congo, and whether these soldiers can truly tame these wilds, remains to be seen, but the world shall watch with great interest as these soldiers and cutthroats attempt to rebuild a functioning society."
