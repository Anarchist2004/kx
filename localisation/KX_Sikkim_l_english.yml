#Leader Descriptions#

POLITICS_TASHI_NAMGYAL_DESC:0 "Crowned by the Dalai Lama in 1914 after the death of his half-brother, His Highness Sri Panch Maharaja Tashi Namgyal, Maharaja Chogyal of Sikkim, is the undisputed sovereign of the Kingdom of Sikkim. Born in Tibet in 1893, Tashi is only the most recent ruler in a dynastic line that has lasted since 1642. Nominally an absolute monarch, Tashi has infamously begun a crusade to reform and liberalize Sikkimese society, but this has come into conflict with the desires of the conservative nobility. Though he receives tacit support from more radical elements, many fear that the king may not be able to go far enough to truly modernize the archaic state of Sikkim, and so the 11th Chogyal walks a razor's edge here at the top of the world as he seeks to bring prosperity to this paradise amid the mountains."
POLITICS_JERMAN_LEPCHA_DESC:0 "Standing as the face of the radical reformist movement called the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha, Jerman Lepcha is the unity figure that binds the various reformist, liberal, and vaguely Socialist groups that seek a modern and prosperous Sikkim free of the nobility and the monarchy. Born in 1910, this young firebrand has waged a mostly peaceful, non-cooperative protest campaign against the deep-rooted and oppressive aristocracy, and now stands as the progressive savior of Sikkimese democracy. Seeking to bring agrarian-minded, Socialist-inspired total societal reform to this archaic land, Sikkim shall never be the same as Jerman guides it and his people towards a uniquely-Sikkimese modernity."

#Ideas#
SKM_ethnic_tensions:0 "The Chaotic Melting Pot of the Himalayas"
SKM_ethnic_tensions_desc:0 "Despite our tiny size, Sikkim is a land of diversity and ethno-religious friction. Between Hindus and Buddhists, our people cannot agree on matters of spirituality, and with bickering ethnic groups always chomping at the bit, our nation suffers from societal schisms. From the dominant Lepchas that control the monarchy and the South, to Limbus and Magars along with Tibetic speakers of the North, to the masses of Indians hailing from various ethno-linguistic groups, and even with the stray souls from China and Bhutan, our nation is at the crossroads of cultures, languages, religions, and empires, and this has turned us into the little melting pot of the Himalayas, for better or for worse. Regardless, these schisms must be mended if our Kingdom is to survive the relentless dawn of modernity."
SKM_archaic_economy:0 "An Archaic and Feudalistic Reality"
SKM_archaic_economy_desc:0 "It is no secret that Sikkim is not an economic superpower. Sikkim isn’t even a regional or local power, and this harsh reality blatantly and painfully shows across the nation. Much of our people live their lives as poor peasants, working fields and paying tithes to the nobility in a feudal system that has existed for centuries. If Sikkim is ever to reach modernity and prosperity, drastic changes must come to our ‘Secret Land of Rice’ among the Himalayas."
SKM_landowning_elite:0 "Dominance of the Nobility"
SKM_landowning_elite_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Sikkim has been under the thumb of the nobility for centuries, and atop this hierarchy is the Namgyal Dynasty and the largest and most dominant aristocratic clan - the Kazis. From forcing peasants to parade them around in palanquins to working their serfs to the bone in the fields, these blue-bloods rule with an iron fist gilded in gold, and with one hand in the national coffers at all times. However, the current Chogyal is noted for his desire to reform this reality, and from within the shadows, relatively peaceful Socialist revolutionaries clamor for their time to strike, egged on by foreign backers and united by the infamous Jerman Lepcha. The nobility may be dominant, but they walk a delicate tight-rope, and if they are not careful, these aristocrats may finally be pushed from their lofty position."
SKM_chogyal:0 "The 11th Chogyal, Maharaja of Sikkim"
SKM_chogyal_desc:0 "His Highness Sri Panch Maharaja Tashi Namgyal, Maharaja Chogyal of Sikkim, or Bkra-shis Rnam-rgyal, is the 11th Chogyal, or king, and current Maharaja of our paradise, ruling over both the Buddhist and Hindu populations as the one true ruler of the Kingdom of Sikkim. Succeeding his half-brother who died of heart failure in 1914 after only reigning for eleven months, Tashi has stood as the most powerful man in Sikkim for decades. Despite pushback from the nobility - and especially from the Kazis - Tashi is a reformer at heart. His dream for Sikkim is to create a fair and free parliamentary monarchy with himself at the helm, supported by a democratically elected council to aid him in matters of statecraft and beyond. However, this dream is far easier said than done, and the 11th Chogyal will have to be careful, for the scavenging leopards have already begun to circle the reformer king’s throne."

sikkim.1.t:0 "The New Year Dawns on Paradise"
sikkim.1.d:0 "Literally called paradise - Nye-mae-el - by the Lepcha, the dominant ethnic group of the nation, Sikkim is a beautiful and storied mountain refuge safe from the wider world, or at least, it was once isolated. Now, Sikkim has been held hostage in a diplomatic game of tug-of-war, for Sikkim sits at the crossroads of empires on this sliver of the mighty Himalayas. \n\nSikkim has been a monarchy since 1642, dominated by the Namgyal dynasty for over 300 years despite the rise of numerous other empires including the colonial behemoth of the British. A Buddhist family tied to the Lamas ruling over a multi-ethnic and multi-religious state is no easy task, but the Namgyals have managed to keep the Kingdom of Sikkim together for centuries. However, this legacy is now being tested more than ever. \n\nWhen the Raj fell in the wake of the British Revolution, Sikkim was one of hundreds of states to break free from the dying carcass of British Imperialism, but Sikkim now stands nearly alone as a post-Raj state free from the main Indian factions. This independence was not widely wanted outside our borders however, for Nepal, Bhutan, and what has now become the Bharatiya Commune have all tried to absorb our mountain kingdom. Their efforts have all been kept at bay due to the nation’s close ties with and guarantees of national sovereignty by Tibet, for the Lamas of Tibetan Buddhism and the royal family, as well as much of the nobility, have been closely linked for as long as the kingdom has existed. A nominal subject of the Qing, Tibet has been able to defend Sikkim’s independence, but with the wavering Manchu dynasty close to collapse, Tibet is no longer in any position to be able to waste troops guarding foreign borders. \n\nAs the Qing inch closer to collapse, the wolves that circle our kingdom only grow more bold, and soon our independence will surely be tested unless we do something first. It is up to the 11th Chogyal - or king - and Maharaja of Sikkim, His Highness Tashi Namgyal, to guide the nation through the fires of foreign diplomacy while dealing with the rising tides of radicalism and greater calls for reforms. Seeking to liberalize and modernize the nation despite pushback from powerful aristocratic families like the Kazi, Chogyal Tashi must strike a balance and mend the schisms that divide Sikkim lest this paradise come to a burning end under the boots of foreign powers."
sikkim.1.a:0 "Sikkim, Kham-sum-wangdu!"

sikkim.2.t:0 "Tashi’s Gambit for the Reformation of Sikkim"
sikkim.2.d:0 "Chogyal Tashi has long desired to reform Sikkimese society in a major way, pushing for sweeping reforms to the educational system, the healthcare system, the judiciary, the nobility, the economy, and more, virtually rebuilding all of Sikkimese society from the ground up. These reforms would slowly see Sikkim transformed into a mixed-economy populist monarchy supported by a modernized, primarily agrarian industry, greatly expanded social and civil rights, and most groundbreaking of all - the end of the neo-feudal system dominated by the nobility through sweeping land reform and the creation of a true, democratically elected Sikkimese parliament. Modeled on the Indian Congress as well as from both the British and German systems, Tashi seeks to create a syncretic ideology formfit for Sikkim’s unique reality with the wellbeing of the masses as the key concern, earning him the nickname the People’s Chogyal. \n\nHowever, this reformation has one large and near-immovable obstacle - the nobility. Traditionalist, conservative, and resistant to change in most forms, these influential and affluent aristocrats may be subservient to the crown, but there is no secret they truly run Sikkim. If Tashi is to be able to push his desired reforms, he will have to break with most of them, losing him much support that would hopefully be replaced by the democratic and supportive voices of the masses, or he will be forced to heavily compromise his vision. Supporting Tashi, at least for now, is Jerman Lepcha and his band of radical liberal reformers in the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha - a band of peaceful reform-minded protestors pushing for the democratization and liberalization of Sikkimese society. However, though they are peaceful now, Jerman has sworn that should Tashi break his promises for effective reform, he and his growing band of followers will have no other choice than to take matters into their own hands. \n\nWith all this in mind, and with over two decades of ruling experience and preparation already behind him, it is finally time for the 11th Chogyal to decide the ultimate fate of his paradisiacal kingdom."
sikkim.2.a:0 "I am Chogyal, and what I say goes! The final reforms shall be begun!"
sikkim.2.b:0 "We must heed the word of the nobles. It’s not like the serfs will actually revolt."

sikkim.3.t:0 "The Peasant Coup"
sikkim.3.d:0 "With Chogyal Tashi bending to the whims of the spoiled nobility, Jerman and his SKM have decided to drop their pacifistic opposition, taking up arms across the nation in a hastily organized but well-prepared revolution. Using the mountainous terrain and lack of infrastructure or good communications to their advantage, the rebels have already seized the capital after slaughtering the Sikkim Guard garrisoning the royal palace. Though they took ten times the losses themselves, the peasantry have numbers on their side, and it would seem that all hope for the monarchy and the nobility it lost. Jerman Lepcha was true to his word, and with Tashi’s refusal to go through with his reforms, the Tigerslayer himself has risen to lead a new Socialist-inspired but largely non-radical republican government. The centuries-old reign of the Namgyal dynasty is finally at an end as the Sikkimese Revolution comes to a hasty end."

sikkim.9.d:0 "We have received a message from an envoy sent out by Tashi Namgyal, King of Sikkim, requesting aid and support in his endeavours in return for closer ties between our nations. Considering how this envoy must have trekked across the Himalayas with some of the most treacherous conditions present just to make deliver this message, some of our supporters believe Sikkim to be in true danger, and we must provide aid immediately. Others are still not convinced and see no reason to waste precious time and resource into such an irrelevant speck of land. What response shall we send the envoy back with?"
sikkim.9.a:0 "Namgyal shall have our full support!"
sikkim.9.b:0 "Begone, we have no need for Sikkim."

sikkim.10.t:0 "Sikkim Calls for Aid"
sikkim.10.d:0 "In a matter of strange circumstances, a diplomat under the orders of the King of Sikkim, Tashi Namgyal, has arrived in Delhi, expressing that the micronation that was once under our rule seeks out our aid against the Socialists creeping up upon them. This could be a good opportunity for us to limit the Red’s influence in the Himalayas further – if they were to conquer Sikkim, then Nepal would surely come next, and that is a risk that we cannot ignore. However, there is still much to do back in the Homefront, and Sikkim is certainly not going to be providing us with much of anything. How shall we respond?"
sikkim.10.a:0 "We can always spare a little help."
sikkim.10.b:0 "We are far too busy to send aid. Best of luck!"

sikkim.11.t:0 "Sikkim Calls for Aid"
sikkim.11.d:0 "One of the main goals of the Commune of France is to foster Syndicalism worldwide, to one degree or another, and often we get many diplomats, generals, and exiled politicians seeking financial and military support from us. However, today’s ‘guest’ is not an envoy, diplomat, or any person for that matter – it is in fact a letter from the faraway land of Sikkim, of whom wish aid in the form of supplies directly from us, to help foster their socialist cause. Many members of the foreign office, understandably, are hesitant. There is little to no news of this land, or the state of its people. Some in our government cannot even point to where it might be on the global map. For all we know, this can be all an elaborate hoax. However, we cannot allow a Socialist nation’s cry for help to go unheeded, out of our sheer principles. What is to be done?"
sikkim.11.a:0 "Very well, let’s hope this is not some reactionary plot to waste our time."
sikkim.11.b:0 "As if we would ever believe in a country called ‘Sikkim’!"

sikkim.12.t:0 "Sikkim Calls for Aid"
sikkim.12.d:0 "Once again, we have received a request from our tiny ally to the north requesting more aid in order to build its industry and military. For such a small nation, their request is easily doable. Let us just hope they put it to good use, one way or another."
sikkim.12.a:0 "Anything for our Revolution!"

sikkim.13.t:0 "the Ghorkas rise up!"
sikkim.13.d:0 "Instigated by our foe to the north in the form of Sikkim of all places, Nepali Ghorkas in Darjeeling have begun to rebel against our rule en masse, rising up against us in order to bend the knee to the Kingdom of Sikkim! How this came about, we have no idea, but it is vital that we respond to this blatant act of war immediately!"
sikkim.13.a:0 "Let them go, they’re not worth the fight."
sikkim.13.b:0 "To war!"

sikkim.14.t:0 "At the Top of the World"
sikkim.14.d:0 "Against all odds, we have finally come out on top as the sole ruler of the Himalayas. With the Nepalese under our heel and the foolish Dragon King of Bhutan humbled, we have shown the world the true might that is Sikkim. However, none of this would have been possible without the guidance and wisdom of our beloved King of the Himalayas, Tashi Namgyal. His vision for Sikkim does not end here however – now, he seeks to integrate the new lands under our flag as one nation, defined by the true faith of Buddhism. As his people rejoice, his subjugated subjects watch in horror. Only time will tell how this new powerhouse of Asia shall fare." 
sikkim.14.a:0 "We will be the true King of the Mountains!"

sikkim.15.t:0 "Uniting the Mountains"
sikkim.15.d:0 "After a long struggle, we have achieved the impossible; centuries of despotic rule have finally ended in the Himalayas as Jerman Lepcha addresses the hundreds of onlookers attend his celebratory ceremony in the centre of Gangtok. While the journey has been arduous for our people, with help from the Bharatiya Commune and sheer perseverance, we have emerged victorious. The peasantry shall now rule these mountains, as it rightfully should be, and it shall be done under a new flag, under a new nation, as one people!" 
sikkim.15.a:0 "We will unite the Himalayans as one!"

sikkim.18.t:0 "Sikkimese Raids!"
sikkim.18.d:0 "Reports have begun flurrying in of our trade routes and soldiers near the Eastern border being subject to savage raids from the neighbouring Kingdom of Sikkim. While there has been no word from the government of Sikkim, we are not blind. These bandits are not so foolhardy as to attempt to raid us on their own, whilst Sikkimese soldiers are conveniently looking away – it must be a provocation from Sikkim itself, to drag us into war. However, for such a minor nation, causing such a minor nuisance, it might not be such a bad idea as to stop them in their tracks in an act of overestimation." 
sikkim.18.a:0 "Show them the wrath of Nepal!"
sikkim.18.b:0 "We won't fall for their tricks that easily."

sikkim.19.t:0 "Sikkimese Raids!"
sikkim.19.d:0 "An envoy has arrived with reports of gangs of Sikkimese thugs and bandits harassing farmers and troops stationed by our border with the Kingdom from which they arrive. With no word from the Sikkimese government that may justify this blatant disruption of peace, we can only presume the worst. As simply as it may seem for us to wipe out this proverbial housefly to the wind, it may be important to exercise caution. After all, they would not just raid us without a plan…right?" 
sikkim.19.a:0 "Time to give Sikkim a good lesson on humility."
sikkim.19.b:0 "We are wiser than to risk further war."

Along with his brother Palden Thondup, he stands by his father’s side loyally and an honored friend and respected aid as well as a son. Seeking to bring further honor to his family while fulfilling a lifelong dream of flight, the Crown Prince attended an Anglo military school in Delhi in order to train to become a fighter pilot. Graduating with top honors and with hundreds of flight hours logged, Crown Prince Paljor is the greatest pilot to ever fly for Sikkim, and has since returned to Gangtok to serve as the new chief of the Sikkimese air force, tied to the functions of the Sikkim Guard. With Paljor defending our skies above as his father sits on the throne and guides the nation, the people of Sikkim can be sure that the Namgyals will keep them safe."

sikkim.17.d:0 "Rhoomo Lepcha - famed Sikkimese botanist, naturalist, and academic - has led a new botanical survey deep into the heart of the Sikkimese Himalayas in order to find new plant species for both ecological and medicinal study. Along with her is a small international group of botanists led by the German-American expert on plant anatomy Katherine Esau and the Japanese botanist and ethnologist Minakata Kumagusu, who specializes in fungal analysis while also having an interest in the local isolated minority groups within the mountain ranges of Sikkim. Together with other naturalists, this group seeks to further tap into the unknown and reveal more of the wonders our mountain paradise holds."

This paradise within the Himalayas, also called Drenjong by the Tibetans meaning the Hidden Valley of Rice, is one of the most isolated, pristine, and beatious places on Earth. For centuries, the Namgyal Dynasty has ruled over these lands, and for centuries, we have persisted despite the many obstacles thrown at us. However, with tensions brewing, radicalism spreading, and with the world seemingly on the brink of war yet again, all is not well in this mountainous paradise. We must remain vigilant as Chogyal Tashi Namgyal attempts to guide us through to prosperity."

skm_the_lamas_desc:0 "Sikkim is a land of faith and spirituality, with a ruling class along with a sizeable portion of the population being Buddhist, living in relative peace with a large Hindu population along with other smaller faithful minorities such as the Sikhs and the Jainists. However, no clerical group within Sikkim is more influential than the Buddhist Lamas, for even our beloved Chogyals are crowned by each incarnation of the Dalai Lama. Though dominant, their role in the government is often a large and messy grey area, and as such, we should move to formalize the role these holymen have in our Kingdom."

Sikkim is the Chogyal, and the Chogyal is Sikkim."

skm_assure_families_desc:0 "The landowning aristocratic families, such as the dominant and influential Kazi, hold great power and influence in Sikkim. They command great fortunes and sway due to their positions of power and nobility, and are only second to the Lamas and the Chogyal in terms of power over the nation. We must remain on their good sides if Tashi is to achieve anything during his reign, but that is easier said than done when his reforms fly directly in their faces. Amends and compromises must be made to assure the stability of the Kingdom, no matter how much this may anger the rising radical tide."

However, now having grown into a more aged and veteran leader, and with the various aristocratic families, the clergy, and the masses relatively in order, it is time for Tashi to try his luck at push towards his final goal - the modernization and democratization of the Kingdom of Sikkim and its economy through widespread land reform and the creation of a fair and populist parliamentary monarchy. However, with the rising popularity of the radically liberal Sikkim Kratiakari Morcha slowly growing more and more tired of the exploitation wrought at the hands of the aristocracy underneath but unshackled by the king, the continuation of this centuries-old monarchy is far from assured."

skm_land_reforms:0 "The Dire Need for Land Reforms"
skm_land_reforms_desc:0 "Sikkim’s economy is dominated by a feudal system in which lords and powerful families administer plots of land worked by a vast peasantry who cannot afford or are not allowed to own land. Tashi has worked tirelessly with the nobility in order to reach some forms of agreeable compromise, and has begun to transition some of Sikkim’s land into the hands of the masses. Small landowners have begun to rise up from the most hardworking, the most savvy, and the more influential of the lower classes. Though it is a far cry from a total break from feudalism, it is a massive step in a modern direction for such a tiny nation, and this change will be monitored closely as the masses of Sikkim step from 1666 into 1936."

To rectify this situation, Tashi has decided to open the doors of the institution for all Sikkimese students that can pass its entrance exam while simultaneously funding generous scholarships and a massive expansion of the campus.

All under the Chogyal shall be whole, and all under the Maharaja shall be at peace, for that is the will of Tashi Namgyal."

skm_expand_stnm:0 "Fund Sir Thutob Namgyal Memorial Hospital"
skm_expand_stnm_desc:0 "At the behest of His Majesty Tashi Namgyal, and utilizing state funding, the illustrious Sir Thutob Namgyal Memorial Hospital is to be expanded and further funded. First built in 1917 and named after his father, the STNMH is the finest healthcare center in the nation, located in the capital of Gangtok. A center of research, medical care, and both scientific and spiritual healing, the hospital shall never want for funding ever again, for it is the will of Tashi to bring reliable healthcare to his people."

skm_elections:0 "The Dawn of the Parliamentarian Dream"
skm_elections_desc:0 "With the bulk of his initially planned reforms now in effect, Tashi Namgyal, 11th Chogyal of the Kingdom of Sikkim, has finally decided to go through with his final dream for our paradise: to allow free and fair democratic elections. Though Tashi shall still reign as king, a civilian government - composed of both nobility and the common man - shall be created under the crown, aiding His Majesty in the rigors of statecraft. All parties are allowed to run in the elections, and whoever wins shall rise to aid Tashi as his loyal, but subservient, advisors and allies. Enlightened, Parliamentarian Monarchism shall finally blossom in the mountain paradise of Sikkim under the beloved Tashi Namgyal!"

skm_coup_moment:0 "Tashi’s Folly"
skm_coup_moment_desc:0 "With Chogyal Tashi refusing to heed the peaceful calls for reform as he bent to the cowardly and oppressive nobility, Jerman Lepcha and his Sikkim Krantikari Morcha have roused the peasants to revolt enmasse, toppling the 300 year old monarchy and the wicked aristocracy along with it. Our Sikkim is now finally free of the forces that suffocated us, and now Jerman Lepcha shall guide Sikkim into a fair, free, and equal Red Dawn."

skm_destroy_nobles:0 "Excise the Parasitic Nobility"
skm_destroy_nobles_desc:0 "Though Jerman preaches reconciliation, pacifism, and unity between the groups of Sikkim so that we can work towards a better and brighter future for all, there is one exception to this utopian dream - the nobility. Aristocratic families like the Namgyal Dynasty or the Kazis have oppressed the people and hoarded the wealth of Sikkim for far too long. Their lands will be nationalized and prepared for redistribution while their assets are liquidated and dispersed to government funds and programs as well as the masses, and they themselves will largely face exile, prison, or death, with only special exemptions being made for non-corrupt nobles that are members of the various clergies and other nobles that championed the cause of the people before Jerman’s rise. We'll cast these leeches from our proud land, and ensure punks like the Kazi never harm our proletarian paradise ever again."

skm_redistribute_land:0 "Socialized Land Redistribution"
skm_redistribute_land_desc:0 "With the nobility and their assets and estates liquidated and nationalized, the time has begun to redistribute these lands to the masses. Some shall be organized into collectivized farms while others shall be transferred to the hands of small landowners and entrepreneurs that promise not to exploit their laborers like the nobility once did, fusing the best ideas from across the ideological spectrum to suit the needs of our people as we try to move past our archaic reality."

skm_bhc_support:0 "Overtures to Calcutta"
skm_bhc_support_desc:0 "To the South lies the behemoth known as the Bharatiya Commune - one of the largest and most populated Socialist nations in Asia and one of our closest neighbors. Though we are far less radical than they, Calcutta is still the most obvious ally for our regime. We should request military advisors and economic support from these southern comrades so that the wider Eastern Revolution may progress more securely."

skm_radical_changes:0 "The Sikkimese Cultural Revolution"
skm_radical_changes_desc:0 "Championed by Jerman and his love of modern society, influenced by both the western Internationale and eastern movements such as the KMT, the INC, and various other groups in Korea, Indochina, and beyond. Pulling from these influences while still holding firm to Sikkimese culture, Jerman seeks to entirely revolutionize Sikkimese society and our very identity, creating a modernized, socialized society still tied to our various faiths and our long legacy. We shall be free of the stains of monarchism and feudalism as we progress into the modern age once and for all!"

skm_revolutionary_education:0 "Bring the Red Truth to the Masses"
skm_revolutionary_education_desc:0 "Every peasant in Sikkim, from the youngest child to the oldest Lama, should be taught our ideals and our new identity. Vast education reform, partially modeled on the ambitious plans the former Chogyal Tashi had for the nation’s educational system but decidedly more Socialist-inspired, shall be introduced across Sikki, so that every single soul in our state knows the truth about the Revolution, about Socialism, and about our role in the wide Revolutionary struggle, as well as the basic academic subjects all modern men should be privy to."

skm_revolutionary_zeal:0 "Revolutionary Zeal"
skm_revolutionary_zeal_desc:0 "We sit here at the crossroads of hungry-eyed empires and imperialist powers, and as such, we will need to defend ourselves. Indoctrinating each and every soul in the nation with a patriotic fervor and revolutionary zeal, they shall be radicalized to the point where they feel no fear as they defend our mountainous paradise from any threat. Sikkim must never fall, and we shall teach the population to ensure this never happens so long as a single son of Sikkim still draws breath."

skm_bridge_ethnic_gap:0 "Mend the Ethnic Divide"
skm_bridge_ethnic_gap_desc:0 "The various ethnic divides that have nearly torn our nation apart - largest and most damaging of which is the conflicts between the native Lepchas and the encroaching Nepalis - must finally be mended, and Jerman believes he is the man to finally do so. Funding a series of programs aimed at forced cooperation, increased dialogue, and wider education, Jerman shall mend the schisms that divide Sikkim whether the poplace wants to or not, for it is for the good of all Sikkimese souls, and Jerman knows this truth."

skm_role_in_revolution:0 "Sikkim’s Role in the World Revolution"
skm_role_in_revolution_desc:0 "With the Revolution being proven both triumphant and secure, the time has now come to consider our role in the wider international struggle. Our southern allies have pushed for our collective to join fully with their Indian state, but our proud sons of Sikkim detest this idea and have counter proposed that we remain an ally and buffer state. We must decide the future of our state as we march into our crimson destiny."
