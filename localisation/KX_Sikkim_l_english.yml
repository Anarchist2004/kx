#Leader Descriptions#

POLITICS_TASHI_NAMGYAL_DESC:0 "Crowned by the Dalai Lama in 1914 after the death of his half-brother, His Highness Sri Panch Maharaja Tashi Namgyal, Maharaja Chogyal of Sikkim, is the undisputed sovereign of the Kingdom of Sikkim. Born in Tibet in 1893, Tashi is only the most recent ruler in a dynastic line that has lasted since 1642. Nominally an absolute monarch, Tashi has infamously begun a crusade to reform and liberalize Sikkimese society, but this has come into conflict with the desires of the conservative nobility. Though he receives tacit support from more radical elements, many fear that the king may not be able to go far enough to truly modernize the archaic state of Sikkim, and so the 11th Chogyal walks a razor's edge here at the top of the world as he seeks to bring prosperity to this paradise amid the mountains."
POLITICS_JERMAN_LEPCHA_DESC:0 "Standing as the face of the radical reformist movement called the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha, Jerman Lepcha is the unity figure that binds the various reformist, liberal, and vaguely Socialist groups that seek a modern and prosperous Sikkim free of the nobility and the monarchy. Born in 1910, this young firebrand has waged a mostly peaceful, non-cooperative protest campaign against the deep-rooted and oppressive aristocracy, and now stands as the progressive savior of Sikkimese democracy. Seeking to bring agrarian-minded, Socialist-inspired total societal reform to this archaic land, Sikkim shall never be the same as Jerman guides it and his people towards a uniquely-Sikkimese modernity."

#Ideas#
SKM_ethnic_tensions:0 "The Chaotic Melting Pot of the Himalayas"
SKM_ethnic_tensions_desc:0 "Despite our tiny size, Sikkim is a land of diversity and ethno-religious friction. Between Hindus and Buddhists, our people cannot agree on matters of spirituality, and with bickering ethnic groups always chomping at the bit, our nation suffers from societal schisms. From the dominant Lepchas that control the monarchy and the South, to Limbus and Magars along with Tibetic speakers of the North, to the masses of Indians hailing from various ethno-linguistic groups, and even with the stray souls from China and Bhutan, our nation is at the crossroads of cultures, languages, religions, and empires, and this has turned us into the little melting pot of the Himalayas, for better or for worse. Regardless, these schisms must be mended if our Kingdom is to survive the relentless dawn of modernity."
SKM_archaic_economy:0 "An Archaic and Feudalistic Reality"
SKM_archaic_economy_desc:0 "It is no secret that Sikkim is not an economic superpower. Sikkim isn’t even a regional or local power, and this harsh reality blatantly and painfully shows across the nation. Much of our people live their lives as poor peasants, working fields and paying tithes to the nobility in a feudal system that has existed for centuries. If Sikkim is ever to reach modernity and prosperity, drastic changes must come to our ‘Secret Land of Rice’ among the Himalayas."
SKM_landowning_elite:0 "Dominance of the Nobility"
SKM_landowning_elite_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Sikkim has been under the thumb of the nobility for centuries, and atop this hierarchy is the Namgyal Dynasty and the largest and most dominant aristocratic clan - the Kazis. From forcing peasants to parade them around in palanquins to working their serfs to the bone in the fields, these blue-bloods rule with an iron fist gilded in gold, and with one hand in the national coffers at all times. However, the current Chogyal is noted for his desire to reform this reality, and from within the shadows, relatively peaceful Socialist revolutionaries clamor for their time to strike, egged on by foreign backers and united by the infamous Jerman Lepcha. The nobility may be dominant, but they walk a delicate tight-rope, and if they are not careful, these aristocrats may finally be pushed from their lofty position."
SKM_chogyal:0 "The 11th Chogyal, Maharaja of Sikkim"
SKM_chogyal_desc:0 "His Highness Sri Panch Maharaja Tashi Namgyal, Maharaja Chogyal of Sikkim, or Bkra-shis Rnam-rgyal, is the 11th Chogyal, or king, and current Maharaja of our paradise, ruling over both the Buddhist and Hindu populations as the one true ruler of the Kingdom of Sikkim. Succeeding his half-brother who died of heart failure in 1914 after only reigning for eleven months, Tashi has stood as the most powerful man in Sikkim for decades. Despite pushback from the nobility - and especially from the Kazis - Tashi is a reformer at heart. His dream for Sikkim is to create a fair and free parliamentary monarchy with himself at the helm, supported by a democratically elected council to aid him in matters of statecraft and beyond. However, this dream is far easier said than done, and the 11th Chogyal will have to be careful, for the scavenging leopards have already begun to circle the reformer king’s throne."

sikkim.1.t:0 "The New Year Dawns on Paradise"
sikkim.1.d:0 "Literally called paradise - Nye-mae-el - by the Lepcha, the dominant ethnic group of the nation, Sikkim is a beautiful and storied mountain refuge safe from the wider world, or at least, it was once isolated. Now, Sikkim has been held hostage in a diplomatic game of tug-of-war, for Sikkim sits at the crossroads of empires on this sliver of the mighty Himalayas. \n\nSikkim has been a monarchy since 1642, dominated by the Namgyal dynasty for over 300 years despite the rise of numerous other empires including the colonial behemoth of the British. A Buddhist family tied to the Lamas ruling over a multi-ethnic and multi-religious state is no easy task, but the Namgyals have managed to keep the Kingdom of Sikkim together for centuries. However, this legacy is now being tested more than ever. \n\nWhen the Raj fell in the wake of the British Revolution, Sikkim was one of hundreds of states to break free from the dying carcass of British Imperialism, but Sikkim now stands nearly alone as a post-Raj state free from the main Indian factions. This independence was not widely wanted outside our borders however, for Nepal, Bhutan, and what has now become the Bharatiya Commune have all tried to absorb our mountain kingdom. Their efforts have all been kept at bay due to the nation’s close ties with and guarantees of national sovereignty by Tibet, for the Lamas of Tibetan Buddhism and the royal family, as well as much of the nobility, have been closely linked for as long as the kingdom has existed. A nominal subject of the Qing, Tibet has been able to defend Sikkim’s independence, but with the wavering Manchu dynasty close to collapse, Tibet is no longer in any position to be able to waste troops guarding foreign borders. \n\nAs the Qing inch closer to collapse, the wolves that circle our kingdom only grow more bold, and soon our independence will surely be tested unless we do something first. It is up to the 11th Chogyal - or king - and Maharaja of Sikkim, His Highness Tashi Namgyal, to guide the nation through the fires of foreign diplomacy while dealing with the rising tides of radicalism and greater calls for reforms. Seeking to liberalize and modernize the nation despite pushback from powerful aristocratic families like the Kazi, Chogyal Tashi must strike a balance and mend the schisms that divide Sikkim lest this paradise come to a burning end under the boots of foreign powers."
sikkim.1.a:0 "Sikkim, Kham-sum-wangdu!"

sikkim.2.t:0 "Tashi’s Gambit for the Reformation of Sikkim"
sikkim.2.d:0 "Chogyal Tashi has long desired to reform Sikkimese society in a major way, pushing for sweeping reforms to the educational system, the healthcare system, the judiciary, the nobility, the economy, and more, virtually rebuilding all of Sikkimese society from the ground up. These reforms would slowly see Sikkim transformed into a mixed-economy populist monarchy supported by a modernized, primarily agrarian industry, greatly expanded social and civil rights, and most groundbreaking of all - the end of the neo-feudal system dominated by the nobility through sweeping land reform and the creation of a true, democratically elected Sikkimese parliament. Modeled on the Indian Congress as well as from both the British and German systems, Tashi seeks to create a syncretic ideology formfit for Sikkim’s unique reality with the wellbeing of the masses as the key concern, earning him the nickname the People’s Chogyal. \n\nHowever, this reformation has one large and near-immovable obstacle - the nobility. Traditionalist, conservative, and resistant to change in most forms, these influential and affluent aristocrats may be subservient to the crown, but there is no secret they truly run Sikkim. If Tashi is to be able to push his desired reforms, he will have to break with most of them, losing him much support that would hopefully be replaced by the democratic and supportive voices of the masses, or he will be forced to heavily compromise his vision. Supporting Tashi, at least for now, is Jerman Lepcha and his band of radical liberal reformers in the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha - a band of peaceful reform-minded protestors pushing for the democratization and liberalization of Sikkimese society. However, though they are peaceful now, Jerman has sworn that should Tashi break his promises for effective reform, he and his growing band of followers will have no other choice than to take matters into their own hands. \n\nWith all this in mind, and with over two decades of ruling experience and preparation already behind him, it is finally time for the 11th Chogyal to decide the ultimate fate of his paradisiacal kingdom."
sikkim.2.a:0 "I am Chogyal, and what I say goes! The final reforms shall be begun!"
sikkim.2.b:0 "We must heed the word of the nobles. It’s not like the serfs will actually revolt."

sikkim.3.t:0 "The Peasant Coup"
sikkim.3.d:0 "With Chogyal Tashi bending to the whims of the spoiled nobility, Jerman and his SKM have decided to drop their pacifistic opposition, taking up arms across the nation in a hastily organized but well-prepared revolution. Using the mountainous terrain and lack of infrastructure or good communications to their advantage, the rebels have already seized the capital after slaughtering the Sikkim Guard garrisoning the royal palace. Though they took ten times the losses themselves, the peasantry have numbers on their side, and it would seem that all hope for the monarchy and the nobility it lost. Jerman Lepcha was true to his word, and with Tashi’s refusal to go through with his reforms, the Tigerslayer himself has risen to lead a new Socialist-inspired but largely non-radical republican government. The centuries-old reign of the Namgyal dynasty is finally at an end as the Sikkimese Revolution comes to a hasty end."
sikkim.3.a:0 "I guess the Chogyal was wrong."

sikkim.4.t:0 "Our Role in the Revolution"
sikkim.4.d:0 "Sikkim has come to embrace its new liberalized and socialized future, and under Jerman Lepcha, our mountain paradise has finally come to embrace its reformative future. However, with our collective now stable and progressing peacefully towards an equal and fair society for all true Sikkimese sons, our place in the wider international revolutionary struggle must be determined. \n\nOur allies and benefactors to the South in Calcutta have aided us greatly, but it is no secret that many within their ranks do not do so out of Socialist unity and camaraderie. The Indians have desired our Sikkim to meld into their borders since our independence was secured after the death of the Raj, and now that we are aligned and closer than we have been since the age of colonial rule, Calcutta has pushed heavily for our complete integration. However, we are a proud people with our own identity and history, and as such, Jerman has resisted this push, instead declaring that we must remain as independent, equal, but loyal allies to the southern colossus, safeguarding our sovereignty as we march together towards a truly prosperous future. With Calcutta pressuring us more and more, Jerman must decide the fate of Sikkim soon."
sikkim.4.a:0 "Sikkim is strong! We shall never cede our sovereignty again!"
sikkim.4.b:0 "We must join the Southern Giant. Move towards union with India."

sikkim.5.t:0 "The First Sikkimese Elections"
sikkim.5.d:0 "Finalizing his sweeping reforms with the pinnacle of his planned liberalizations, Chogyal Tashi has begun to usher in true parliamentary democracy to our paradisiacal Kingdom of Sikkim. Though the king shall still be the absolute and final voice in any and all matters, this democratically elected civilian government will support Tashi as he seeks to further transform Sikkimese society. The main parties are less parties and more just groupings of interest groups within the royal court and among the peasantry - a sort of pro-multiparty democracy that will surely come to become more organized and distinct over time. Safeguarding tradition and resisting most reforms are nobility, who cling to the status quo. Slightly less of an obstacle to full reform are the various princes and monarchist loyalists sworn to Tashi, who desire some small, token reforms to preserve stability without any real changes to the status quo. Opposing these noble-centric groups are the varied reformist factions, which range from small landowners and merchants - our meager but growing middle class - who push for liberal and modernist reforms modeled on Western and Eastern democracies, to the radical peasantry who are split between more liberal-minded monarchists and the radical, Socialist-inspired forces of Jerman Lepcha’s SKM. Whichever faction wins out, Tashi shall still remain as the sole face of Sikkim, but whoever is chosen shall work with our Chogyal to guide Sikkim into its new and democratized future. With the votes being counted by Tashi and his aides themselves, the results are soon to be announced, and the winner shall be..."
sikkim.5.a:0 "The traditionalist nobility secures the status quo."
sikkim.5.b:0 "The conservative nobility and Tashi loyalists force the status quo to budge."
sikkim.5.c:0 "The moderate reformists championed by our growing landowner class wins out."
sikkim.5.e:0 "The liberal reformists led by the non-radical peasantry secures a win."
sikkim.5.f:0 "The radical reformists of Jerman Lepcha seize the day."

sikkim.6.t:0 "The Lamas"
sikkim.6.d:0 "The Lamas of Sikkim are the highest level of the Buddhist clergy, second only to the Chogyal in influence, though the nobility frequently rivals this power. Spiritually guiding the nation from beautiful and ancient monasteries such as Rumtek, Dubdi, and Ralang, these disciples of the Buddha are Sikkim’s enduring link to their past and their cyclical future. Loyal to the crown and to the Namgyal dynasty as well as the Dalai Lama in Tibet, these clergymen usually put matters of the faith above all, and are frequently mediators and arbiters of conflict within the nation, safeguarding tradition while seeking to bring unity to the varied population. Under their guidance, Sikkim remains tied to its beliefs and its past, and together they help form the fabric of Sikkim’s varied society."
sikkim.6.a:0 "Our ties to the beyond."

sikkim.7.t:0 "The Aristocracy"
sikkim.7.d:0 "Sikkim may be led by the Chogyal, but its society and its people are dominated by the aristocracy. All across our mountain paradise, various influential, wealthy, and domineering noble families and interest groups dominate the peasantry. From forcing them to work the fields as serfs to even subjecting them to carry each noble around in a personalized palanquin, the nobility has held the Sikkimese peasantry under their thumb for centuries, enabling the persistence of a semi-Feudalist society that has stagnated and grown archaic as the rest of the world around us dashed towards modernity. Most powerful of all the noble groups are the Kazis, a group of affluent and highly influential noble contractors and princes poised as the traditionalist anchor of Sikkim. They resist any and all pushes for liberalization and modernization in order to safeguard their positions of power, and are largely led by Kazi Lhendup Dorjee of the Khangsarpa family. Young but fiercely dedicated to Sikkimese tradition, Lhendup leads the Kazis and other noble groups to stand as Chogyal Tashi’s largest obstacle to reform."
sikkim.7.a:0 "Our ties to the past."

sikkim.8.t:0 "The Chogyal"
sikkim.8.d:0 "The Chogyal, or king, of Sikkim has been a position for over 300 years, and has only been held by pure-blooded members of the Namgyal dynasty. Currently, the reformist-minded 11th Chogyal commands the nation, seeking to drive Sikkim towards modernity without losing sight of its storied past. Crowned by the Dalai Lama in 1914 after the death of his half-brother, His Highness Sri Panch Maharaja Tashi Namgyal, Maharaja Chogyal of Sikkim, is the undisputed sovereign of the Kingdom of Sikkim. Born in Tibet in 1893, Tashi is only the most recent ruler in a dynastic line that has lasted since 1642, but his rule is quite unique. Nominally an absolute monarch, Tashi has infamously begun a crusade to reform and liberalize Sikkimese society, but this has come into conflict with the desires of the conservative nobility. Though he receives tacit support from more radical elements led by Jerman Lepcha and his SKM, many fear that the king may not be able to go far enough to truly modernize the archaic state of Sikkim. With instability mounting and with the nobility and the peasantry more rowdy than ever, the 11th Chogyal Tashi Namgyal walks a razor's edge here at the top of the world as he seeks to bring prosperity to this paradise amid the mountains."
sikkim.8.a:0 "Our path to the future."

sikkim.9.t:0 "Sikkim Calls for Aid"
sikkim.9.d:0 "We have received a message from an envoy sent out by Tashi Namgyal, King of Sikkim, requesting aid and support in his endeavours in return for closer ties between our nations. Considering how this envoy must have trekked across the Himalayas with some of the most treacherous conditions present just to make deliver this message, some of our supporters believe Sikkim to be in true danger, and we must provide aid immediately. Others are still not convinced and see no reason to waste precious time and resource into such an irrelevant speck of land. What response shall we send the envoy back with?"
sikkim.9.a:0 "Namgyal shall have our full support!"
sikkim.9.b:0 "Begone, we have no need for Sikkim."

sikkim.10.t:0 "Sikkim Calls for Aid"
sikkim.10.d:0 "In a matter of strange circumstances, a diplomat under the orders of the King of Sikkim, Tashi Namgyal, has arrived in Delhi, expressing that the micronation that was once under our rule seeks out our aid against the Socialists creeping up upon them. This could be a good opportunity for us to limit the Red’s influence in the Himalayas further – if they were to conquer Sikkim, then Nepal would surely come next, and that is a risk that we cannot ignore. However, there is still much to do back in the Homefront, and Sikkim is certainly not going to be providing us with much of anything. How shall we respond?"
sikkim.10.a:0 "We can always spare a little help."
sikkim.10.b:0 "We are far too busy to send aid. Best of luck!"

sikkim.11.t:0 "Sikkim Calls for Aid"
sikkim.11.d:0 "One of the main goals of the Commune of France is to foster Syndicalism worldwide, to one degree or another, and often we get many diplomats, generals, and exiled politicians seeking financial and military support from us. However, today’s ‘guest’ is not an envoy, diplomat, or any person for that matter – it is in fact a letter from the faraway land of Sikkim, of whom wish aid in the form of supplies directly from us, to help foster their socialist cause. Many members of the foreign office, understandably, are hesitant. There is little to no news of this land, or the state of its people. Some in our government cannot even point to where it might be on the global map. For all we know, this can be all an elaborate hoax. However, we cannot allow a Socialist nation’s cry for help to go unheeded, out of our sheer principles. What is to be done?"
sikkim.11.a:0 "Very well, let’s hope this is not some reactionary plot to waste our time."
sikkim.11.b:0 "As if we would ever believe in a country called ‘Sikkim’!"

sikkim.12.t:0 "Sikkim Calls for Aid"
sikkim.12.d:0 "Once again, we have received a request from our tiny ally to the north requesting more aid in order to build its industry and military. For such a small nation, their request is easily doable. Let us just hope they put it to good use, one way or another."
sikkim.12.a:0 "Anything for our Revolution!"

sikkim.13.t:0 "The Ghorkas rise up!"
sikkim.13.d:0 "Instigated by our foe to the north in the form of Sikkim of all places, Nepali Ghorkas in Darjeeling have begun to rebel against our rule en masse, rising up against us in order to bend the knee to the Kingdom of Sikkim! How this came about, we have no idea, but it is vital that we respond to this blatant act of war immediately!"
sikkim.13.a:0 "Let them go, they’re not worth the fight."
sikkim.13.b:0 "To war!"

sikkim.14.t:0 "At the Top of the World"
sikkim.14.d:0 "Against all odds, we have finally come out on top as the sole ruler of the Himalayas. With the Nepalese under our heel and the foolish Dragon King of Bhutan humbled, we have shown the world the true might that is Sikkim. However, none of this would have been possible without the guidance and wisdom of our beloved King of the Himalayas, Tashi Namgyal. His vision for Sikkim does not end here however – now, he seeks to integrate the new lands under our flag as one nation, defined by the true faith of Buddhism. As his people rejoice, his subjugated subjects watch in horror. Only time will tell how this new powerhouse of Asia shall fare." 
sikkim.14.a:0 "We will be the true King of the Mountains!"

sikkim.15.t:0 "Uniting the Mountains"
sikkim.15.d:0 "After a long struggle, we have achieved the impossible; centuries of despotic rule have finally ended in the Himalayas as Jerman Lepcha addresses the hundreds of onlookers attend his celebratory ceremony in the centre of Gangtok. While the journey has been arduous for our people, with help from the Bharatiya Commune and sheer perseverance, we have emerged victorious. The peasantry shall now rule these mountains, as it rightfully should be, and it shall be done under a new flag, under a new nation, as one people!" 
sikkim.15.a:0 "We will unite the Himalayans as one!"

sikkim.18.t:0 "Sikkimese Raids!"
sikkim.18.d:0 "Reports have begun flurrying in of our trade routes and soldiers near the Eastern border being subject to savage raids from the neighbouring Kingdom of Sikkim. While there has been no word from the government of Sikkim, we are not blind. These bandits are not so foolhardy as to attempt to raid us on their own, whilst Sikkimese soldiers are conveniently looking away – it must be a provocation from Sikkim itself, to drag us into war. However, for such a minor nation, causing such a minor nuisance, it might not be such a bad idea as to stop them in their tracks in an act of overestimation." 
sikkim.18.a:0 "Show them the wrath of Nepal!"
sikkim.18.b:0 "We won't fall for their tricks that easily."

sikkim.19.t:0 "Sikkimese Raids!"
sikkim.19.d:0 "An envoy has arrived with reports of gangs of Sikkimese thugs and bandits harassing farmers and troops stationed by our border with the Kingdom from which they arrive. With no word from the Sikkimese government that may justify this blatant disruption of peace, we can only presume the worst. As simply as it may seem for us to wipe out this proverbial housefly to the wind, it may be important to exercise caution. After all, they would not just raid us without a plan…right?" 
sikkim.19.a:0 "Time to give Sikkim a good lesson on humility."
sikkim.19.b:0 "We are wiser than to risk further war."

sikkim.16.t:0 "The Pilot Prince"
sikkim.16.d:0 "The Crown Prince Paljor Namgyal, also called Kunzang Cholay Namgyal, is the eldest son and heir apparent to Tashi Namgyal. Along with his brother Palden Thondup, he stands by his father’s side loyally as an honored friend and respected aid as well as a son. Seeking to bring further honor to his family while fulfilling a lifelong dream of flight, the Crown Prince attended an Anglo military school in Delhi in order to train to become a fighter pilot. Graduating with top honors and with hundreds of flight hours logged, Crown Prince Paljor is the greatest pilot to ever fly for Sikkim, and has since returned to Gangtok to serve as the new chief of the Sikkimese air force, tied to the functions of the Sikkim Guard. With Paljor defending our skies above as his father sits on the throne and guides the nation, the people of Sikkim can be sure that the Namgyals will keep them safe."
sikkim.16.a:0 "A true hero of Sikkim."

sikkim.17.t:0 "Rhomoo Lepcha’s Botanical Genius"
sikkim.17.d:0 "Rhoomo Lepcha - famed Sikkimese botanist, naturalist, and academic - has led a new botanical survey deep into the heart of the Sikkimese Himalayas in order to find new plant species for both ecological and medicinal study. Along with her is a small international group of botanists led by the German-American expert on plant anatomy Katherine Esau and the Japanese botanist and ethnologist Minakata Kumagusu, who specializes in fungal analysis while also having an interest in the local isolated minority groups within the mountain ranges of Sikkim. Together with other naturalists, this group seeks to further tap into the unknown and reveal more of the wonders our mountain paradise holds."
sikkim.17.a:0 "We can learn much from this!"

sikkim.20.t:0 "An Old Monument Made New"
sikkim.20.d:0 "Seeking to restore more aspects of both his own family’s legacy and the history of the Kingdom while also proving to the conservative nobility that he is still dedicated to tradition despite his reforms, Tashi Namgyal has utilized more of his personal funds to restore historic and spiritual sites across the nation, from various monasteries and burial sites to stupas and palaces. Most recent of his grand restorations was the total facelift of the Norbugang Chorten - the stupa created by the first Chogyal Phuntsog Nagmyal in 1642 after his coronation by the three highest Lamas in Sikkim at Yuksom. The sacred and serene Kuthok lake is also nearby and of great significance to the monarchy and to local Buddhists, and has become a common pilgrimage site as well thanks to Tashi’s renovations and funding. Sites like these and many others will continue to be renovated as the 11th Chogyal seeks to hold on to our storied past as he progresses to the future."
sikkim.20.a:0 "We honor the first Chogyal and the legacy he enabled."

sikkim.21.t:0 "The Colossus of Sikkim"
sikkim.21.d:0 "The Colossus of Sikkim, Barmiok Athing Tashi Dadul Densapa is the loyal and ever-vigilant right-hand man to Chogyal Tashi. Formally, he is the Nyer-Tsang-Chenmo, or Chief Steward of the Palace, but in practice, he is the closest political ally and lifelong friend of our beloved King. Born in 1902 as the son of a former Chief Steward, Athingla - as he his traditionally called - received formal education at both Colonial Anglo and Tibetan schools before rising to his first government position, and from there he befriended Tashi and climbed the ranks of the Sikkimese hierarchy until he was the chief confidant and advisor to the 11th Chogyal. Standing by his king through his push for reforms and the rise of radicalism and the influence of the Kazis, the Grand Man of Sikkim Athingla aids Tashi loyally and devoutly in this mountainous paradise, safeguarding traditional Sikkimese society and religion against corrosive forces while aiding his friend and liege."

sikkim.22.d:0 "With Jerman waging war against the nobility, many have begun to wonder and question what they should do with the former Chogyal. Since their revolution, Tashi has been confined to house arrest within his palace as Jerman slowly contemplated on what to do with the former monarch. Hardliners and radicals in the party demand his death - to be killed in the same fashion as the Kazis once tried to kill Jerman, by tying him to a table and letting a caged and starving tiger do the rest - but others say elsewise. Many believe that his reformist ambitions, though compromised and failed, earn him some merit, and these groups have come up with two alternate solutions - either send him into exile where he will likely go stay with the entourage of the Dalai Lama, or force him to become a monk in the hallowed Rumtek Monastery where he could do no harm."
sikkim.22.a:0 "There is only one acceptable fate. Send him to the tiger pit!"
sikkim.22.b:0 "Force him to swear the vows and live with the Lamas of Rumtek Monastery."
sikkim.22.c:0 "Banish him to Tibet!"

sikkim.23.t:0 "Meeting an Old Friend"
sikkim.23.d:0 "With the announcement that the newest incarnation of the Dalai Lama had been founded and returned to Tibet, Chogyal Tashi immediately embarked to see his old friend in his new form. Leaving with an extravagant entourage to Lhasa, Tashi and the various countries and lamas accompanying him were abuzz, but this all mellowed soon after they arrived.\n\nFinally arriving at their destination at Potala Palace, Tashi met with his reborn friend, who was now just a young baby from the northern villages. Awkwardly ‘admitting’ he recognized the boy as his old and dear friend, Tashi and the baby Dalai Lama spent some time together as Tashi reminisced old stories about him and the boy’s past life. With their bond reconnected across time and space, Tashi has exclaimed he shall be like an uncle to his old friend, and plans to make frequent visits to Lhasa to help raise and guide the spiritual leader’s new form."
sikkim.23.a:0 "Surely they recognize each other?"

sikkim.24.t:0 "A Brush With Death"
sikkim.24.d:0 "Sitting at the counter within the local inn inside his personal dzong fortress, Jerman relaxed with many of his fellow revolutionaries as they recounted stories of mystery and awe. However, never to be beaten, Jerman had just the story to light a spark in his followers. Casting back to his time spent in prison after being arrested by the Kazis for peacefully obstructing a noble’s palanquin forcibly lifted on the backs of serfs, Jerman described the time he killed a tiger with his own two hands. \n\nTied to a table by his captors and left in a room with a starved and deranged apex predator, Jerman was able to break free from his bonds before the beast could get a hold of him before strangling the beast to death using all his remaining strength. With the beast slain, Jerman made his escape before the guards had noticed the tiger did not make its easy kill, and retreated into the mountains where he survived for days on his own before being picked up by loyal revolutionary allies. \n\nAs always, the story excited his men, sparking to life their morale and their dedication to their reformationist cause. They knew that all they had to do was follow Jerman the Tiger Slayer and Sikkim would reach prosperity."
sikkim.24.a:0 "Clearly you've never fought a tiger."

sikkim.25.t:0 "The Sikkimese Gandhi"
sikkim.25.d:0 "Jerman Lepcha is a well-known reformer and proponent of peaceful resistance, waging a non-violent war of protest against the Kazis and other corrupt and oppressive nobles. Organizing sit-ins, boycotts, prayer vigils, group fastings, marches, and more to resist the aristocratic parasites, Jerman is the voice and face of a free republican future for Sikkim. However, his detractors and opponents do not share his dedication to nonviolence, and much blood has been spilled on the side of Jerman and his allies. Despite it all, Jerman persists, holding faith that Chogyal Tashi will see his dedication and follow through on his promise of sweeping reform, for if he did not, all hope for a peaceful resolution would be lost in the eyes of Jerman."
sikkim.25.a:0 "Let him complain. It’s not like he will do anything."

skm_sikkim_new_year_desc:0 "Nye-mae-el in Lepcha - the dominant language used in Sikkim - means ‘paradise’, and it is by this name that the locals call their Sikkim. This paradise within the Himalayas, also called Drenjong by the Tibetans meaning the Hidden Valley of Rice, is one of the most isolated, pristine, and beatious places on Earth. For centuries, the Namgyal Dynasty has ruled over these lands, and for centuries, we have persisted despite the many obstacles thrown at us. However, with tensions brewing, radicalism spreading, and with the world seemingly on the brink of war yet again, all is not well in this mountainous paradise. We must remain vigilant as Chogyal Tashi Namgyal attempts to guide us through to prosperity."

skm_the_lamas:0 "The Role of the Lamas"
skm_the_lamas_desc:0 "Sikkim is a land of faith and spirituality, with a ruling class along with a sizeable portion of the population being Buddhist, living in relative peace with a large Hindu population along with other smaller faithful minorities such as the Sikhs and the Jainists. However, no clerical group within Sikkim is more influential than the Buddhist Lamas, for even our beloved Chogyals are crowned by each incarnation of the Dalai Lama. Though dominant, their role in the government is often a large and messy grey area, and as such, we should move to formalize the role these holymen have in our Kingdom."

skm_chogyals_authority:0 "All Under the Chogyal"
skm_chogyals_authority_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Sikkim has endured under the first and only Namgyal dynasty since 1642, standing resolute as an absolutist monarchy safeguarding Sikkimese society and tradition. Despite Tashi’s reformist goals, he is still the final authority in all matters, and all within our mountaintop paradise is under his gaze and within his grasp. Sikkim is the Chogyal, and the Chogyal is Sikkim."

skm_assure_families:0 "Reassurances to the Nobility"
skm_assure_families_desc:0 "The landowning aristocratic families, such as the dominant and influential Kazi, hold great power and influence in Sikkim. They command great fortunes and sway due to their positions of power and nobility, and are only second to the Lamas and the Chogyal in terms of power over the nation. We must remain on their good sides if Tashi is to achieve anything during his reign, but that is easier said than done when his reforms fly directly in their faces. Amends and compromises must be made to assure the stability of the Kingdom, no matter how much this may anger the rising radical tide."

skm_reform_issue:0 "Tashi’s Ambition"
skm_reform_issue_desc:0 "Tashi has reigned as the Chogyal since the death of his half-brother in 1914, and his rule has been marked by an unheard of push for reformation. However, now having grown into a more aged and veteran leader, and with the various aristocratic families, the clergy, and the masses relatively in order, it is time for Tashi to try his luck at push towards his final goal - the modernization and democratization of the Kingdom of Sikkim and its economy through widespread land reform and the creation of a fair and populist parliamentary monarchy. However, with the rising popularity of the radically liberal Sikkim Kratiakari Morcha slowly growing more and more tired of the exploitation wrought at the hands of the aristocracy underneath but unshackled by the king, the continuation of this centuries-old monarchy is far from assured."

skm_workers_rights_desc:0 "Seeking to raise the peasantry from feudalist serfdom and into modern and protected laborers and workers in both an agrarian and, albeit small, industrial setting, Tashi has begun to set forth a series of decrees granting sweeping rights and protections to the masses. Under their ‘People’s Chogyal,’ the workers of Sikkim shall finally be free to make a fair and honest living without the demeaning spectre of subservient serfdom."

skm_land_reforms:0 "The Dire Need for Land Reforms"
skm_land_reforms_desc:0 "Sikkim’s economy is dominated by a feudal system in which lords and powerful families administer plots of land worked by a vast peasantry who cannot afford or are not allowed to own land. Tashi has worked tirelessly with the nobility in order to reach some forms of agreeable compromise, and has begun to transition some of Sikkim’s land into the hands of the masses. Small landowners have begun to rise up from the most hardworking, the most savvy, and the more influential of the lower classes. Though it is a far cry from a total break from feudalism, it is a massive step in a modern direction for such a tiny nation, and this change will be monitored closely as the masses of Sikkim step from 1666 into 1936."

To rectify this situation, Tashi has decided to open the doors of the institution for all Sikkimese students that can pass its entrance exam while simultaneously funding generous scholarships and a massive expansion of the campus. This is all poised to make the Tashi Namgyal Academy the greatest university in Sikkim, and perhaps the greatest university in all the Himalayas."

Though Tashi shall still reign as king, a civilian government - composed of both nobility and the common man - shall be created under the crown, aiding His Majesty in the rigors of statecraft. All parties are allowed to run in the elections, and whoever wins shall rise to aid Tashi as his loyal, but subservient, advisors and allies. Enlightened, Parliamentarian Monarchism shall finally blossom in the mountain paradise of Sikkim under the beloved Tashi Namgyal!"

skm_destroy_nobles_desc:0 "Though Jerman preaches reconciliation, pacifism, and unity between the groups of Sikkim so that we can work towards a better and brighter future for all, there is one exception to this utopian dream - the nobility. Aristocratic families like the Namgyal Dynasty or the Kazis have oppressed the people and hoarded the wealth of Sikkim for far too long. Their lands will be nationalized and prepared for redistribution while their assets are liquidated and dispersed to government funds and programs as well as the masses, and they themselves will largely face exile, prison, or death, with only special exemptions being made for non-corrupt nobles that are members of the various clergies and other nobles that championed the cause of the people before Jerman’s rise.
