# General Events
royalist.1.t: "Return of the King"
royalist.1.d: "King Michael I of Romania returned to his home country. After landing with a small plane the King was quickly driven to Iasi where a large crowd eagerly awaited his arrival. While elsewhere in the city police and army elements rounded up some fanatic Iron Guard members, in the centre people came together to celebrate this momentous occasion. Over all this looms the threat of the imminent civil war, and already shots can be heard. Romania will go through some very dark times. But for now, we celebrate the return of the King!"
royalist.1.a: "We will fight for you!"

royalist.2.t: "Return of the King"
royalist.2.d: "King Michael I of Romania returned to his home country. After landing with a small plane the King was quickly driven to Bucharest where a large crowd eagerly awaited his arrival.\n\nAt arrival, the King assured the gathered people he will reign in cooperation with all those who have only the progress of Romania in mind, without paying attention to party lines or previous quarrels. The return of the King ushers a new era for Romania indeed."
royalist.2.a: "Welcome back!"

royalist.3.t: "The Front of National Resurrection"
royalist.3.d: "Quickly after loyal officers seized parts of Romania talks begun between different groups keen on defeating the Iron Guard. This has resulted in a wartime coalition of democratic parties, businessmen and the army, called the Front of National Resurrection (FRN). Different democratic parties, persecuted under the autocratic regime, have been re-established in Iasi. Some important businessmen have pledged their loyalty to the King and denounced the Guard. A temporary military government will govern the country until the Iron Guard has been defeated."
royalist.3.a: "As long as we fight together..."

royalist.4.t: "Calls For Elections"
royalist.4.d: "Officals representing the different democratic parties in the FRN coalition have called upon the King for organizing elections. The last elections were quite some time ago, and were not free under the military regimes preceding the Iron Guard. Some people in the government argue that it is too early to already organise nation-wide elections, and that we need to focus first on rebuilding the country. On the other hand, delaying the elections will certainly lead to dissent of the increasingly popular Liberal and Peasants parties."
royalist.4.a: "The King acknowledges their demands."
royalist.4.a.tt: "This will likely lead to the disintegration of the wartime coalition."
royalist.4.b: "The King orders preparations for the elections."
royalist.4.b.tt: "The parties will be satisfied for now."

royalist.5.t: "Democrats Demand Elections"
royalist.5.d: "Officals representing the different democratic parties in the FRN coalition have made an ultimatum to the country leadership: organise elections within 30 days or they will withdraw their support from the government. Given their increasing popularity this would be a blow to the legitimacy of the military government."
royalist.5.a: "Organise elections."
royalist.5.a.tt: "Elections will take place in §Y30 days§!."
royalist.5.b: "It is not the time yet."
royalist.5.b.tt: "Democratic parties will withdraw from the FRN.\n\n"

royalist.6.t: "PNT and PNL Withdraw From the FRN"
royalist.6.d: "The largest democratic parties in the FRN coalition have today announced they have withdrawed their support. The National Liberal Party (PNL), one of the main political forces of Romania before de 1930s, has been re-established under the leadship of Ion Duca.\n\nThe former Peasants Party has also reorganised with Iuliu Maniu as its leader, and has renamed itself to the National Peasants Party (PNT). In addition to several smaller parties they want to partake in any upcoming elections."
royalist.6.a: "Oh well."

royalist.7.t: "Appointing a New Cabinet"
royalist.7.d: "Now that elections will be organised, it is clear the FRN has come to an end. General Argeseanu had a meeting with the King today where he told him that he would resign. With two main parties, there are two options for a caretaker government.\n\nThe King can appoint Constantin Bratianu from the National Liberal Party as new Prime Minister. Bratianu is known as staunch anti-Iron Guard, and will likely take immediate action and encourage any White Terror activities.\n\nThe other option is Iuliu Maniu of the National Peasants Party. The PNT does not want to take a hard stand against the Iron Guard, but rather wants to cooperate with their sympathisers to build a new Romania together. He will probably try to stop the White Terror."
royalist.7.a: "The King appoints Constantin Bratianu."
royalist.7.b: "The King appoints Iuliu Maniu."

royalist.8.t: "The White Terror"
royalist.8.d: "The reign of the Iron Guard is finally over. Their regime has left Romania scarred and it will take time for the wounds to heal. But many who have bled under Codreanu's dictatorship now take right in their own hands. More and more reports are coming in of loyalist troops plundering houses and shops of know Iron Guard sympathisers. In some cities militias have formed who arrest people left and right and quickly try them for ad hoc tribunals, before they are executed or set to work on repairing the damages done in the earlier fighting.\n\nIf the government does not act, these White Terror activities might spiral out of control. On the other hand, Iron Guard members might slip through our fingers and reorganise."
royalist.8.a: "All Legionnaires have to be purged."
royalist.8.b: "Direct the army to restore order."

royalist.9.t: "More White Terror activities"
royalist.9.d: "The increasing amount of White Terror activities has lead to more chaos in our country. The police and the army have their hands full but can not stop all atrocities commited. At this rate Romania slowly moves to anarchy."
royalist.9.a: "Unfortunate."

royalist.10.t: "Less White Terror activities"
royalist.10.d: "The increasing amount of White Terror activities has been slowly declining lately. The efforts of the army and police to restore order are having effect. Not everyone has calmed down however, and the fights may flare up again. But for now, the country is a bit more stable."
royalist.10.a: "Good."

royalist.11.t: "White Terror leads to anarchy"
royalist.11.d: "The government stance on White Terror activities has allowed lawlessness to grow. The streets in our cities are roamed by armed militias and every day citizens, of which many are probably innocent, are put to death. Anarchy has broken out in Romania, and the state is increasingly weak."
royalist.11.a: "This has to end."

royalist.12.t: "Protests against the army"
royalist.12.d: "The government stance on White Terror activities has led to protests from large groups of people. They do not want the army to protect all citizens, many of which they suspect are Iron Guard supporters. The army patrols in the streets and barricades of important buildings have been largely effective against most mobs. Still, they might not hold if they become target of an attack by an armed militia."
royalist.12.a: "Order the army back to the barracks."
royalist.12.b: "Arrest some well-know collaborators to appease them."
royalist.12.c: "Plunder and murder are not civilized!"

royalist.13.t: "Nightly plundering of Legionnaire shops"
royalist.13.d: "In many cities tonight shops of know Iron Guard collaborators were raided. Large mobs took to the streets, and with no police or army in sight began mass plundering. When the authorities failed to respond, several houses were set on fire. Several shopholders have asked the government to protect them. Even though they say they had nothing to do with the Iron Guard, they fear that the plundering will spiral out of control and also hit loyalist houses."
royalist.13.a: "Protect the shops."
royalist.13.b: "Turn a blind eye."

royalist.14.t: "White Terror: People killed in Bucharest"
royalist.14.d: "A large and possibly armed group of people have lynched several others in Bucharest today. Announcing that they were rounding up some anti-Royalist figures, they went from house to house to search for hidden collaborators, triumphantly dragging several out of their hiding holes. Afterwards they were brought to a local square and summarily executed.\n\nAccording to local media, the sight was not pretty."
royalist.14.a: "Unfortunate."

royalist.15.t: "White Terror: People killed in Iasi"
royalist.15.d: "A large and possibly armed group of people have lynched several others in Iasi today. Announcing that they were rounding up some anti-Royalist figures, they went from house to house to search for hidden collaborators, triumphantly dragging several out of their hiding holes. Afterwards they were brought to a local square and summarily executed.\n\nAccording to local media, the sight was not pretty."
royalist.15.a: "Unfortunate."

royalist.16.t: "You should not see this"
royalist.16.d: "If you see this, file a bug report."
royalist.16.a: "OK"

royalist.17.t: "The White Terror comes to [white_terror_state.GetName]"
royalist.17.d: "[white_terror_state.GetName] was relatively quiet until now, but today several people were 'arrested' by people militias in multiple towns. They were quickly tried and some were summarily executed, with their houses plundered by their neighbours. It seems that the White Terror has finally arrived in [white_terror_state.GetName]."
royalist.17.a: "Unfortunate."

royalist.18.t: "Angry mob threatens to storm internment camp"
royalist.18.d: "One of the larger internment camps in Bucharest has been surrounded by an angry mob, who demand that several people who they say were part of the Death Squads should be extradited and tried. The local police commander has quickly called for army support to protect the people in the camp.\n\nWhat should we do?"
royalist.18.a: "Order the army to shoot at the crowd."
royalist.18.b: "Deliver the persons they ask for."
royalist.18.c: "Order the army and police to stand down."

royalist.19.t: "First Elections"
royalist.19.desc_chaos: "The first free elections since the Weltkrieg are finally here. In some cities voters are lining up to fullfill their democratic duty, but the continuing chaos and anarchy stemming from the White Terror has led to many people staying at home. The grim reality of police and military patrolling the streets is not the feast of democracy the different parties had imagined.\n\nOnly the two major parties have the expectation of becoming the largest party, and the race is very close. But it remains to be seen how legitimate the results will be."
royalist.19.desc_no_chaos: "The first free elections since the Weltkrieg are finally here. Thousands of voters are lining up to fullfill their democratic duty. Despite fears that the White Terror would prevent people from voting, the streets have been relatively calm today and police only reported a few minor incidents.\n\nOnly the two major parties have the expectation of becoming the largest party, and the race is very close..."

royalist.25.t: "A new Constitution"
royalist.25.d: "The government currently debates whether to change the constitution. The current constitution is conservative, but a little authoritarian. Liberals demand to change it so it would be more democratic. Shall we change it?"

However, the local government is against the plan, which will involve large-scale demolition of the area, including a large forest.\n\nThe Interior minister has the power to overrule the local government, though this will certainly not be a popular decision in that area."
royalist.204.a: "We need a larger industry!"
royalist.204.b: "It is not worth it."

royalist.205.t: "New Factory Built"
