### Descriptions ###

POLITICS_PIO_DESC: "Padre Pio is many things, a Priest, a Friar, a Soldier, a Leader, a Mystic. Above all else, A servant of the Lord and His Church. Born to a devout peasant family in Southern Italy, Francesco Forgione decided from a young age to devote his life to God. Upon joining the Order of Friars Minor at the age of 15, Forgione took the name Pio. With the entry of Italy into the Weltkrieg, the now ordained Padre Pio was drafted into the Medical Corps. As Italy collapsed, he returned to his community, just in time for syndicalist insurgents to sack his monastery and kill four of his brothers. Shortly after, stigmata wounds appeared on his hands. It was then that Padre Pio learned of God’s plan for him. Joining an anti-syndicalist militia as Chaplain, his resolve quickly took him to the position of Commander. With God guiding his destiny, Pio has become the most powerful man in the NeoSanfedisti. No amount of suffering will stop Padre Pio from reviving the Church to truly embrace Christ’s message of Purity and Unity."

POLITICS_ZIGGI_DESC: "Renato Ziggiotti has not always been a priest, he has not always been a solider, but for the past twenty years he has done almost nothing but fight, trying to free the people of Italy from the socialist menace. Born October 9, 1892 in Campodoro, Ziggiotti lived a fairly normal childhood, entering the Salesian Novitiateon on September 15, 1909. However, the Weltkrieg would shatter his attempt to live as a simple religious, as he along with many of his brothers would be enlisted in the Italian army, first seeing combat in June 1915. Ziggiotti would do fairly well in the army, up until he was shot in the arm in 1917, knocking him out of the fight. In his time in recovery, he would study theology, and first feel his call to the priesthood. When he was eventually discharged from hospital he would be sent back to the collapsing Austrian front. Before he could get to the front, Austria was rapidly approaching Rome, leading to the capitulation of Italy. Ziggiotti as with thousands of other soldiers expected this to be the end of the war but in fact it was only the beginning. As a coalition of Nationalists and Socialists rose up in defiance to Austria and it's newly created Italian Federation, Ziggiotti would find himself leading a group of men against these rebels. As Austrian and Federal troops began to crush the so-called Italian Republic, the Socialist half of the Republic fled to the South, leaving the nationalists for dead. Ziggiotti, now a Captain , and his men were one of the first units sent to the south. Ziggiotti fought hard, but just like the thousands of other men sent to the South they were unable to dislodge the socialists. That was until the Cardinal Archbishop of Naples, Alessio Ascalesi issued a call to arms. Despite just arriving in the south, the SRI had already begun to commit horrendous crimes against the Church and her clergy. The Cardinal had been imprisoned just before he called on all faithful Catholics of Italy to form a New Army of Holy Faith, a NeoSanfedisti. Ziggiotti (along a few other units) heard this call and took action. Crossing the border, these units would form the professional backbone of the NeoSanfedisti. The first major action of the NeoSanfedisit was the saving of Cardinal Ascalesi. In reward of this, Cardinal Ascalesi  would ordain Ziggiotti after hearing of his desire to become a priest. Since that day, Padre Ziggiotti has become the defacto leader of the NeoSanfedisti, being the one to propose the idea of the Leadership Council. Now that he has been elected to truly lead them, Ziggiotti will do whatever it takes to create a truly holy Italy."

POLITICS_CATHOLIC_ISIS_DESC: "The Leadership Council of the NeoSanfedisti is less a formal military high command and more a way to keep the disparaging militias of the Army of Holy Faith from attacking each other as much as they do the Socialist Republic of Italy. Formed to unite the various militias of the Faithful who rose in response to the SRI pushing to the south, it cannot be said that the Leadership Council has not done it's job. Prior to the Leadership Council's creation, it was not uncommon to see fellow Catholics attacking one another over trivial issues. With the NeoSanfedisti coming on top of the SRI once and for all, these issues are once again bubbling to surface, and it is likely that the Leadership Council will finally be dissolved once it's hold over the south is consolidated."

POLITICS_PIO_LEO_DESC: "Padre Pio is many things, a Priest, a Friar, a, Soldier, a Leader, a Mystic. Above all else, A servant of the Lord and His Church.

No amount of suffering will stop Padre Pio from reviving the Church to truly embrace Christ’s message of Purity and Unity.\nWith the NeoSanfedisti uniting Italy and the previous Pontiff naming Pio his direct successor, Padre Pio is no longer a simple priest, but the earthly head of the Catholic Church! Upon becoming the Roman Pontiff, Pio took the name Leo, the fourteenth pontiff of that name, after Saint Leo the Great, the great defender of orthodoxy. Many within the Church and beyond interpret Pio's papal name to mean the the Papacy will be taking a hard traditionalist bent in the coming years."

Many within the Church and beyond interpret Pio's papal name to mean the the Papacy will be taking a more moderate approach to running the Church, many also expect that His Holiness will focus and encourage missionary activity, to bring the gospel to all nations."

Many within the Church and beyond interpret Pio's papal name to mean the the Papacy will be taking a radical step into reforming the Church to fit his vision of a pure and united world"

POLITICS_RICCARDO_LOMBARDI_DESC: "Born in Regalbuto, Sicily, on August 16th 1901, Riccardo Lombardi lived in the region long before the Socialist takeover. However, he does identify himself with that government. Specifically, he considers himself a part of the Christian-Socialist faction within the S.R.I., the Fasci. This does not mean he has always been this way; Lombardi and close friend Guido Mignoli hopped from party to party until hedging their bets with the Socialists, and have now founded their own faction in the form of the Fasci. His ideology can be described in many ways, and his recent popularity is probably best explained by the fact that his supporters can project their beliefs onto him. Syndicalists, Socialists, Communists, and even some Liberals who identify with the Crocean faction can identify with the man, and this combined with his political talent has made him a formidable force within Italy. With this support, he has sharply criticized the government's inability to provide for it's people, drawing on a combination of populist, religious, and socialist rhetoric to energize his supporters, who come from every walk of life. Now that he has taken power, he hopes to move forward with his agenda of Christian-Socialism, providing for his people and dealing with his enemies in the Mafia and elsewhere. One of the largest threats to Lombardi's power will certainly come from Julius Evola, who has been a rival to Lombardi for years and whom Lombardi has energetically opposed. The two mostly recently clashed when Lombardi and his men defended a socialist newspaper hub from Evola's men, and only time can tell what the outcome of this rivalry will be. One thing is clear though: with Lombardi in charge of the Socialist Republic of Italy, its people know their interests will be represented at last, and the country will prosper because of it."

POLITICS_TOGLIATTI_DESC: "Palmiro Tolgatti was born in Genoa in 1893 to a well-off middle-class family, his father was an accountant and his mother was a teacher. In 1911 Tolgatti's Father passed away from Cancer which led to his family falling into poverty, Tolgatti would join the Italian Socialist Party around this time too. After graduating from the University of Turin in 1917, Tolgatti served as a Volunteer army officer in the Weltkrieg but he was wounded in action and sent home to heal. During the breakdown of order in the 1920s in Italy, he was able to gather enough supporters to aid in the socialist rebellion that was taking Italy by storm at the time, although they were pushed south by Austria, Tolgatti had helped secure the independence of the Socialist Republic of Italy. Tolgatti has been sworn in as the second Chairman of the Socialist Republic and began to enact sweeping reforms across the agrarian areas that they control, he has also been accused of rigging the elections or strongarming the government to stay in power, Tolgatti has denounced these claims however. Chairman Palmiro Tolgatti is one of the most powerful men in the Italian Peninsula, time will only tell if he can keep that power."

POLITICS_VITTORIO_DESC: "Born in Apulia, Cerignola, into a family of poor agricultural laborers in 1892, Di Vittorio became an active socialist at a young age. Joining socialist youth movements at the age of 15 he quickly used his charisma and work ethic to move up from ranks. Joining the May 1904 general strike, during which several workers were killed, Di Vittorio witnessed first hand the inequalities suffered by the working class. Inspired by the Fasci Siciliani in the late 19th century, he became an anarcho-syndicalist union leader who galvanised the masses. Supporting militarism and intervenism, he held nationalist views like his close comrades, De Ambris and Mussolini. When the Weltkrieg came to an end and Italy faced a humiliating defeat, Di Vittorio was one of the leading instigators of the revolution. After the revolutionaries were pushed south by a Central Powers intervention, he used his charisma to rally the syndicalist militias who entrenched themselves preventing a complete collapse of the revolution. Now first Chairman of the Socialist Republic, Di Vittorio is eager to reclaim the rest of the Italian peninsula, and secure Italy’s place in the world!"

POLITICS_LABRIOLA_DESC: "Born in Naples on 21 January 1872, Arturo Labriola began his political activities at a young age. Joining the Republican-Socialists in 1891 he moved on to join the most influential movement of his life, the Fasci Siciliani Arising from the poor living conditions of rural peasants in Sicily this movement directly appealed to Labriola who was a strong adherent to democratic socialism. Labriola was an active member and would later serve as an organiser of several strikes in Milan. After brutal repressions against the strikes he fled into exile, living in Paris he worked with Georges Sorel who’s nationalist rhetoric would influence his later views. Returning to Italy he took part in the popular syndicalist movement and also lent his support to the pro-war interventionists.\n\n With the collapse of the Italian Front and outbreak of the revolution, Labriola eagerly took part in the newly formed Socialist Republic, when the S.R.I was pushed south by the Austrian-German intervention he too joined the fleeing government. However his support for syndicalism and the S.R.I would not last long, leaving the Unione Sindacalista after coming into disagreement with Chairman Di Vittorio. He then joined the Unione Socialista Cristiana, finding similarities between their devotion to Christ and agrarian socialist stances to the Fasci Siciliani. However now seeing the bureaucratic and militaristic S.R.I regime as betraying the working class he founded his own movement, based on the Fasci Siciliani. The Fascio Italiano dei lavoratori has found popularity amongst the peasantry with his ideology of Fascism providing hope to the poorest of Italy..\n\n When the Naples collapse broke out he used his new found popularity to rally the workers in defence against the invasive reactionary forces, now in control of Southern Italy he hopes to rebuild the region as a democratic and socialist land that can reunite their northern comrades..."

POLITICS_CALOGERO_VIZZINI_DESC: "Few criminals in the world have ever reached such renown status as Calogero Vizzini. His operations in Sicily being enough to topple a standing government and put Southern Italy under the control of a ruthless crime syndicate. Yet, despite Calogero Vizzini infamous status within the Mafia, he carries himself as a gentleman who only resorts to violence when he needs to and respects the people under his care. To some, he is a man if honour, to others he is a ruthless boss. But regardless, his power over the South is large, and the power of the Mafia over his fiefdom is nearly absolute. The South is governed by crime, even if Vizzini can conduct his operations in a somewhat legal matter. "

POLITICS_FERDINANDO_DESC: "Ferdinand of Bourbon-Two Sicilies' last 20 years have been troubled, as the relative tranquility of exile he lived in since his birth in 1869 was replaced with the responsibilities of being a monarch of a sovereign nation and the leader of the Italian Federation, at least in an interim fashion. Having arrived well after the civil war in Italy was concluded, his position was always fragile, and he himself knows he is little more than a puppet in the great game of Sicilian, Italian and global politics at large, as his presence legitimizes the Kingdom internationally and allows it to remain aligned with the powers that be in Europe, having effectively kept large scale syndicalist offensives at bay. His rule, while not without political issues, came after 6 years of war and strife, and he tries his utmost to ensure that he takes personal credit for this peace and relative prosperity. While he traditionally has kept himself away from political affairs, as he is aware of the fragility of the peace he and many work to mantain, the matter of the constant syndicalist threat, especially towards His Holiness in Rome, and his lack of a male heir, weigh heavily on him. The creeping feeling of powerlessness, even now as he is a monarch, makes him more prone to overtures by radical monarchists than even he himself realizes."
POLITICS_JULIUS_EVOLA_DESC: "Baron Julius Evola is one of the most controversial political philosophers in Europe and, perhaps, the world. Devoting himself to an ideology that has been named "Radical Traditionalism", "Legionarism" and "Ultra-Rightism", Evola believes that modern society is in the age that Hinduism refers to as "Kali Yuga", or an age of darkess and choas. Admiring warrior-societies such as the Teutonic Knights, Roman Empire and Ancient Sparta, Evola claims that there is a Western tradition that must be revived to stand against the consumerism found in both capitalism and socialism. As such he is a fierce spiritualist and anti-materialist whom advocates forms of asceticism, holds the current Catholic Church in contempt for meekness and holds supernatural beliefs. His views would have stayed fringe had foreign powers not both passively propped up the unpopular Bourbon dynasty and exiled the House of Savoy, Evola's utter denunciation of which has won him support among nobles in exile including, apparently, the former King of Italy himself, whom Evola ultimately seeks to make the supreme power of the state."

POLITICS_VICTOR_EMMANUEL_III_DESC: "The Former King of Italy and Head of the main branch of the House of Savoy has returned from his long exile to find an army of fanatical monarchists at his disposal. He is utterly an admirer of Julius Evola, now his High Chancellor, for making the seemingly impossible come true and bringing to life his aspirations. It helps that the King is also known to harbor reactionary beliefs which grow increasingly right-wing with Evola at his side and the Socialist enemy in the north. He hopes that he and Legion can accomplish the seemingly impossible and defeat the traditional enemies to his power, the republicans, the socialists and the Catholic Church."

SRI_end_anticatholicism: "Ending Anti-Catholicism"
SRI_end_anticatholicism_desc: "Despite our coming to power, many Anti-Catholic laws remain on the books and many churches and monasteries are still officially the property of the state. With good Catholic government finally returned to the south, it is time to do away with this state of affairs."
SRI_end_syndies: "An End to Red Italy"
SRI_end_syndies_desc: "With a truly Just government finally in power, the time has come to do away with the legacy of Red Italy.

When the world sees the Socialist Republic for what it truly was, Red Italy will finally and truly be at an end."
SRI_a_tighter_hold: "A Tight Grasp"
SRI_a_tighter_hold_desc: "As we begin to solidify our hold over the former Socialist Republic, it is necessary for our own survival that we hold the reigns of power tightly. Although some may protest, in order to ensure that Italy is never again threatened by the secular and socialist menace, we must have a tight grasp over the people."
SRI_future_of_italy: "The Future of the NeoSanfedisti"
SRI_future_of_italy_desc: "With our hold over Southern Italy now firm, a great debate has begun to rage about the future of the NeoSanfedisti. Although it seems everyone has an idea for the future of the south, everything from restoring the monarchy to the creation of theocracy. However only two men and their visions have any hope of being passed. These two men are Padre Pio and Padre Ziggiotti. Both have their plans and followers, but only one can come out on top..."
SRI_Ziggiottis_Plan: "Ziggiotti's Plan"
SRI_Ziggiottis_Plan_desc: "Ziggiotti's Plan, unlike the radical reforms of Pio is simple. Padre Ziggiotti's grand scheme is to make some minor reforms, mostly in the way of land for the peons. Once the Land Reform is complete, he will use the South's piety to unite with the North into a truly Holy Italia"
SRI_meaningful_land_reform: "Meaningful Land Reform"
SRI_meaningful_land_reform_desc: "Perhaps the one good thing about the Socialist Republic was the promise of land reform. Although never getting passed words on a page, the idea of land reform is something almost all the people of the South wanted. The time has come to enact this. Instead of just making promises, we shall truly go about reforming the ownership of land, with charity and justice in mind."
SRI_return_of_nobilty: "Return of the Nobilty"
SRI_return_of_nobilty_desc: "With land reform well under way, the time has come for the Nobles of the South, long in exile, to return home.

After all, a debtor must pay all his debts."

SRI_hope_of_faith_desc: "Although the south of Italy is famously rural and religious, with the neigh decade rule of the Socialists, this pious land has begun to shift away from the Faith, either becoming lukewarm or completely rejecting the faith. The effects of this can already be felt. In those who are walking away from the Faith, depression or worse, is rampant. In order to help these men and women of God's flock, we must begun to bring the hope and joy that comes with the Faith back into their lives."
SRI_light_of_reason: "The Light of Reason"
SRI_light_of_reason_desc: "Despite what Socialists, Secularists and other opponents of the Church claim, the Catholic Church is not some bulwark against science and reason. After all, it was the Church who build most of the great universities of Europe. While some claim that encouraging the people to be faithful Catholics and at same time funding the sciences is a contradiction, we say otherwise! Along with our program of bringing the Faith back to a land long devoid of it, we shall also increase research funding. After all, understanding God's creation is one of man's greatest abilities."
SRI_light_hand: "A Light Hand"
SRI_light_hand_desc: "As we are rebuilding the south, we have begun to encounter those still loyal to the revolution and those who fear us due to propaganda from the SRI. Both of these groups fear we will bring the wrath of God upon them, however that is far from our intentions. Our Lord's message was one of mercy and justice. While some of the more... radical members of the SRI will not escape justice, we shall treat most with the mercy and love of Christ."
SRI_Aproch_North: "Approching the North"

SRI_economic_integeration: "Economic Integration"
SRI_economic_integeration_desc: "With Italy finally reunited after a near decade long separation, glaring issues have emerged about the state of the nation, most notably being the economies. Both the north and the south have developed radically different economies. While we have made major strives in de-syndicalizing the economy of the south, the sudden of merger with the north has brought chaos to both the northern and southern economies. In order to avoid an economic depression, one of the first acts of a united Italy must be to integrate and stabilize our economy."
SRI_a_better_federation: "A Better Federation"
SRI_a_better_federation_desc: "As the Italian people have once more been brought back to unity, we are already seeing the fruits of unity. However, we are also seeing the problems of the old Federation, namley squbbling nobles and lack of care for the Faithful. This will not do. In order to build a truly better federation, we must remind the nobles of their faith, we must remind them that they already have a small chance of salvation, let alone if they are cruel to the poor and needy under their care. As for the faithful masses, we must ensure that they are taken care of, in both body and soul. To do this, Padre Ziggiottis has charged the state with the creation of a basic welfare system, so that those who have lost everything can still stand on their feet. "
SRI_Holy_Italia: "Holy Italia"
SRI_Holy_Italia_desc: "We have done it! Italy stands united once more, but not under a secular government, not under a goverment of Godless socialists! No, Italy stands united as brothers and sisters in the thing common to all Italians, the Catholic Faith! Unlike the Federation of the past, the Holy Federation does not pretend to be a nation of faith, it truly is. Rome and Italy at large have been graced by the LORD to be a Holy Land like Jerusalem and Palastine, and atlast, she has a government that will treat her as such! Long Live the Holy Federation of Italy!"
SRI_the_others: "Those Who Still Fight"

SRI_deal_with_mafia: "Dealing with the Mafia"
SRI_deal_with_mafia_desc: "Between the two groups that threaten our rule, the Mafia is by far the least dangerous of the two. Owing to their nominal Catholicism, the crime families have been fairly peaceable with us. However, their pedaling of vices is aiding in the moral destruction of the south, so they will have to be dealt with. Although some within our government say the best way to deal with them is too ignore them and focus on reconstruction. After all, why would we need to waste men and bullets on them if when the people are once again moral they wouldn't turn to the vices offered by the Mafia in the first place?"
SRI_deal_evolaism: "Dealing with the Evolaites"
SRI_deal_evolaism_desc: "Julius Evola and his so-called 'Legion' are one of the most heinous groups to come into existence in history. If his rejection of Catholicism wasn't enough, he preaches a neo-paganism that would see the Church and all she built thrown into the dustbin of history. While some kind of compromise with the Mafia may be possible, no such thing can be reached with the Legion. All of the government is in agreement, Evola must be destroyed for the betterment of all mankind."
SRI_south_redeemed: "The South Redeemed"
SRI_south_redeemed_desc: "With the Mafia dealt with and Evola along with his Legion facing their Maker, the South is cleansed at last. No more with the Socialist oppress the Faithful, no longer will the Mafia sell vices uncontrolled to the Faithful and no longer will Evola threaten to bring an end to the last bastion of Christendom. The South is free, and the New Army of Holy Faith will keep it that way." 
SRI_Pios_Vision: "Pio's Vision"
SRI_Pios_Vision_desc: "Padre Pio's grand vision is not one bound to just Italy. The holy mystic's plan is much more grand then that. But before any rash action, Pio must test his ideas. Under Pio, Italy will changed from a nation of Class, Race and difference to a people united under one banner, that of the Catholic faith. No longer with the people be torn from their true calling. Death to the Nation, Long Life to the Church!"
SRI_no_mercy: "One People"
SRI_no_mercy_desc: "Under Padre Pio's vision, all people shall become one in the Lord. While southern Italy is definitely not a melting pot, those who are not Italian shall still be treated as all others citzens of the Apastolic Realm. While it may be painful for the people to accpect those they used to reject, these are just growing pains. Soon, the whole world will feel the embrace and warmth of brotherhood. In Christ, we are all one people"
SRI_catholic_means_universal: "Catholic Means Universal"
SRI_catholic_means_universal_desc: "One of the main focual points of Padre Pio's great vision is that all mankind must come together into one glorious fold, that fold being the Catholic Church. In order to do this, the Padre has issued a general decree that those in postions of power, be it in the armed forces, the clergy or in the political class who hold to nationalism and socialism are to be removed from power. They shall not be put to death, we are all God's childern afterall, but they cannot hold power, least they taint the minds of the people."
SRI_erase_nationalism: "Attacking Nationalism"
SRI_erase_nationalism_desc: "With those who support the idols of our day now removed from power, the time has come to make the first great blow against Nationalism. This first strike shall be twofold. Firstly, the nation be highly decentralized in all but the most critical matters. Secondly, the great statutes and national monuments that cloud the minds of the Faithful with thoughts of nation shall be removed and replaced by statutes and works to Our Lord and his most Holy Church. With the first strike made, Italy will finally be on it's way to true Salvation, which comes only from the bosom of Holy Mother Church."
SRI_God_sees_no_classes: "The Lord Sees No Classes"
SRI_God_sees_no_classes_desc: "Although the removal of nationalism and socialism in the minds of the people is the primary part of Pio's grand vision, it is not the only part. It is only one piece of the puzzle. The second, and perhaps most important piece, is what the great Padre has planned in regards to societal reorganization. With the state already being highly decentralized, the time has come to begin implementing Catholic Corporatism. In order to remove the ideas and distractions of Class from the mind of the people, ALL classes must work together, in one organic body. Classes shall begin to work together, until as such time as class itself can be completely erased. But until that time, we shall do all we can to lessen the impact class has."
SRI_blessed_are_the_poor: "Blessed Are the Poor"
SRI_blessed_are_the_poor_desc: "While the middle and upper class of the populous has so far begun to get used to working with one another as brothers and equals, the most numerous and worst off in our society, namely the Poor are still suffering greatly. This has caused great suffering for Padre Pio, who himself was raised in poverty. In order to solve the ever present problem of poverty, Padre Pio has ordered the creation of a network of soup kitchens, public housing and hospitals, to provide both aid to those who belong to the poor, but also to put the light and fire of Christ within their breast."  
SRI_The_Chair_of_Peter: "The Chair of Saint Peter"
SRI_The_Chair_of_Peter_desc: "With the south of Italy now beginning to finally breath free of the chains that bind man to Worldly things, Padre Pio's great vision has been proven that it can work! With this new-found success, the time has come to implement these plans and practices throughout the entire Catholic Church. The way to do that? A Church Council, as only a Council can generate enough buzz and hype to fully get Pio's reforms in practice. However, only the Bishop of Rome can call a Council. To this end, Padre Pio plans to meet with His Holiness, to discuss this very matter." 
SRI_peaceful_union: "The North Submits"
SRI_peaceful_union_desc: "Following a formal request for annexation by Pope-Elect Pio, the North has submitted. At long last, the decade long division of Italy shall come to an end, all that remains is to iron out the details, a thing that will take some time to complete."
SRI_march_north: "Marching North"
SRI_march_north_desc: "Betrayal! The Cardinals in control of the north have refused the Pope-Elect's most legitmate request of reunion! If this refusal is by their own accord or foreign interference matters not! The north has made it's choice and war will soon be the state of affairs between our two nations!"
SRI_papal_crowning: "Papal Investiture"
SRI_papal_crowning_desc: "With the Eternal City now in the hands of the Pope-Elect, the time has finally come. Padre Pio is to soon be invested as a Bishop, and then he shall take his place upon the Vacant Throne of Saint Peter, the Vicar of Christ and earthy head of the Holy Catholic Church."
SRI_Pios_Papacy: "Pio's Papacy"
SRI_Pios_Papacy_desc: "With his investiture complete, Padre Pio is now the Holy Father! While some preparations must be made, and Pio's papacy is still far from stable, the time is fast approaching for the Second Vatican Council, where the future of the Church and perhaps the entire world hangs in the balance..."
SRI_address_cardinals: "Address the Cardinals"
SRI_address_cardinals_desc: "The Scared College of Cardinals, perhaps the most powerful body of men in the Church(save for His Holiness of course) nominally whenever there is a period of Sede Vacant, they elect the next Roman Pontiff, but with Pio's direct appointment they were sidelined, and most of them still hold a grudge against the Pontiff for this. If we want the Second Vatican Council to do anything but be stonewalled and in order to avoid the election of a rival Bishop of Rome, the Cardinals must be addressed."
SRI_address_laity: "Address the Laity"
SRI_address_laity_desc: "The Catholic Laity, over the past few months, have been greatly scandalized by the sudden departure of the Holy Father and the direct appointment of the next. The whole so-called Italy stand off did not help things. If we to have the Second Vatican Council have any chance of sticking, the Laity must view Pio as the legitimate Pontiff. In order to do this, Pio shall tour Italy, giving speeches and praying the Mass, to win the Laity back to the side of Holy Mother Church."
SRI_preparing_the_council: "Preparing the Second Vatican Council"
SRI_preparing_the_council_desc: "With the issues and challenges presented by the Cardinals and Laity dealt with, the time has come to make formal preparations for the Second Vatican Council. They will take time, but a Council is truly the only way to get the Reforms of Pio beyond the borders of just Italy, so we must wait."
SRI_church_of_yesterday: "The Church of Yesterday"
SRI_church_of_yesterday_desc: "The way forward for the Church in this modern world is not some novel reforms. While Pio's vision may be grand and glorious, it is far too radical a change. However, this does not mean that moderation is the way forward either. Those who are lukewarm are spit out of Our Lord's mouth and thrown into the Pit. No, the way forward for the Church is too look back. What is it that made the Church great? Her Divine Founder, Jesus Christ and what He gave the Church. What Our Lord gave the Church, her most glorious traditions, her beloved saints, her most mysterious and holy rituals, rituals that are able to call God himself whole and entire into a tiny piece of bread! It is by looking at and embracing fully the treasures of Holy Tradition that the Church shall go forward in this modern age."
SRI_church_of_today: "The Church of Today"
SRI_church_of_today_desc: "The way forward for the Church in this modern world is not some novel reforms. While Pio's vision may be grand and glorious, it is far too radical a change. Neither is the way forward a radical return to tradition. No, the way forward is viva moderation, as it is in all cases. Some token reforms that the Pope has championed can surely be implemented, just as how several traditional reforms can also be undertaken. The Church shall not fall to extremism. She will instead take things on a case by case basis, to find the best solution for the entire Body of Christ. After all, it is the modern day. We shall learn from the past and hope for the future yes, but we shall not try to get to either, will simple sail the course that is in the middle of both"
SRI_church_of_tomorrow: "The Church of Tomorrow"
SRI_church_of_tomorrow_desc: "The way forward for the Church in this modern world is obvious. We must fully and completely embrace the Holy Father's vision of a world free of Nationalism and Socialism, one free of distractions from God. Only in this manner, will the Catholic Church be able to stay the force it rightfully is. While many scoff at this plan, we know that our way is true. After all, if they hate us, don't we know we are doing the right thing? As Our Lord said, if the World hates you, know that it hated Me first."
SRI_papal_authority: "Strengthen Papal Authority"
SRI_papal_authority_desc: "A large following of the traditionalist wing of the Council Fathers subscribe to the idea or theory of Ultramontanism, or in other words,a great strengthening of Papal Authority. They hold that only the Roman Pontiff should have any say in most if not all matters of the Church, in a word, they reject any autonomy for the bishops of any country. While we cannot completely do away with local autonomy of the bishops, we can greatly strengthen the position of the Bishop of Rome, to allow for an easier time in implementing our reforms." 
SRI_beauty_of_latin: "The Beauty of Latin"
SRI_beauty_of_latin_desc: "As part of our reforms to turn to the Church back to the age of her glories, a very exciting proposal has reached the floor of the Council. The proposal would have the Council decree that Latin is the sole language of the Church, and no the Mass may not be said in any other language, under punishment of Sin. Along with this however, the proposal will recommend that study groups be set up in every parish of the Church, to both help the Faithful understand Latin, but also to help them see the beauty of this most holy language."
SRI_decree_on_freemasonary: "Decree on Freemasonary?"
SRI_decree_on_freemasonary_desc: "Freemasonry has been condemned more then anything else in the history of the Roman Catholic Church due to several reasons, the main one being it's promotion of the heresy of Relativism. Despite this condemnations, the practice has yet to be formally condemned by a Council. Several of the Council Fathers seek to change this. A proposed decree that has been presented to the Council Fathers would see Freemasonry outlined and explained why it is seen as heretical, and why a Catholic cannot under any circumstances stance join such an origination. While the proposal is interesting, it still remains up to the Council Fathers if it will be promulgated or not." 
SRI_decree_on_protestantism: "Decree on Protestantism"
SRI_decree_on_protestantism_desc: "If any heretical force have shaped the course of the modern world more then anything, it would be the heresy of Protestantism. While the errors and heresy of Protestants are known wide and far, the Council Fathers view it as a necessary step to once more remind the world of the errors and dangers presented by Protestantism, in any form."
SRI_baptize_all_nations: "Baptize All Nations"
SRI_baptize_all_nations_desc: "The one major reform proposed by the moderate Council Fathers, and seemly the only major reform that will be passed in the Council, is one entitled 'Baptize all Nations.' The decree in essence, would turn the Church from teaching and guiding the world as if she had power of it, to one of a missionary, spreading the gospel to a world that knows it not. Along with this return to 'missionary mode' comes permission to say Holy Mass in the local language of the Faithful. This move is highly experimental, and many wonder if it will not come back to bite the Council in the end. Regardless, with the inevitable passage of the decree, the Catholic Church will once more be a missionary to the World." 
SRI_decree_on_socialism: "Decree on Socialism"
SRI_decree_on_socialism_desc: "Socialism is a repugnant ideology, there is no question about that fact, nor is that contested by any member of the Council Fathers, no matter how radical. While socialism has been condemned by Popes in the past, the time has come for a formal and unanimous decree against socialism and it's vile spawn."
SRI_decree_on_capitalism: "Decree on Capitalism?"
SRI_decree_on_capitalism_desc: "Of the many social issues that Catholic Social Teaching has touched on, none is less clear that that of capitalism. While unrestricted capitalism has been commended by many Popes in the past, none have gone that far with it, until today. A formal decree on the status of capitalism has come before the Council Fathers, and it may just change the future of Catholic Social Teaching forever..."
SRI_decree_on_nationalism: "Decree on Nationalism"
SRI_decree_on_nationalism_desc: "In order to fully embrace the Holy Father's great vision, we must make it clear to all men and women who belong to the Catholic Faithful:Nationalism is not an ideology one can follow or embrace. Yes, love of country and patriotism is a virtue, but it must go not further. Love of one's country is a good thing! But the idolizing of nation? Hating those who do not belong to one's own nation? No, these are ideas are unchristian and sinful. To this end, a decree on nationalism shall be presented to the Second Vatican Council, so that we can at last make the Catholic position of nationalism known to all, Faithful or otherwise."
SRI_new_crusader_era: "New Crusader Era"
SRI_new_crusader_era_desc: "A large part of the Holy Father's plan is the complete unity of mankind, in one family and body. To do this, the earth must fall under the complete control of the Roman Catholic Church, and to do that, you need the sword. What better way to both model our coming battles then after those most Holy of Wars, the Crusades? It is with and solely by a New Crusader Era that the Pope's vision of a united world can come to reality."

SRI_knights_of_the_grail: "Knights of the Grail"
SRI_knights_of_the_grail_desc: "In order to carry out our goals we will need more than loosely organized militias. The Knights of the Grail, named for adventures whom went on that ancient journey, is a highly-esteemed society made up of our most loyal militants armed with our best equipment so that they may answer directly to the Soveriegn without question and cast his enemies into darkness forever."

SRI_destroy_liberalism_desc: "At long last we can do away with that system which has made man decadent, weak and pampered.

SRI_integralist_complaceny: "Integralist Complacency"

SRI_anti_clericalism: "Anti-Clericalism"
SRI_anti_clericalism_desc: "For too long the catholic priests have prevented the centralization of power under the monarch in favor of giving spiritual authority to a Papacy that preaches a modernist slave morality. While the transition out of traditional Catholicism will not be easy a good start would be anti-clericalism that cloaks the issue of the Pope's influence in just as nationalist terms than Spiritual ones."
SRI_hit_papacy: "The Vatican is Vulnerable"
SRI_hit_papacy_desc: "Even with socialists to the North and their cause discredited the Papal States continues to play their power games, proving they will always aid themselves to the cost of true leadership.

SRI_ghibelline_revival: "Ghibelline Revival"
SRI_ghibelline_revival_desc: "Against the Mercantilist Guelphs the Ghibelline understood that spiritual power should rest with the Emperor alone. Their loss helped usher in the fall of man from rule by the Nobles to Mercantilists so we must revive their legacy.

SRI_legionary_order_desc: "It is time to establish an official political class based on the values that should that be rewarded; vitality, traditionalism, strength and loyalty.

SRI_heroic_idealism: "Heroic Idealism"
SRI_heroic_idealism_desc: "It is through heroic experiences that we not only create men but super-men whom display the best of their nation and find themselves in war, until the act becomes holy itself.

SRI_ascetic_values: "Ascetic Values"
SRI_ascetic_values_desc: "Modernism has chained the species to material wants, the lowest of desires.

SRI_blood_and_spirit: "Blood and Spirit"

#SRI_sardinias_final_offer: "Sardinia's Final Offer"
#SRI_sardinias_final_offer_desc: "Sardinia rightfully belongs to the House of Savoy and while Amadeo's stance against the socialists is admirable it is not his place to dispute Emmanuel's claim.

SRI_iron_guard_alliance: "Our Fellow Legion"
SRI_iron_guard_alliance_desc: "There is a Legion of Warriors whom have also come to reject modernity in favor of a national-mysticism that allows men to come into contact with the very soul of their nation.

SRI_strike_consumerism: "Strike Consumerism"
SRI_strike_consumerism_desc: "The liberal capitalists and business owners continue to peddle consumerist and materialist nonsense to our nation, weakening their spirit in favor of hedonism. We will take the business' that sell frivolous wares and enrich internationalist bankers, thus allowing the King to either distribute it among nobles or put it towards more productive tasks."
SRI_magical_societies: "Occult Societies"
SRI_magical_societies_desc: "Despite as predicted it having lower acceptance among the masses our newly established ruling class has come to embrace Evola's religious beliefs far more comfortably than the alternatives offered by Catholicism and atheism. Occult societies will encourage brotherhood, faith and cooperation between the Order and their admirers and accelate our society toward containing at its core an esoteric soul."
SRI_constrained_science: "Science Constrained"
SRI_constrained_science_desc: "It is no surprise that the vacuous modernist values sciences study of the material world over spiritual exploration. Technology and studies that encourage decadence will end with all such remaining resources being cenralized by the state and put only towards the practical matter of fighting off the allies of decadence."
SRI_spiritual_casteism: "Spiritual Casteism"
SRI_spiritual_casteism_desc: "At long last the King and our Warrior-Nobility have established total dominance. We must now recognize our internal nations, or castes, so that each individual may live up to their full potential as they were intended to.

SRI_sovereign_beyond_state: "Sovereign Beyond State"
SRI_sovereign_beyond_state_desc: "At long last we have a sovereign whom can officially be beyond the laws of man, whose word should be the final one in all legal and spiritual matters and whom is as close to the higher powers that be than any of us can hope to be. Even our Warrior-Nobility must understand that he embodies Tradition and is to be worshipped as such."
SRI_the_west: "The West"
SRI_the_west_desc: "Western Europe was once the domain of the greatest empire to live followed by feudal societies that celebrated noble virtue. Now it is decimated by socialism and Papal influence. We must retake Gaul and Hispania and bring them back to their rightful place."

SRI_restore_the_old_world_desc: "Little has been more difficult to witness than the greatness of Austria and Greece, once the bastions of the Holy Roman and Macedonian Empires respectively and in the case of the latter Sparta, being degenerated by liberalism and modernism.

### Events ###
socitaly.1.t: "The Socialist Republic of Italy"
socitaly.1.d: "With the defeat of France and then the fall of Rome 6 months later,\nan exhausted Italy was left at the mercy of the Central Powers, seemingly destined to be reorganized into her old pre-unification states within an Italian Federation. Just months after the humiliating announcement, enraged socialists and nationalists proclaimed a new Republic of Italy in Torino, and that all treaties signed by the House of Savoy were to be considered null and void. However, not so far away in Roma, Federal militias mobilised. Austria's plans for a united Italian subject were quickly torn to pieces.\n\nAs civil war erupted, the Italian Federation gained seemingly unstoppable momentum, with utter defeat almost certain, the socialist leaders left the nationalists to die, and managed an invasion into Naples with whatever army we had left. With the historical region of Socialist Republic of Italy under the control of the workers, and the French Commune backing us, we were left in a period of deadlock. Which eventually led to ceasefire when the Austrians pulled out.\n\nAfter a ceasefire was declared in 1922, Three Congresses have come and gone, and revolutionary fervor has begun to change the minds of the peasantry. Of course, there are some that would ruin our progress, but they could never be able to take control? Right?"
socitaly.1.a: "Forward!"

socitaly.200.t: "Uniting Italy"
socitaly.200.d: "Italian nationalists have already begun the call for a Second Risorgimento, to unify Italia once more. Spreading the revolution will not be a simple matter, however. The peninsula exists in an uneasy balance: Germany and Austria are wary of any formal alliance between the SRI and the Third Internationale. They know an alliance is inevitable, but any attempt on our part to bring the French and English into a war to reunite Italy under syndicalist rule would draw intervention and start a new Weltkrieg. The Federation in the north is protected by Austria, but under a similar prohibition against starting a war against us. So long as the prospect of German and Austrian interference remains, we must be aware that any war to reunite Italy can only be done with limited Third Internationale support. We have not made a move yet, but we cannot sit idly for much longer - Italy must be reunited!"
socitaly.200.a: "Viva l'Italia!"

### Fourth Congress ###
socitaly.2.t: "Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union"
socitaly.2.d: "Today, the Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union begins. The various factions of the Congress will debate economic, internal, and military policies. The Unione Sindacalista seek to push Orthodox Syndicalism, advancing the current policies of the congress, while the Unione Socialista Cristiana desire a government that helps the people, and supporting Christian socialism. Meanwhile, Benito Mussolini's new faction, the Unione Nazionalista, advances the new ideology of Garibaldismo, advocating for absolute state power and aggressive military expansion. The very future of the Republic hangs in the balance."
socitaly.2.a: "Let's get to work!"

socitaly.3.t: "Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union - Economic Policy"
socitaly.3.d: "The first order of business is the economic policy of the Republic. The Unione Socialista Cristiana advocate for a focus on agrarianism and supporting the rural communes. The Unione Sindacalista argue for furthering syndicalism to be a proper industrial democratic republic. While Mussolini's Unione Nazionalista demand nothing short of total and immediate industrialisation."
socitaly.3.a: "We must expand our agriculture."
socitaly.3.b: "We should focus on industrialisation."
socitaly.3.c: "Nothing short of total industrialisation will suffice!"

socitaly.4.t: "Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union - Internal Policy"
socitaly.4.d: "The discussion on the second day of the Congress focused on more internal matters. The Unione Sindacalista's representative came forward and pushed for further empowerment of the unions while the Unione Socialista Cristiana's representative came forward and pushed for empowering the rural communes instead. Unione Nazionalista's representative argued that it is the chairman that should be empowered."
socitaly.4.a: "Focus on empowering the Communes."
socitaly.4.b: "Focus on empowering the Unions."
socitaly.4.c: "Focus on Empowering the Chairman."

socitaly.5.t: "Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union - Religious Policy"
socitaly.5.d: "The final order of business is the status of Christianity within the republic. The Unione Socialista Cristiana has come out strongly supporting Christian Socialism, their representative claiming that even priests can serve socialism as Jesus wanted. The Unione Nazionalista, on the other hand, are claiming that Christianity is archaic, unsuited for the modern age and that State Atheism will help break the chains of ignorance. Finally, the Unione Sindacalista are supporting a middle ground status quo of secularism."
socitaly.5.a: "Support Christian Socialism."
socitaly.5.b: "Support Secularism."
socitaly.5.c: "Support State Atheism."

socitaly.6.t: "Unione Socialista Cristiana Majority!"
socitaly.6.d: "The Unione Socialista Cristiana has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. Now two leading members of the faction can assume the role of Chairman, Giacomo Matteotti or Giuseppe Romita. Whom shall be elected the new Chairman?"
socitaly.6.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Matteotti!"
socitaly.6.b: "Congratulations, Comrade Romita!"

socitaly.7.t: "Unione Sindacalista Majority!"
socitaly.7.d: "The Unione Sindacalista has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. Now, along with Chairman Di Vittorio remaining in power, two other leading members of the faction could assume the role of Chairman, Palmiro Togliatti or Alceste De Ambris. Whom shall be elected the new Chairman?"
socitaly.7.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Di Vittorio!"
socitaly.7.b: "Congratulations, Comrade De Ambris!"
socitaly.7.c: "Congratulations, Comrade Togliatti!"

socitaly.8.t: "Unione Nazionalista Majority!"
socitaly.8.d: "The Unione Nazionalista has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. With this victory, Benito Mussolini is now the new chairman."
socitaly.8.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Mussolini!"

socitaly.9.t: "No Majority Achieved!"
socitaly.9.d: "No faction of the Congress came out on top. The government is deadlocked, and for now, the country is once again thrown into chaos while the leaders attempt to negotiate some kind of compromise."
socitaly.9.a: "Damn it!"

socitaly.10.t: "Unione Sindacalista and Unione Socialista Cristiana Compromise"
socitaly.10.d: "In an effort to block the dangerous Unione Nazionalista from achieving any kind of power, the Unione Sindacalista and Unione Socialista Cristiana have agreed to form a coalition government. Chairman Di Vittorio maintains his role as president, while Giacomo Matteotti becomes the new Chairman of the Congress of People's Unions."
socitaly.10.a: "Better than nothing."

socitaly.11.t: "Stalemate in the Socialist Republic of Italy"
socitaly.11.d: "During the recent Congress of the Socialist Republic of Union, none of the three factions achieved a clear majority. This would normally not be our concern, but the lack of compromise is further destabilizing an ally which is already unsteady on its feet. Perhaps we can help them choose their new government?"
socitaly.11.a: "Support the Unione Socialista Cristiana!"
socitaly.11.b: "Support the Unione Sindacalista!"
socitaly.11.c: "Support the Unione Nazionalista."
socitaly.11.e: "It's not our problem."

socitaly.16.t: "French Support the Unione Socialista Cristiana"
socitaly.16.d: "The French government has declared its support for the Unione Socialista Cristiana. Should we listen to their advice or should we try to find a solution on our own?"
socitaly.16.a: "The Unione Socialista Cristiana will be the new government!"
socitaly.16.b: "Let us try and find a compromise ourselves."

socitaly.17.t: "French Support the Unione Sindacalista"
socitaly.17.d: "The French government has declared its support for the Unione Sindacalista. Should we listen to their advice or should we try to find a solution on our own?"
socitaly.17.a: "The Unione Sindacalista will be the new government!"
socitaly.17.b: "Let us try and find a compromise ourselves."

socitaly.18.t: "French Support the Unione Nazionalista"
socitaly.18.d: "The French government has declared its support for the Unione Nazionalista. Should we listen to their advice or should we try to find a solution on our own?"
socitaly.18.a: "The Unione Nazionalista will be the new government!"
socitaly.18.b: "Let us try and find a compromise ourselves."

### NeoSanfedisti ###

socitaly.19.t: "Suppression of Catholics"
socitaly.19.d: "A number of highly-placed Catholics who have been deemed at risk for supporting the Papacy over their own government were recently rounded up by the Republican Guard today and placed in prison until such a time as they can be properly vetted. It's a move that's sure to outrage other Catholics in the republic, but should any trouble arise, the presence of so many ready informants will ensure it is dealt with readily."
socitaly.19.a: "It must be done, for the greater good"

socitaly.20.t: "Southern Catholics Suppressed"
socitaly.20.d.nosic: "In a move that comes as a confirmation to many of the evils of Syndicalism, the government recently rounded up scores of Catholic faithful – anyone whose allegiances might be suspect, and who might have been an ally to the Pope – and placed them in prison pending eventual interrogation. It's a move which has spurred resentment in the south, and renewed calls for war. There are those within the Pope's inner circle who suggest this also presents an opportunity: to use the outrage within [SRI.GetNameDef] and fund a resistance movement. While the possibility exists that [SRI.GetNameDef] could discover our connection and go to war with us, the resistance could significantly weaken them and afford us the ability to raise partisans behind enemy lines once the war begins."

While the possibility exists that [SRI.GetNameDef] could discover our connection and go to war with us, the resistance could significantly weaken them and afford us the ability to raise partisans behind enemy lines once the war begins. This would, of course, depend on whether we get the blessing of [SIC.GetNameDef], who would be forced to come to our rescue if such a war began."
socitaly.20.a: "We will fund the Neosanfedisti resistance!"
socitaly.20.b: "No, it is far too great a risk"

socitaly.21.t: "Southern Catholics Suppressed"
socitaly.21.d: "In a move that comes as a confirmation to many of the evils of Syndicalism, the government recently rounded up scores of Catholic faithful – anyone whose allegiances might be suspect, and who might have been an ally to the pope – and placed them in prison pending eventual interrogation.

socitaly.21.a: "These people are innocent of all but faith!"

socitaly.22.t: "The NeoSanfedisti"
socitaly.22.d: "The NeoSanfedisti - literally 'the new holy faithful men', named after an eighteenth-century Italian terrorist organisation - has begun attacking government installations all over the republic. Aiming to create as much havoc as they can in the name of the 'oppressed' Catholic Church, the NeoSanfedisti could tie up much of our resources if their actions continue."

socitaly.28.d: "During the night, a Republican Guard barracks in [attack_state.GetName] was attacked by the NeoSanfedisti, the bomb causing great loss of life and equipment. The Republican Guard has vowed revenge and plans to take the terrorists out and end this slaughter."
socitaly.28.a: "We will get them sooner or later..."

socitaly.29.t: "Ringleaders Apprehended!"
socitaly.29.d: "Earlier today, several of the ringleaders behind the NeoSanfedisti movement were apprehended by Republican Guard investigators. This is a serious blow to the Catholic terrorists, and brings the country one step closer to eliminating them for good."
socitaly.29.d.last: "Earlier today, the last of the ringleaders behind the NeoSanfedisti movement were apprehended by Republican Guard investigators. This puts an end to the group's operations within [SRI.GetNameDef], and an example will be made of the men to ensure that no other Catholic agitators get similar ideas in the future."
socitaly.29.a: "The sooner, the better!"
socitaly.29.b: "Finally!"

socitaly.30.t: "Foreign Support for the NeoSanfedisti"
socitaly.30.d: "While it comes as little surprise to some, we finally have acquired proof that [PAP.GetNameDef] has been directly funding the NeoSanfedisti terrorists. Many citizens of [SRI.GetNameDef], both within the Congress and the general public, cry out for vengeance, although some caution that we may not yet be ready for the war against the south."
socitaly.30.a: "To war with the reactionary terrorists!"
socitaly.30.b: "We must bid our time."

socitaly.31.t: "Pope Rallies the NeoSanfedisti"
socitaly.31.d: "The Pope has issued a call to the NeoSanfedisti faithful, and they have answered in large numbers, raising troops in Southern Italy behind our lines. Apparently they have been planning this for some time, and [ITA.GetNameDef] has been supplying them with training and equipment. It seems we did not find their ringleaders quickly enough."
socitaly.31.a: "It will make no difference"

socitaly.32.t: "Policy Towards the Church"
socitaly.32.d.radsoc: "While the policy of the Unione Socialista Cristiana is to work with the Church, our support of the Worker-Priest movement has created mixed reactions amongst the faithful. Some of them claim we are perverting the Christian faith towards an industrial cause, and question the use of scripture in motivating workers. There is a concern within the government that this resistance will only provide an opening for the Papacy to exploit once it comes time for war with the Mezzogiorno."
socitaly.32.d.synd: "While the policy of the Unione Sindacalista has been to ignore matters of faith, many within our government say our support of the Worker-Priest movement has violated our traditional neutrality. What's more, it's causing mixed reactions amongst the country's faithful. Some of them claim we are perverting the Christian faith towards an industrial cause, and question the use of scripture in motivating workers. There is a concern within the government that this resistance will only provide an opening for the Papacy to exploit once it comes time for war with the Mezzogiorno."
socitaly.32.a: "Come down hard on this resistance"
socitaly.32.b: "Ease back on our support - the movement should be voluntary"

socitaly.33.t: "Assessing the Economy"
socitaly.33.d: "The economy of the country has been suffering in recent years. While great progress has been made since the civil war that tore Italy apart, we must consider ways to improve the economy. Two main proposals have been put forth to the Congress. The first, favoured by the Unione Socialista Cristiana, would focus on decentralising our industry by empowering the various communes throughout the country. The second plan, put forth by the Unione Nazionalista, is nearly the exact opposite. It instead would favour creating an organisation called the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (Institute for Industrial Reconstruction) that will organise and guide the syndicates and unions in order to bring prosperity to Italy and its people."
socitaly.33.a: "Support the Communal Syndicalism plan"
socitaly.33.b: "Support the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale plan"

socitaly.34.t: "Reviewing the Guards"
socitaly.34.d: "The Red Guards, or Guardia Rosse, have been the backbone of the Socialist Republic of Italy's army since the civil war. Organised as local militias, they have major support among the local communes that field and equip them. However, with some nationalists seeking to reunify Italy, plans have been put forth to reform the Red Guards into a true Red Army. However, such a plan is controversial for many members of the Red Guards that are highly suspicious of a centralised military apparatus, despite the benefits that it will bring."
socitaly.34.a: "Support the Red Guards"
socitaly.34.b: "Create the Red Army!"

socitaly.35.t: "Military Research Focus"
socitaly.35.d: "With the Red Army now in place, it is time for the research committee to help better focus our efforts."
socitaly.35.a: "Focus on advanced electronic research"
socitaly.35.b: "Focus on furthering tank research"
socitaly.35.c: "Focus on rocketry and nuclear research"

socitaly.38.t: "Awarding Naval Contracts"
socitaly.38.d: "We have two union-owned and -operated shipyards which are vying for the government contracts. One, the Cantieri Navali Riuniti, specializes in smaller ships, while the other, the Cantieri Navali Livorno, specializes in capital ships. We will have to select where our focus lies."
socitaly.38.a: "Award it to the Cantieri Navali Riuniti"
socitaly.38.b: "Award it to the Cantieri Navali Livorno"

socitaly.40.t: "Italy is United!"
socitaly.40.d: "At long last, Italy has been reunited, and the revolution has spread to every corner of the peninsula! Today is a great day and shall be considered a national holiday. Let all Italians rejoice now that Italy is reunited!"
socitaly.40.a: "Viva l'Italia!"

socitaly.41.t: "Fifth Congress"
socitaly.41.d: "Today, the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Republic of Italy begins. Delegates from all the unions across Italy have convened for the Congress, which is the first to be held in Rome and in a united Italy. Celebrations are being held throughout the nation, and Rome in particular, in honour of this momentous event."
socitaly.41.a: "Let's get to work!"

socitaly.42.t: "The Fate of the Pope"
socitaly.42.d: "One of the first issues on the agenda is what is to be done with the Pope. The Unione Socialista Cristiana argue that the government has no business interfering with the Catholic Church, and that the Pope should be left alone. The Unione Sindacalista believe that the throne of Saint Peter's should be occupied by a socialist. Finally, the Unione Nazionalista argues that the office of the Papacy is outdated and the Pope should be exiled. What shall be the decision of the Congress?"
socitaly.42.a: "Leave the Church alone."
socitaly.42.b: "Install a Red Pope."
socitaly.42.c: "Exile the Pope from Italy."

socitaly.43.t: "Internal Policy"
socitaly.43.d: "The second matter on the Fifth Congress's agenda is how to handle the issue of dissidents in the Republic. Not all within the Republic are accepting socialism, particularly in the areas where the reactionaries held sway prior to the Second Risorgimento. The Unione Socialista Cristiana argues for a conciliatory policy, granting general amnesty and focusing on building socialism instead of going after the dissidents. The Unione Sindacalista believes that a propaganda effort to show socialism's progress, combined with a balanced approach to law enforcement, will help change the minds of the dissidents. The Unione Nazionalista, for their part, wants to empower the Ministry of Public Security to clamp down on any dissent against the republic. What shall the Congress decide?"
socitaly.43.a: "The dissidents are not a threat."
socitaly.43.b: "Increase the propaganda to support the Republic."
socitaly.43.c: "Arrest the dissidents and those who help them!"

socitaly.44.t: "Italy's Place on the World Stage"
socitaly.44.d: "The next order of the Congress is to decide on what role the Socialist Republic of Italy shall play within the International and on the world stage. Until the Second Risorgimento, the Republic was focused on reuniting Italy, but now that that goal has been achieved, Italy's political future must be determined. The Unione Nazionalista believe that Italy should focus on spreading the revolution to all corners of the world while the Unione Sindacalista believe the focus should be first on Europe. Finally, the Unione Socialista Cristiana believe Italy's role is to help nurture socialism within Italy and the members of the International first."
socitaly.44.a: "Nurture socialism from within"
socitaly.44.b: "A European revolution!"
socitaly.44.c: "A world revolution!"

socitaly.45.t: "Unione Socialista Cristiana Victory"
socitaly.45.d: "The Unione Socialista Cristiana has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. They must now determine who is to lead the country. Comrades Olindo Vernocchi, Gaetano Salvemini, Giuseppe Romita, and Giacomo Matteotti are the leading candidates to assume the role of Chairman. Who shall it be?"

socitaly.49.d: "In an effort to block the dangerous Unione Nazionalista from achieving any kind of power, the Unione Sindacalista and Unione Socialista Cristiana have agreed to form a coalition government. Alceste De Ambris will assume the role as president, while Giacomo Matteotti becomes the new Chairman of the Congress of People's Unions."

socitaly.50.d: "His Holiness has locked himself within the Vatican, as previous popes did during the days of the Kingdom of Italy. He refuses to acknowledge that [SRI.GetNameDef] rules Italy. However, so long as he is locked within the Vatican, he can do little but make noise. Now, the debate has been renewed: should we just leave the Pope alone to rant and rave, force the Conclave to pick a socialist Pope, or send him into exile?"
socitaly.50.a: "Exile the Pope!"
socitaly.50.b: "Make the Conclave elect a socialist priest"
socitaly.50.c: "Just let him complain"

socitaly.51.t: "The Papal Conclave Begins"
socitaly.51.d: "The Papal Conclave has begun! The Holy See shall come together and choose a new pope that shall support Socialism. It may take some time but they will eventually elect a new Pope who will do his part to liberate the faithful from their chains."
socitaly.51.a: "They shall choose right!"

socitaly.52.t: "A New Pope"
socitaly.52.d: "After many days of debating, the Conclave has elected Achille Liènart as John XXIII."
socitaly.52.a: "Yay!"

socitaly.53.t: "Exiling the Pope"
socitaly.53.d: "We have decided that the Pope has no place within our society, and that he shall be exiled. Where he goes, we don't care, but he shall not remain within Italy any longer!"
socitaly.53.a: "Get out of here!"

socitaly.54.t: "The Pope Arrives in [Root.GetNameDef]"
socitaly.54.d: "The Pope has arrived in [Root.GetNameDef] today, seeking refuge from the syndicalists within Italy who have exiled him from the country. A large crowd has already come out to meet the Holy Father. He has requested more permanent residence in one of our cathedrals, until such a time as the Vatican is once more restored to freedom."
socitaly.54.a: "Stay as long you want, Holy Father!"

socitaly.65.t: "The Vatican Commune"
socitaly.65.d: "We have recently concluded a productive meeting with the Pope. A tiny commune will be created around Saint Peter's Basilica called the Vatican Commune that will be independent from the Republic. Meanwhile, he will accept the legitimacy of our Republic and urge Catholics worldwide to do so as well. This marks a great day for the faithful and for the Republic."
socitaly.65.a: "Thank you, Holy Father!"

socitaly.66.t: "Revolutionary Irredentism"
socitaly.66.d: "There are still Italian lands and our Italian brothers and sisters that are held in bondage, and it is time that the Congress take a stance on their liberation. Some suggest focusing on just the ones in Austria, others think that we should focus on them but also include Malta. The Unione Nazionalista call for a true Greater Italia to be created as a new light of socialism in the world."
socitaly.66.a: "Just help liberate our comrades in Austria."
socitaly.66.b: "Austrian comrades and Maltese comrades both."
socitaly.66.c: "Greater Italia shall be the light of socialism!"

socitaly.67.t: "The New Lands"
socitaly.67.d: "It has been some time, but we have finally liberated our comrades. Now that socialism has come to the new lands of the republic, we can be secure knowing that we shall be a beacon of socialism within the International."
socitaly.67.a: "Avanti Italia!"

socitaly.68.t: "Trial for Reactionary Leaders"
socitaly.68.d: "With our victory over the reactionary forces, the leaders of the corrupt republic and the "noble" leaders of the despotic kingdoms are standing trial. Some want us to be lenient with them while others want us to be harsh and make an example of them. How shall the court rule?"
socitaly.68.a: "Lenient. We already have our victory."
socitaly.68.b: "Make an example of them."

socitaly.69.t: "What to do with Royal Palaces?"
socitaly.69.d: "With the conquest of the South, we have taken control of the territory of the Two Kingdom, and as we bring the revolution southward, the question of what to do about the various noble and royal palaces has arisen. Some think that they should be given over to the local communes, others think that the government should use them for the various ministry positions. Finally, some support the idea of giving them over to the Workers Youth League."
socitaly.69.a: "Turn them over to the local communes."
socitaly.69.b: "Make them government headquarters."
socitaly.69.c: "Make them youth camps."

socitaly.70.t: "Resistance to Secularism"
socitaly.70.d: "As we bring the revolution to the rest of Italy, our official policy of secularism is causing problems with reintegrating the Italian people into a cohesive nation. The Catholic Church was far more powerful in the rest of Italy than in our republic. Consequently, many people are trying to resist and slowing the progress of bringing the revolution to the rest of Italy."
socitaly.70.a: "They will learn in time."

socitaly.71.t: "Christian Socialist Policies Help"
socitaly.71.d: "As we bring the revolution to the rest of Italy, our Christian socialist policies are proving to be popular with the people and helpful in bringing them to understand the principles of socialism. While there is still quite a bit of resistance among the more dedicated reactionaries, there is less than our strategists expected before the war."
socitaly.71.a: "Thank God!"

socitaly.72.t: "Land Reform in Northern Italy"
socitaly.72.d: "Now that we have control of Northern Italy, it is time to bring land reform to the south and bring the revolution to the southern farmers. The package of land reforms prepared by the Congress will collectivise and give the land back to the farmers. Furthermore, local agriculture unions will be created to bring syndicalism south."
socitaly.72.a: "Break the chains!"

socitaly.73.t: "Industrialisation for the South"
socitaly.73.d: "The south was never industrialised to its full potential. However, now that we have control of the south we can begin a program to industrialise the region. This will help improve the lives of the people living there by bringing jobs and development and lowering inequality across Italy."
socitaly.73.a: "Progress moves south!"

socitaly.74.t: "Syndicalisation of the Economy"
socitaly.74.d: "With Italy now united, the question has arisen as to how to bring the syndicalist economy to the rest of Italy. Some think the best way is to focus on building up the unions in the areas. Others think the best way to syndicalise the rest of the country is to focus on collective farming. A third option is worker co-operatives, especially those that serve the military, which could be the key to revolutionizing the new regions."
socitaly.74.a: "Focus on the unions."
socitaly.74.b: "Focus on communal farming."
socitaly.74.c: "Focus on worker co-operatives."

socitaly.75.t: "New Communes"
socitaly.75.d: "With the rest of Italy now under our control, new revolutionary communes are being formed throughout the Republic, from Lombardy and Venetia to Sicily and Naples. These communes have become new social centres and bases for spreading the revolution in the areas."
socitaly.75.a: "Lunga Vita ai Comuni!"

socitaly.76.t: "Resistance to Social Changes"
socitaly.76.d: "Since we have united Italy there has been resistance against the various social changes that we have implemented in the Republic since its founding, particularly in the case of women's rights. The changes that we have brought to Italian society will take time, but eventually, the rest of Italy shall accept them."
socitaly.76.a: "Damn reactionaries!"

socitaly.77.t: "The Ministry of Public Security help prevent trouble"
socitaly.77.d: "The Ministry of Public Security have apprehended a number of reactionary traitors to the Republic operating in the south. The Ministers have made sure that no one in the rest of Italy will dare betray the revolution."
socitaly.77.a: "The Secret Police to the Rescue!"

socitaly.78.t: "Fasci Siciliani Founded"
socitaly.78.d: "The original Fasci Siciliani was a socialist movement in Sicily in the 1880s and 1890s. They were eventually crushed, but their legacy was long-lasting; they fought for democracy and socialism and were true revolutionaries. Today, a new Fasci Siciliani has been founded, drawing on the legacy of the old organisation. This new Fasci Siciliani is focusing on spreading the ideals of the republic into Sicily."
socitaly.78.a: "Long live the Fasci!"

socitaly.79.t: "Exhibition of the Revolution"
socitaly.79.d: "In 1919 the Socialist Republic of Italy was proclaimed. However, the resulting civil war would leave Italy divided. Since then, we have erased these false borders, reunified Italy, and brought the revolution to all corners of our country! To demonstrate our glorious victory to the people, a grand exhibition of the revolution and our struggles and losses has been unveiled in Roma. Celebrating the struggle to bring syndicalism to all corners of Italy, it will no doubt help to educate the masses about the revolution and inform them of the glory of a reunited Italy."
socitaly.79.a: "Long live the Republic!"

socitaly.80.t: "Women Entering Politics"
socitaly.80.d: "While women have been legally allowed to vote, work in politics, and sit in the National Congress since the founding of our Republic, it is only now that we have unified Italy that women throughout the whole of the country enjoy these rights. Many women, especially those from the south and the northeast where the reactionaries ruled, are now taking steps to enter politics for the first time in their lives, from local unions and communes to the Congress itself."
socitaly.80.a: "Great!"

socitaly.84.t: "Female Red Guard Divisions"
socitaly.84.d: "With the decision to create the Gruppi di Difesa della Donna, a number of women have formed their own defence unit based out of the city of Livorno. These women have called their unit the Prospero Brigade in honour of the minister who helped create the Gruppi in the first place."
socitaly.84.a: "We need every man and woman we can get!"

socitaly.85.t: "The Worker-Priest Movement"
socitaly.85.d: "The Worker-Priest movement is a movement for the priests of the Catholic Church to help connect to the faithful by working in factories like the laity. The movement is rather popular in the Republic at the moment, and affords the priests the opportunity to connect more closely to the people. Sometimes, sermons can even be heard inside factories and workshops after hours, as the faithful listen to the priests at the end of a long day."
socitaly.85.a: "Jesus was a carpenter, after all."

socitaly.86.t: "Christian Associations of Italian Workers"
socitaly.86.d: "The Christian Associations of Italian Workers, or Associazioni Cristiane dei Lavoratori Italiani (often abbreviated as ACLI), are the largest Catholic lay organisation within the Republic. The goal of the organisation is to help Catholics follow and live in accordance with the philosophy of Christian socialism. Unsurprisingly, the Associazioni are heavily connected with the Christian Socialist Union within the National Congress."
socitaly.86.a: "Let us follow in the steps of Jesus."

socitaly.87.t: "Futuristic Architecture"
socitaly.87.d: "'This is the greatest absurdity of modern architecture. It is perpetuated by the greedy complicity of academies, internment camps for the intelligentsia, where the young are forced to recopy classical models onanistically instead of straining their imaginations to search for solutions to new and urgent problems: the Futurist house and city. A house and city spiritually and materially our own, in which our riotous activity can rage without seeming a grotesque anachronism.' So reads the Futurist Manifesto of architecture. Futurism as an architectural movement has recently been highly popular among the Unione Nazionalista. Mussolini, in particular, is a noted patron of architects building in that style."
socitaly.87.a: "The Future is now!"

socitaly.88.t: "Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana"
socitaly.88.d: "The Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana, or Italian Recreational and Cultural Association, is the largest recreational society within the Republic. Founded in N in the 1920s and later relocated to Palermo, the organisation is purely secular, and its goal is to help support recreational activities for the people as well as to support solidarity amongst the citizens of the Republic. Culture that was once only the purview of the elites, such as opera, plays, and classical music, are now available for the people to enjoy. Furthermore, the Associazione supports book clubs, countryside vacations, and more through arrangements with local communes and unions."
socitaly.88.a: "Culture belongs to the masses!"

socitaly.89.t: "Unione Donne Italiane Congress"
socitaly.89.d: "'We don't see why the revolution is in the hands of only half the population. We are anarchists, but we are also women and we want to make our revolution. Not have men make it for us. We don't want a struggle designed to fit the male because we'll be screwed, as always. We want to fight so that we can claim our part in the share-out. We want to make it clear that just now we're beside ourselves with joy and it would be a mistake to keep us at home knitting! We want to die! But we want to die like men, not live like servants!' So said Ada Prospero at the annual congress of the Unione Donne Italiane, the largest women's organisation in the republic. The Union's goal is dedicated to women's emancipation and liberation. Ada Prospero, in particular, supports the creation of female combat units to fight for the unification of Italy."
socitaly.89.a: "We shall see."

socitaly.90.t: "1937 Championship between Bari and Naples"
socitaly.90.d: "The 1936-1937 Series A Finale for the Italian football league championship has reached the last round. Naples playing against Bari. Bari is the clear favourite to win, as they are the current reigning champions; however, the Naples team this year is playing strong. Who shall win the championship for this year?"
socitaly.90.a: "Who shall win, indeed!"

socitaly.91.t: "Bari Wins 1937 Championship game!"
socitaly.91.d: "It was a close match, but Bari won with a score of 2-1, remaining as the reigning champions of the Italian League. Naturally, the city of Bari is celebrating this victory."
socitaly.91.a: "Bari remains the champions!"

socitaly.92.t: "Naples Wins 1937 Championship Game!"
socitaly.92.d: "In a stunning upset, the Naples team defeated Bari 1-0. For the first time in just under a decade, the reigning champions were defeated. The city of Naples will surely be celebrating all night after this stunning victory."
socitaly.92.a: "Naples are the new champions!"

socitaly.100.t: "The Founding of Cinecittà"
socitaly.100.d: "Benito Mussolini unveiled the opening of Cinecittà today outside the city of Naples. Cinecittà was planned by numerous architects to be less of a film studio and more of a small cinema city. Mussolini himself was quoted as saying during the opening of the studio: 'Cinema is the most powerful weapon against Capitalism.'. Many aspiring filmmakers are already speaking with the unions of the area to see about producing films there, while some are already calling it Hollywood on the Arno."
socitaly.100.a: "Cinema is the most powerful weapon against Capitalism!"

socitaly.101.t: "Death of Filippo Turati"
socitaly.101.d: "Today, the great statesman Filippo Turati has passed away at the age of 79 years old. Filippo Turati was one of the last surviving founders of the Italian Socialist Party. His strong and constant support of the rights of the workers of Italy from his earliest days has made him famous throughout the Republic. In addition to founding the Socialist Party of Italy, he was also one of the principal architects of the constitution of the Socialist Republic of Italy. The funeral in Naples was attended by visitors from nations around the world and officials from across the political spectrum, all paying their respects to the late great leader as various labour songs were sung, including Inno dei Lavoratori which he penned himself."
socitaly.101.a: "The passing of a torch."

socitaly.102.t: "Maggio Musicale Napoletano"
socitaly.102.d: "In the city of Naples, conductor Vittorio Gui has created a new festival called the Maggio Musicale Napoletano, dedicated to performing operas and musicals free of charge for the people so that way the classics can be enjoyed by all citizens, not just the privileged elites. The opening opera for the festival was Giuseppe Verdi's Nabucco. While it is the first of its kind in Italy, Vittorio Gui has stated he hopes that the Maggio Musicale's success can be replicated in cities throughout the Republic."
socitaly.102.a: "Opera for the People!"

socitaly.103.t: "Enrico Fermi creates the Naples Pile-1"
socitaly.103.d: "Enrico Fermi has recently created the Naples Pile-1; the world's first artificial nuclear reactor. Created with the help of students from the University of Naples Federico II, the device may have only been capable of generating a half watt of power, but its success proves that a nuclear reactor can be built."
socitaly.103.a: "Comrade Fermi brings progress for the Republic and for the world!"

socitaly.104.t: "Enrico Fermi wins Noble Prize"
socitaly.104.d: "The physicist Enrico Fermi has recently won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity. Fermi, who has been a professor at the University of Naples Federico II since the civil war, has published numerous works on physics, especially relating to the new field of nuclear physics. With his Nobel Prize, the Socialist Republic of Italy can celebrate another hero of Italy and of Socialism."
socitaly.104.a: "A hero of the Republic!"

socitaly.105.t: "Commune of San Marino"
socitaly.105.d: "The city-state of San Marino is one of the longest surviving republics on the Italian Peninsula. A relic from the city-state era, San Marino has survived for centuries, lasting from the Roman era all the way to the Risorgimento, and even through the Civil War and the Second Risorgimento. It has long been a haven for refugees from oppression. Today, the elections have brought the Socialists into power in the city-state, and the new Captain Regents are working on bringing syndicalism to their tiny commune. They have assured our republic that they wish to remain friends and seek to build bridges between the two republics."
socitaly.105.a: "Greetings Comrades!"

socitaly.106.t: "Roma Jazz Festival"
socitaly.106.d: "With Rome once again the capital of Italy, a jazz festival has been put on by the various musical unions throughout Italy. Jazz has been within Italy since before the revolution, starting in 1904, though modern Italian Jazz draws inspiration from America. The famed American Jazz musician Louis Armstrong is the highlight of the festival."
socitaly.106.a: "Let us enjoy the new music of a new Rome."

socitaly.107.t: "Giro d'Italia Refounded"
socitaly.107.d: "With Italy reunited, the Giro d'Italia can begin again. The Giro d'Italia is a cycling race that began in 1909, but the outbreak of the Weltkrieg and the ongoing political instability in Italy have altogether prevented the race from being held since 1914. The race course goes from Torino in the north all the way down to Napoli and Bari in the south up back to Milan."
socitaly.107.a: "Let the race begin!"

socitaly.108.t: "Fausto Coppi Wins the Giro D'Italia"
socitaly.108.d: "Fausto Coppi has won the Giro D'Italia, setting a new record. At the age of twenty, he is the youngest cyclist to complete the race. His win has also popularized his training regime and his particular diet, which focuses on whole grains where other racers consume large amounts of red meat."
socitaly.108.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Coppi!"

socitaly.109.t: "Spartacus is Released"
socitaly.109.d: "Cinecittà has released the epic movie Spartacus. Telling the story of the ancient Roman slave rebellion leader Spartacus, the movie is by all accounts an epic with a cast of thousands. Starting Gino Cervi as Spartacus and directed by Carmine Gallone, the movie has already proven a success and both with critics and the public at large."
socitaly.109.a: "I am Spartacus!"

socitaly.110.t: "Comrade Ines Donati"
socitaly.110.d.ines_elected: "Ines Donati, a strong supporter of the policies of Mussolini and Bianchi, has just been elected for the rank of general in the Red Guards. She has proven to be rather popular among the soldiers, both men and women. Ines Donati is the first woman to be elected as a general from among the troops, and she will shine a beacon for all our female soldiers to follow."
socitaly.110.d.ines_promoted: "Ines Donati, a strong supporter of the policies of Mussolini and Bianchi, has just been promoted within the Red Army. She has proven to be rather popular among the soldiers, both men and women. Ines Donati is the first woman to be promoted to general in the new officer corps, and she will shine a beacon for all our female soldiers to follow."
socitaly.110.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Donati!"

socitaly.111.t: "The Grande Rivoluzione Culturale Proletaria Begins"
socitaly.111.d: "Comrade Mussolini spoke before a massive crowd today in Rome, declaring that Italy must be purged of all elements of reactionary and capitalist thought, and that the new futurist culture of Italy shall rise from its ashes to build an Italy that is the culmination of the declaration of revolution in 1919."
socitaly.111.a: "We must cleanse Italy of corruption!"

socitaly.112.t: "Destroy the Cult of the Past"
socitaly.112.d: "'With our enthusiastic adherence to Futurism, we will destroy the cult of the past, the obsession with the ancients, and the pedantry and academic formalism that have strangled our society. The past is feudalistic and capitalistic and must be wiped away. The Socialist Republic has no need for the past!' according to a state paper in Torino."
socitaly.112.a: "The past is gone!"

socitaly.113.t: "Spontaneous Revolutionary Violence"
socitaly.113.d: "The leader of the Ministry for Public Security has declared that it will be of no issue if reactionaries are killed by revolutionary violence. This has sparked a wave of violence throughout the country as people engage in spontaneous revolutionary violence against those considered reactionary. When this will be over, no one knows. But the reactionaries shall be purged!"
socitaly.113.a: "Death to the reactionaries!"

socitaly.114.t: "Bonfire of the Vanities"
socitaly.114.d: "In Naples, a massive bonfire was held where citizens threw various 'vanities' considered to be reactionary or capitalistic into the fires. Artwork from before the creation of the Socialist Republic of Italy, books that promoted reactionary thought or un-socialist principles, and household goods deemed bourgeois were also destroyed. This bonfire has been copied by other cities across the republic as many seek to destroy the culture of the past."
socitaly.114.a: "Destroy the capitalist vanities!"

socitaly.115.t: "Purging the Reactionaries"
socitaly.115.d: "A number of the ministers in the government hold rather reactionary views. While they claim to be dedicated to the Republic, we know better. People like Achille Grandi, Giacomo Matteotti, and Giuseppe Saragat are all reactionaries that must be purged! They and others will only corrupt the ideals of socialism and bring back capitalism to the Republic. This will not be allowed!"
socitaly.115.a: "We shall not be corrupted!"

socitaly.116.t: "Destruction of Churches"
socitaly.116.d: "'God does not exist - religion in science is an absurdity, in practice an immorality, and in men a disease.' So proclaims Chairman Mussolini. With that, the attention of the cultural revolutionaries has turned towards Christianity and religion. Churches across Italy have been set upon by Garibaldists. Some have been transformed into town halls, with all sign of them being once a place of worship gone. Even more have been destroyed outright, or laid siege by revolutionaries as devout Christians barricaded themselves in. From the tiny parish churches that dot the towns of Italy to the largest cathedrals in the country, none have been spared. It seems that Comrade Mussolini will not stop until every trace of superstition is destroyed!"
socitaly.116.a: "Death to superstition!"

socitaly.117.t: "Technicians in the Country and Bureaucrats in the Factories"
socitaly.117.d: "The Republic is to not be a bureaucratic republic. However, in the years since its foundation, that has been changing and bureaucrats have been coming back within the government and within the workplaces. In order to make sure that the republic is not bureaucratised, factory technicians and leaders will be made to spend time in the countryside and government bureaucrats will be made to spend time within the factories."
socitaly.117.a: "Break the chains!"

socitaly.118.t: "Quotations from Chairman Mussolini"
socitaly.118.d: "In order to spur on the Cultural Revolution, the thoughts and quotes of Benito Mussolini have been made into a small book that has been printed en masse for citizens to study as they try to follow in the footsteps of the Chairman."
socitaly.118.a: "Heed the wise words of Comrade Chairman Mussolini."

socitaly.119.t: "Futurist Food"
socitaly.119.d: "As the cultural revolution continues, a book called the Manifesto of Futurist Cooking has been published. Its purpose is to ensure that even the daily habits of eating are transformed. The book has some choice words reserved for pasta; 'No more pasta, as it causes lassitude, pessimism and lack of passion,' a position backed up by Mussolini himself, who is quoted as saying 'a nation of spaghetti eaters cannot have a social revolution'"
socitaly.119.a: "Food of the future!"

socitaly.120.t: "The Strength of the Army"
socitaly.120.d: "As the Cultural Revolution continues, the Army has become more and more important in keeping order and stability. However, within the upper echelons of command, some have started to wonder if the methods of the cultural revolution are productive in building a new society and culture for Italy."
socitaly.120.a: "The Army will protect the revolution, of course."

socitaly.121.t: "Destruction of Estates"
socitaly.121.d: "Many noble estates in the south have been destroyed. The lands of the old S.R.I. held a number of noble estates, and the people in the south have finally decided to destroy these estates and make sure that there is no trace of the relics of the old feudal order."
socitaly.121.a: "Death to feudalism!"

socitaly.122.t: "Mussolini's Personality Cult"
socitaly.122.d: "A cult of personality has begun to grow around Mussolini, thanks to his efforts at using his personal charisma as well as the mass media from newspaper to film to make sure that his image is respected and supported. Portraits of Mussolini have popped up in public and private spaces alike throughout the country."
socitaly.122.a: "All for Mussolini!"

socitaly.123.t: "Revolutionary Films"
socitaly.123.d: "To build a new culture, we must destroy the old one. Archaic plays and operas are no longer to be performed. Instead, using the new film industry, a new culture celebrating the revolution and the Republic will be created. Mussolini, in particular, is sponsoring new actors, actresses and directors that will praise the Cultural Revolution."
socitaly.123.a: "Film will bring about a new culture."

socitaly.124.t: "End of the Cultural Revolution"
socitaly.124.d: "Tragically and somewhat mysteriously, Mussolini has died in a plane crash. With his death, Michele Bianchi has assumed control of the Republic. Bianchi has declared that the Cultural Revolution has been victorious and as such, it should come to an end. With its end, he has begun to slowly scale back some of the 'reforms' that were passed during the Revolution, notably the enforcement of futurist food."
socitaly.124.a: "The Revolution is over."

socitaly.125.t: "The End of the Revolution"
socitaly.125.d: "Mussolini has declared in Rome that the Cultural Revolution is now at an end. The reactionary culture that has infected Italy since the Republic was declared is gone. Today, the sun shines on a new Italia, and the violence and chaos that has reigned over Italy has begun to subside. Life has been changed, but the Republic has been made stronger; or at least, that is what Comrade Mussolini says. It is clear, though, that his grip on power is now absolute."
socitaly.125.a: "The Revolution is over."

socitaly.126.t: "Syndicalist Partisans Rise Up"
socitaly.126.d: "We've always had suspicions that there was an underground network of syndicalists preparing for the day when we and [SRI.GetNameDef] went to war. Their numbers are not overwhelming, but their appearance behind our lines is unexpected, and they have caused a fair amount of disruption throughout the country."
socitaly.126.a: "It will change nothing"

socitaly.127.t: "The Balance in Italy"
socitaly.127.d.ita: "The balance on the Italian peninsula has been delicate since the end of the civil war, with [SRI.GetNameDef] maintaining a tense peace with its neighbors due to the knowledge that drawing in the French would surely bring intervention from the Germans and Austrians. Thus any conflict in Italy would need to be a self-contained one. With [ITA.GetNameDef] drawing in its own allies into the war, the situation has now officially changed: the balance is broken."

socitaly.205.t: "The March on Naples"
socitaly.205.d: "While we thought Giovanni Messe could be trusted, it seems as if we were wrong, today, just hours after the 4th Party Congress ended in deadlock; the General and 1000 men attempted to take over the capital, fighting with Baron Evola who has his more radical plans for the Peninsula. With our grand Militias struggling to keep power, to hold onto Socialism in Italy. There are also rumours that Riccardo Lombardi and his Fasci movement of peasant militias plan on securing the city, the NeoSanfedisti have also been seen marching from the north. The fighting is still intense, and the day ended with..."
socitaly.205.a: "General Messe and his forces defeating the army and securing control!"
socitaly.205.b: "The Army regaining control and killing Messe!"
socitaly.205.c: "Evola's Legion seizing control!"
socitaly.205.e: "Lombardi's fascist militias emerging to defend socialism and democracy!"
socitaly.205.f: "The Mafia takes Charge over the crumbling State!"
socitaly.205.g: "The NeoSanfedisti victoriously marching through the streets of Naples!"

socitaly.206.t: "The Legitimate King Returns!"
socitaly.206.d: "After spreading pro-House of Savoy propaganda and sending out diplomats to secure his arrival, King Emmanuel III has arrived in Naples via ship being greeted by Messe himself whom lavished praised on the King for his support of his cause. While the King does not seem enthusiastic about Messe’s more revolutionary views he nonetheless lavished praise on him for his loyalty to the Aristocracy and his respectulfulness towards his majesty, noting that he and the Military's undying loyalty will be repaid in full and the socialists will be pushed back into the French Commune."
socitaly.206.a: "Long Live the King!"

socitaly.207.t: "A United Italy?"
socitaly.207.d: "After General Messe and his men defeated the southern traitors, there have been many peace talks with the new Confederation, and talks about eventual unification with the south. In one of these meetings, Messe himself was invited to Roma, where he brought up one request; that the former king of Italy be restored to the throne in exchange for forming a united Italy. The Northern government decided to..."
socitaly.207.a: "Accept the proposal! For King Victor Emmanuel III and a united Italy!"
socitaly.207.b: "Deny the proposal! We will end Italian Monarchism once and for all!"

socitaly.208.t: "Legacy of the Fasci Siciliani"
socitaly.208.d: "The Fasci Siciliani dei Lavoratori, Sicilian Workers League, was a popular socialist movement which arose in Sicily during the 1890’s. Gaining support amongst the poorest of the working class who were frustrated with class inequality and political corruption. The Fasci demanded social reforms and when these were not met they began an outburst of strikes that rapidly spread throughout Sicily. The Sicilian peasants who fought and died for their rights are still remembered to this day as an important force in left-wing Italian politics, especially within Southern Italy..."
socitaly.208.a: "We remember the fascists!"

socitaly.209.t: "Rise of Futurism"
socitaly.209.d: "Futurism is an artistic social movement that emphasizes speed, technology, youth and violence. It has emerged as a radical rejection of tradition, opposing both reactionarism and liberalism. Founded by poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the movement has served as an avant-garde vanguard against Italy’s traditionalist and socially conservative populace. It is for this reason that Marinetti has found himself an audience with Chairman Mussolini, Mussolini has admired futurism since its initial inception and hopes that by using this movement the S.R.I can modernize its image. In response Marinetti and other prominent futurists, have pledged their loyalty and support to the Unione Nazionalista!"
socitaly.209.a: "Let us race to the future!"

socitaly.210.t: "Merging the post of President and Chairman"
socitaly.210.d: "Today, Chairman Mussolini has made a bold announcement on the steps of the Congressional Building: stating if we are to achieve true revolution and ensure the security and stability of the republic, we must break away the shackles of oligarchic parliamentarianism and hand the reins of government over to a strong leader who can defend Socialism from pseudo-capitalist forces in our government. Just before this announcement, the former president of the National Congress, Michele Bianchi had seemingly disappeared. With no one to prevent him, Benito Mussolini has decided to merge the posts of President and Chairman, effectively giving him unlimited control of the government."
socitaly.210.a: "I am the Congress"

##FASCISM GANG##
socfascist.1.t: "The Fasci Revival"
socfascist.1.d: "Chairman Di Vittorio’s rule has been controversial to say least, critics of the regime have accused him of focusing far too much on military defence against the Federation, leaving the poor rural peasants especially in Sicily to deal with worsening living standards and food shortages. With the Federation and National French fleets blockading much of the Third Internationale’s food aid, there have been increasing calls for a decreasing of tensions with the North and restructuring of the S.R.I. One major figure is syndicalist politician Riccardo Lombardi. Originally supportive of Di Vittorio before changing allegiance to the Unione Socialista Cristiana, he has now founded his own movement. A member of the Fasci Siciliani in his youth, Lombardi has formed the 'Fascio Italiano dei lavoratori', or more simply the 'Fasci'. Inspired by the movement of the 1890s, the Fasci are calling on greater social justice and implementation of peasant democracy whilst providing a more moderate stance on Italian reunification..."
socfascist.1.a: "More troublemakers..."
socfascist.2.t: "Fascists Rally Support"
socfascist.2.d: "The Fasci movement has seen a surge in support amongst the poorest of South Italy, with both former supporters of the revolution and anti-syndicalists flocking to Lombardi’s movement. Combining populist and socialist rhetoric with religious and nationalist sentiment, Lombardi has called on the Italian working class to unite with their northern brothers. At one recent rally, portraits of both Jesus Christ and Gariboldi could be seen carried by Fasci militiamen, furthermore members of the Unione Socialista Cristiana have been invited by Lombardi to speak as guests. These recent moves show that the Fasci aim to provide a big tent opposition to the S.R.I establishment that could provide us with difficulties in subduing the populace if we don't take action..."
socfascist.2.a: "We must provide direct aid to the Sicilian peasantry!"
socfascist.2.b: "The workers of Italy know who their true saviours are...us!"
socfascist.3.t: "Peasants Demand Further Support"
socfascist.3.d: "Our goal to curb the Fasci’s influence over Sicily and Calabria has worked in persuading many of the working class to maintain support for our government, however our promises in food aid are not enough. Local union branches are demanding further economic aid and a decrease in military funding that be then put into funding agricultural projects. We could agree to the demands, further weakening the Fasci’s momentum however this could result in Mussolini’s influential Unione Nazionalista and the S.R.I military withdrawing their support for the chairman..."
socfascist.3.a: "Provide all the aid they request."
socfascist.3.b: "We simply can not divert anymore resources..."
socfascist.4.t: "Southern Italian Peasants Appeased!"
socfascist.4.d: "Our pledges to provide economic assistance to the poorest regions of Southern Italy have so far resulted in local syndicalist unions in Sicily and Calabria withdrawing their support for the Fasci. The Unione Socialista Cristiana too have welcomed our plans and announced their intention to support Chairman Di Vittorio, meanwhile Riccardo Lombardi has seen his support base crippled. It is unlikely his movement will be able to re-captivate the working class any time soon..."
socfascist.4.a: "One less issue to deal with..."
socfascist.5.t: "Fascists fail to rally the masses..."
socfascist.5.d: "After losing the support of local syndicalist unions, Lombardi and the Fasci movement have attempted to rally support elsewhere. Hoping to forge connections with the anti-syndicalist social democrats and nationalists the Fasci have instead seen dwindling membership. For now they have been reduced to small organizations of political thinkers instead of the mass labour movement Lombardi had envisioned."
socfascist.5.a: "It was always a movement of nostalgic reenactors..."
socfascist.6.t: "Fascists March North"
socfascist.6.d: "Lombardi has rallied his peasants militias and held peaceful marches in Basilicata and Apulia, diverging from the original Fasci Sicilia by appealing to workers in regions to the north. Many believe that Lombardi aims to maintain this wave of popularity and march on Naples, directly challenging the Chairman would be of great embarrassment to the entire S.R.I. Therefore many within the government have suggested providing economic relief to the most impoverished regions and also expanding political power to local unions. Afterall Lombardi’s surge of popularity is based almost entirely on disgruntled rural workers, a direct appeal to them could help dissuade potential fascists..."
socfascist.6.a: "Provide economic relief!"
socfascist.6.b: "We shall endure these temporary annoyances!"
socfascist.7.t: "Lombardi Forges Alliances"
socfascist.7.d: "Fascist leader, Riccardo Lombardi, has been forging close contacts with several groups opposed to our government. The most prominent is the Unione Socialista Cristiana who after being sidelined by Di Vittorio’s decision to align with Mussolini’s Unione Nazionalista have responded by opposing most government decisions. This week leaders of both Christian Socialism and Fascism held joint prayers and then announced the close ties that the Fasci and Christian trade unions currently hold.\n\n The Fasci also held joint processions with republican-nationalist organisations to commemorate the Expedition of the Thousand. Delivering a speech in which Lombardi compared the Fasci to the Red Shirts and stating, 'Fascism is the ideology of the masses and an ideology built upon cooperation.' With recent rumours of Fascist contacts with the Papacy and PPI, the potential of the Fasci being used by the North to undermine us is worrying..."
socfascist.7.a: "We have to stop him!"
socfascist.8.t: "An Offer from the South"
socfascist.8.d: "Chairman Lombardi of the Southern Fascist state has just sent a Letter to [ITA.GetLeader]. This message proposed Unifying Italy based on common bonds and reclaiming our Stolen Lands from Austria. This would be a big change, however the Fasci are willing to offer concessions in exchange for Italian Unity. "
socfascist.8.a: "Not a Chance"
socfascist.8.b: "Cut them a Deal"
socfascist.9.t: "The North Accepts, with a catch"
socfascist.9.d: "The ‘Socialist’ Pope has accepted our offer, and has agreed to the reunification of Italy under the condition that the Pope still technically remain the Head of State, and that the Church would enjoy the same protections as in the North. "
socfascist.9.a: "Good enough"
socfascist.9.b: "No."
socfascist.10.t: "The North Accepts, with a catch"
socfascist.10.d: "The Government in the North has accepted our offer to Unite Italy, under the condition that the Nation’s current political system survives, the position and safety of the Pope is guaranteed and communities in the North receive a high degree of autonomy. "
socfascist.10.a: "Good enough"
socfascist.10.b: "No."
socfascist.11.t: "The North Rejects"
socfascist.11.d: "The fools in Rome has chosen to keep the People of Italy divided! This has outraged many, however due to the weakened state of the Military many believe that we should not take any immediate Military Action, and instead wait for the crumbing Italian Federation to rot and collapse, and then pick up the scraps. "
socfascist.11.a: "To War!"
socfascist.11.b: "Let it go."
socfascist.12.t: "The Congress Assembles"
socfascist.12.d: "Chairman Lombardi has gathered his allies in Naples for a congress. Unlike in the old SRI, this congress will be one truly representative of the people and will not have such radicals like Mussolini attending. This “New Congress” is another stark contrast to the Militaristic and Bureaucratic nature of the old SRI, and a testament to how the new regime is friendlier to the people and the workers. In this congress, the future of the nation’s policies will be decided, and the factions will assort themselves. Currently, Lombardi’s support base is split between 3 branches: the non-Atheist Syndicalists, the PSI’s base in our current lands, and of course Lombardi’s original faction. "
socfascist.12.a: "The Syndicalist Faction!"
socfascist.12.b: "The Social-Democratic Faction!"
socfascist.12.c: "The Radical Socialist Faction!"



srievola.1010.t: "Camicie Nere - Evolian exodus"
srievola.1010.d: "The far-right militant Camicie Nere, associated with traditional integralism, has seen a membership drop since ultra-right philosopher Julius Evola declared his intention to leave the group in an official capacity due to their overly moderate stance to the Socialist Republic and commitment to non-violent means. Noting that neither can benefit the descendents of the Roman nation or more importantly its "Spirit". He is joined by his longtime Evolian followers whom are dubbed "Radical Traditionalists", anti-clerical nationalists, ultra-right veteran groups and hardline House of Savoy restorationists. The Camicie Nere is clearly irritated that he has left with more members than he entered in with."
srievola.1010.a: "Hopefully the Split will weaken them"

srievola.1020.t: "The Noble Legion of the Awakening"
srievola.1020.d: "The Noble Legion of the Awakening is the umbrella name for a loose grouping of militia societies devoted to the ideas of Julius Evola, receiving funds to protect nobles loyal to their cause from banditry and socialism. The perceived weakness of the Chairman in this trying time has led to more-and-more jobless young men viewing their demands for an immediate revolution (or, as they would call it, counter-revolution) to the Italian "rump state" as valid. It's speculated that their growth and ability to provide for members is also the result of funding from aligned royalist exiles in Sardinia, the Republic of Italy and amongst the reactionary members of the House of Savoy whom appreciate the loyalty seemingly pledged to them by Evola."
srievola.1020.a: "Leave it alone for now"
srievola.1020.b: "Warn their Donors"

srievola.1030.t: "The UR Group"
srievola.1030.d: "It is rumored that Evola has expanded his high-secret society, the infamous "UR group" which according to government documents is devoted to discovering "Arcane Knowledge" and is managed by Arthur Reghini. While more practical financial backers of Evola have partially succeeded at confusing the public as to whether its existence is real or merely "syndicalist slander" members of our intelligence services have little doubt it has gained further membership from predominately the sons of aristocratic families both here and in the North, so while the group remains small the connections it provides are quite powerful. More conservative members of our government want to find and arrest members for 'promoting indecency' while the socialists would prefer to focus on the Noble Legion of the Awakening for their part in attacking left-leaning unions. What should we do?"
srievola.1030.a: "We can't afford to intervene right now"
srievola.1030.b: "Investigate the UR Group"
srievola.1030.c: "Focus on the Legion"
srievola.1030.e: "Fight Both"

srievola.1040.t: "Attempted murder of Donato Manduzio"
srievola.1040.d: "A wounded World War One veteran whom become a self-taught Italian mystic, Donato Manduzio famously converted to Judaism with a small group of Catholics after the war and bases his community out of San Nicandro. Today however a bomb was mailed to his home which destroyed his residence but thankfully went off while when he was in the backyard. It's generally agreed to be an assasination attempt by "The Sons of Hyperborea", an extreme Evolian group that has affilations with the Noble Legion of the Awakening and are said to be behind a string of terrorist attacks with this being their most dangerous one. While there is no evidence of him being directly involved and denying that he encouraged it Evola nonethless defended the attempt on Manduzio's life as defending the "Aryan Spirit" from someone whom is using his mystical abilites "in aid of the Materialistic Spirit that abetted our descension into Kali Yuga". While some anti-Semites and superstituous elements of society are in agreement with this the attack and Evola's apologism has angered the public and political class unlike the more popular vigilante attacks on syndicalists and criminals that his supporters have conducted. With even some integralists denouncing him we could move on Evola now."
srievola.1040.a: "Arrest him"
srievola.1040.b: "We can't make a martyr out of him" 

srievola.1050.t: "Evola goes underground!"
srievola.1050.d: "Julius Evola has gone underground, probably being protected within a stronghold of the Noble Legion of the Awakening. With the level of unrest in the air we can not afford to use valuable troops to find him until we have at least got the criminals and various political militias under control."
srievola.1050.a: "Damn"
srievola.1050.b: "At least assign investigators"

srievola.1060.t: "Evola declares March on Naples"
srievola.1060.d: "The Noble Legion of the Awakening have declared their intention to March on Naples and oust the unpopular Chairman, stating that the governments favoritism for foreign capitalists and socialists over the people of Italy has been made far too clear. Other smaller radical traditionalist groups that collaborate with the Legion to the point of arguably being regional sub-entities such as the Sicilian Warriors of Tradition and the Soldiers of the Aryan Spirit are expected to join them. Sympathetic integralists and nationalists will likewise be joining in."
srievola.1060.a: "How much support can they have?"
srievola.1060.b: "How much support can they have?"

srievola.1070.t: "The March"
srievola.1070.d: "About 11,000 armed men are marching on Naples and towards the Congressional building to demand that the State be given to the force of Tradition. The Chairman could have the army intervene and should expect success if he does but his lack of confidence since Black Monday and the growth of militia groups has not gone unnoticed with some rumoring that he believes this is a sign that the Socialist Republic is finally finished. What shall he do?"
srievola.1070.a: "Let them March, let's hope they cause no trouble"
srievola.1070.b: "Stand our Ground"

srievola.1080.t: "The March"
srievola.1080.d: "About 7,000 men are marching on Naples and towards the Congressional building to demand that the State be given to the force of Tradition. The Chairman could have the army intervene and should expect success if he does but his lack of confidence since Black Monday and the growth of militia groups has not gone unnoticed with some rumoring that he believes this is a sign the Socialist Republic is finally finished. What shall he do?"
srievola.1080.a: "Let them March, let's hope they cause no trouble"
srievola.1080.b: "Stand our Ground"

srievola.1090.t: "Legion Broken"
srievola.1090.d: "While the fight was bloody the Legion has been fought off and the strong points they occupied during the March in other areas of the nation have been recovered. Evola himself was caught attempting to flee the country by boat and when stopped by officers fired on them with a revolver before being gunned down himself. With the Legion broken the aristocrats whom opposed the Socialist rule have lost much of their threatening presence and influence and he can now do what it takes to save Italy."
srievola.1090.a: "Long Live the Chairman!"

srievola.1100.t: "The Legion takes Power!"
srievola.1100.d: "The Chairman and many other prominent Socialists' flight has broken the spirit and organization of our state as many high level government officials did the same when they heard what happened. To make matters worse the Legion took over ports and other cities while the March was occuring and without any orders to push them back they managed to take these regions with little resistance. Thus at the moment it appears they control our nation."
srievola.1100.a: "My God"

srievola.1110.t: "Acts of Vigilantism"
srievola.1110.d: "The Legion has long supported a hardline stance against criminalism and degeneracy but now that the government has fled they are taking little mercy on the known criminals and hardline Bourbon supporters in the area. While Evola is ecstatic that this wave of violence symbolizes the rebirth of our society's true spirit some of his officers have advised him to pull back Legion forces to organize them into our forces."
srievola.1110.a: "No, it's good practice for war"
srievola.1110.b: "Yes, we need to pull back our forces for now"

srievola.1120.t: "The Question of Wealth"
srievola.1120.d: "Our increased diplomatic overtures to Italian Aristocrats in exile have not gone unnoticed and they have been generous in their donations, alongside support from the House of Savoy. While we have already spent some of the money to stabilize the regime by supporting the Legion some wealth remains. The question now is how we should invest these goods?"
srievola.1120.a: "Expand the Base Army"
srievola.1120.b: "More for the Administration"
srievola.1120.c: "Build needed factories"

srievola.1130.t: "Parliament Razed"
srievola.1130.d: "In a massively symbolic gesture a Legion ceremony was held today in the former parliament in which Evola gave a speech complimenting the Legion for their loyalty and that this was the first step of many from a material world to a spiritual one. The Legion recited a prayer inspired largely by the Mithraic mystery ritual while Evola burned the constitution. They then orderly exited the building and burned it down but not before supposedly drawing symbols inside for good luck. While foreign critics and the government-in-exile have decried this as "madness" it has been a massive blow to the morale of local liberals."
srievola.1130.a: "That should send the message"

srievola.1140.t: "Knights of the Grail initiates"
srievola.1140.d: "Initiated by a blood pact with their Legion commander the Knights of the Grail are now our internal security elite, tasked with special operations missions, investigations and upholding the values of Tradition at all costs. Some are suggesting that we not only allow Legion militants in whom are supported by Legion Commanders but also allow our regional allies to join, while others want our requirements to be stronger in the future and for someone to both a veteran and vouched for by someone of Noble Blood to become a Grail Knight, claiming this will earn us their undying loyalty. What shall we do?"
srievola.1140.a: "Keep it as is"
srievola.1140.b: "Allow more loyalists in"
srievola.1140.c: "Make requirements stricter from now on"

srievola.1150.t: "Knights of the Grail Slaughtering Liberals"
srievola.1150.d: "The Knights of the Grail are tasked with investigating and capturing prominent liberals whom have gone underground as ordered by Evola and have been told to end their treachery. While initially this was thought to mean arresting them, most of the Knights are taking the opportunity to kill them on sight alongside whomever may be hiding them and confiscating their property. The most frequent of these victims are former labor union leaders and activists. This is not against their rules and indeed according to the Legion command it's an excellent chance for Nation to experience violent redemption but nonetheless some are saying that Evola should at least require political opponents to be brought in before being tried and executed in a more lawful fashion."
srievola.1150.a: "Tis only flesh wounds"
srievola.1150.b: "I'd prefer "alive" if possible"

srievola.1160.t: "Integralist incorporation"
srievola.1160.d: "With the Legion's gambit paying off a majority of the Integralists have viewed us as the best means of restoring Italian Monarchism to its full potential. The faction led by Archille Stanation and Filippo Anfuso have pledged loyalty to Legion values and acknowledged that Parlimentry tactics and attempting to instate National Catholicism under the Bourbon King was a desperate Gambit to save Italy from socialism, but that the path laid out by Evola is now the correct one. However more religiously fervent and morally disgusted members of the Integralist coalition, including Bernardo Attolico, Carmine Senise and Luigi Rizzo have refused to pledge loyalty and simply stated that they would continue to oppose "demonic demagoguery". Together they have chosen to continue the Camicie Nere as a separate organization that continues to ignore our society's Spiritual Revolt. While our militants want to attack them now some more politically-minded supporters, including our newest members, would prefer to wait and give them a chance to see reason."
srievola.1160.a: "Purge the remnant Camicie Nere where we can"
srievola.1160.b: "We will give them time to change their minds"

srievola.1170.t: "Integralist Resistance"
srievola.1170.d: "The Camicie Nere has gone from merely being a nuisance to being to the Legion, in the words of Evola, a "lingering modernist tumor". Since our attempts to strike the Catholic Church it has seen a growth as it has billed itself as the "defenders of Catholicism" and even mainstream conservative catholics such as Mario Scelba have reportedly joined them. The King has reassured the people he is merely opposing the presently pseudo-Christian Vatican for weakening the state while Evola has privately done the opposite with the Legion and declared the Holy War against darkness as truly beginning. With the Camicie Nere attacking Legion garrisons, stealing supplies and launching propaganda campaigns against us we must stop them. We could punish their families in an effort to flush them out or simply interrogate priests whom are undoubtedly hiding them. Whom should we focus on?"
srievola.1170.a: "The Families"
srievola.1170.b: "The Church"

srievola.1180.t: "Bombing of Bari"
srievola.1180.d: "The Camice have attacked our factories and soldiers today after setting off an explosive in a port in Bari. They must be found at once! Shall we assign more Grail Knights to the investigation or make our war with the remaining Integralists our top priority?"
srievola.1180.a: "Put more Knights on the case"
srievola.1180.b: "This is now our top priority"

srievola.1190.t: "Camicie Nere Found"
srievola.1190.d: "After torturing enough captured Camice agents we have at long last discovered the Camice's headquarters in a farmhouse in rural Palermo, with Bernardo Attolico and Mario Scelba themselves being apprehended in the raid. Carmine Senise and Luigi Rizzo were not found however and are said to have fled to Portugal where the Catholic government protects them. Nonetheless from the supplies found it is both clear they were receiving foreign funding and, more importantly, have lost too much to recover as they have been chipped away at for too long to handle a blow of this size. While not all citizens have embraced us this may mark the end of our largest internal political resistance. Now while the Camice Nere soldiers are being publicly executed the question remains of what to do with their leaders, with some advocating a harsher death and others wanting to throw them in a deep hole and see if they break to give up more information."
srievola.1190.a: "Give them the same fate as their comrades"
srievola.1190.b: "Public Stoning"
srievola.1190.c: "Throw them in Oubliettes"

srievola.1200.t: "Battle for Bari"
srievola.1200.d: "It appears that some of the troops guarding the port of Bari had yet to understand that their government had truly lost. Under their commander they valiantly attempted to hold the port in the pathetic hope their Socialist Chairman would save them but without support they gradually became drained of resources and surrendered. What shall be done with them?"
srievola.1200.a: "Swift Execution"
srievola.1200.b: "Crucifixion"
srievola.1200.c: "Hard Labor for Life" 

srievola.1210.t: "Sicily Resists"
srievola.1210.d: "The Sicilian Mafia has been acting in conjunction with local rebels to oppose our rule over the region, with the Mafia being motivated by our attempts to confiscate their ill gotten gains and the rebels motivated largely by either demands for democracy or for us to cease our attacks on Catholicism. When only a small detachment of Legionaries or a Grail Knight enter the region they are ambushed so we must act in absolution. We could either put Sicily under siege and use our navy to block them from supplies until the rebel leaders turn themselves in or the population turns on them. Or we could land a garrison on the island to fight their way to the capital and eliminate all listed enemies, followed by hunting down rural mob bosses."
srievola.1210.a: "Embargo"
srievola.1210.b: "Take Palermo"

srievola.1220.t: "Sicilians Broken"
srievola.1220.d: "Sicily at long last no longer has the capacity to oppose our rule. With mobsters fleeing the area and rebels being starved out the region is now ours. But perhaps we should set an example?"
srievola.1220.a: "Sicily is now a Legion outpost"
srievola.1220.b: "Sicily is now our serfs"
srievola.1220.c: "Annihilate all whom may be treacherous"

srievola.1230.t: "Punishment for Thievery"
srievola.1230.d: "While organized bandits still exist in these difficult economic times so too does the simple thief whom thinking of little more than their gluttonous desires disobeys our New Order and in the process debases both himself and the rest of society. What shall be the new penalty for a crime that can not be afforded when we battle the forces of chaos and nihilism themselves?"

srievola.1230.c: "Their Life"

srievola.1240.t: "The King Arrives"
srievola.1240.d: "After spreading pro-House of Savoy propaganda and sending out diplomats to secure his arrival, King Emmanuel III has arrived in Naples via ship being greeted by Evola himself whom lavished praised on the King for his support of his cause. While the King does not seem enthusiastic about Evola's more revolutionary views he nonetheless lavished praise on him for his loyalty to the Aristocracy and his respectulfulness towards his majesty, noting that he and the Legion's undying loyalty will be repaid in full and the socialists will be pushed back into the French Commune."
srievola.1240.a: "Long Live Emmanuel III!"
srievola.1240.b: "Long Live Emmanuel III, hail his Baron Julius Evola!"

srievola.1250.t: "The question of the Churches"
srievola.1250.d: "With many priests whom are refusing to renounce Papal authority in favor of the King fleeing the area or disappearing the question of what to do with their churches remains. Any churches deemed abandoned are now under the control of King Emmanuel III, to the outrage of the Papacy. Baron Evola would like to repurpose them as Legion posts where ceremonies can be held but other proposals are to hand it to the Nobility as a reward for loyalty or allow the serfs to take them over. However some Legionaries have rejected each of these proposals and have stated that they should be stripped clean of their riches by the state then burned to the ground to help end Papal influence in Two Siciles, an alternative Evola himself does not seem opposed to. While the King is known to be anti-clerical and to have a hatred of the Pope's attempts to control him most are unsure he would go so far."
srievola.1250.a: "For the Military"
srievola.1250.b: "For the Nobility"
srievola.1250.c: "For the Serfs"
srievola.1250.e: "Burn them down"

srievola.1260.t: "Concubinage"
srievola.1260.d: "With our enemies being felled and the repeal of "women's rights" as conceived by absurd liberalism, the Legion has become increasingly public about their advocacy of Warriors being able to take on concubines, either gifted by the King for their services or "won in war", a practice the Legion is rumored to secretly be practicing by passing them off off as "mistresses". Much of the cause of these demands are from Evola's denunciation of monogomy for being what he views as a means for women to enslave male virility to "Eros", claiming not only that classrievolaal civilizations allowed the practice but that the domination of women was a natural way of expressing the male spirit. On a practical level it would also allow for a faster growing population of Legionaries. While the King is surprised by this turn of events he is also well aware this could keep the Nobles happy if he instituted it just for them and this would have less impact on society. On the other hand he could inspire soldiers by allowing them to take concubines via conquest if their Commander allows it as well. What shall he do?"
srievola.1260.a: "Only for Nobles"
srievola.1260.b: "For Legion and Nobles"
srievola.1260.c: "Soldiers are eligable as well"
srievola.1260.e: "It's too radical just keep Monogomy"

srievola.1270.t: "Catholics angered"
srievola.1270.d: "Many traditional Catholics are to say the least not happy with our decision to utterly destroy the Papacy, claiming it amounts to essentially declaring a holy war on the Catholic Church. While many are too fearful to make a move the former Papal States have grown increasingly unstable. We could try to simply use the Knights of the Grail to calm the situation by attacking the loudest troublemakers but it would likely be more prudent to send in the military."
srievola.1270.a: "Just Send Knights"
srievola.1270.b: "Send the Military"

srievola.1280.t: "Rebellion in Papal States"
srievola.1280.d: "As predicted our efforts to eradicate the Church in the former Papal States have not gone over smoothly, with angered citizens and the former members of the Palatinate Guard whom refuse to serve the House of Savoy uniting to try to push out the Legion. We have lost a fair few soldiers already but it is obvious we will eventually retake the city as the rebels have no other support and are largely acting out of desperation. We could attempt to capture the city with the troops although we would likely lose many men in the process. Or, ironically, we could learn from the legacy of Cesare Borgia only with the Papacy on the receiving end this time and use artillery bombardment to force their surrender. Finally we could try to level the city completely, which will destroy the city completely with explosives followed by razing which will set a useful example in the future and finish off the rebels."
srievola.1280.a: "Capture the City"
srievola.1280.b: "Bombard it"
srievola.1280.c: "Raze it"

srievola.1290.t: "Emmanuel recognized as leader of Catholicism"
srievola.1290.d: "The Platonic Council, made up largely of former clergy whom are preserving as much of Catholicism as they can and headed by a new pope, have gathered to crown King Emmanuel III the religious leader of the Catholic people, noting that the Church will now be in service to him. Of course the Catholic Church in exile have denounced them as "anti-Pope heretics" and refuse to accept this but it has nonetheless eased concern among some of our more traditional citizens."
srievola.1290.a: "We move further from Kali Yuga"

srievola.1300.t: "Recognize Alchemy"
srievola.1300.d: "With Evola's faith of Tradition gaining increased presence among our state he has begged for us to establish a council of alchemists whom will work to study what he calls "ancient truths that can cast light on our age of darkness". While the King does not believe this he understands that it would gain the favor of the Legion and undermine traditional faith, and keep superstitious citizens fearful of their 'powers'."
srievola.1300.a: "Very well"
srievola.1300.b: "No"

srievola.1310.t: "Rebuild the Colosseum?"
srievola.1310.d: "The Radical Traditionalists have long thought it was nonsense to let the ancient ruins of Rome fall into disrepair, claiming that the this was treating the Roman Spirit as though it was dead when it is still alive but just needs help being revived in our spiritually dead age that denies the divine. A first stop for this would be that symbol of the Roman Empire's greatness and of warrior virtues, namely the Colosseum which they desire to seen rebuilt to its former glory. While it would be expensive there is little question that games hosted there would be popular."
srievola.1310.a: "Fund it"
srievola.1310.b: "Sounds Like a Waste"

srievola.1320.t: "Colosseum Finished"
srievola.1320.d: "The Colosseum has been brought back to its former glory, at least as far as architecture is concerned. To truly reflect Roman values we must allow battle to take place once again! Between prisoners, slaves and volunteers whom desire greatness. This will give those with noble spirits whom happened to be born into a lower caste a chance to demonstrate their true value and gain the recognition they deserve, and will provide the locals with plenty of entertainment as well as a taste for warfare."
srievola.1320.a: "Gladiatorial Games it is"
srievola.1320.b: "Gladiators and Chariots"
srievola.1320.c: "Just hold ordinary events there"

srievola.1330.t: "The King Attends the First Game"
srievola.1330.d: "The King has decided to personally attend the first gladiatorial game with High Chancellor Evola at his side, a battle between a retiarius armed with a net and trident and a murmillo armed with a gladius and a scutum shield. They both fought well, however in the end the murmillo overcame the retiarius, pinning him to the floor with his foot. He then looked to the crowd and saw that nearly half of whom showed their thumbs to symbolize finishing the fallen foe with his sword, while the rest showed compressed fists that hid their thumb to symbolize sparing the man and sheathing the sword. Unsure of what to do he looked to the king to decide."
srievola.1330.a: "He fought well, a compressed fist"
srievola.1330.b: "He should've fought to the end, thumb up" 

srievola.1340.t: "A Champion Emerges"
srievola.1340.d: "In the gladiatorial ring those few whom have the potential to be truly brutal and courageous heroes are separated from the pseudo-masculine lowlifes. One such man, Francesco Calì, has emerged as a champion in the arena, surviving at least 18 games. A former soldier and footballer whom was arrested for being a suspected anti-Legion integralist supporter his Lord now looks upon him with great esteem and lavishly rewards him for his fighting ability. Perhaps it is time to reward him for good by making him a commander of the Legion?"
srievola.1340.a: "Make him a Legion Commander"
srievola.1340.b: "Keep him as a Lavished Fighter"

srievola.1350.t: "Women's Role Enforced"
srievola.1350.d: "The Law of Women's Stature has been passed, effectively meaning that women can no longer work in many industries, own land or choose their own husbands. The patriarch of the family now holds a monopoly on his household though some argue that we should at least allow women to be nurses and, as far as our Occultist followers are concerned, priestesses."
srievola.1350.a: "They may be Priestesses or nurses"
srievola.1350.b: "They are either wives or maids"

srievola.1360.t: "Destroying Materialistic Hedonism"
srievola.1360.d: "With our society establishing the norm of asceticism and fighting for what Baron Evola celebrates as the triumph of Roman values over fatalistic Etruscan ones many of the Knights have begun to sell off valuables that are viewed as overly ornate or comforting and are expecting citizens to do the same. Some of our followers have even begun to raid taverns that are viewed as promoting hedonistic activities that posses no higher spiritual value. This line-of-thinking includes overthrowing the remaining banks, corporations and foreign owned properties that are viewed as disloyal or corrupt and putting them under the Kings domain and destroying utterly useless 'technologies' such as television. All of the collected materials are seemingly going towards the military whenever possible."
srievola.1360.a: "Excellent"

srievola.1370.t: "Racial Laws Ordered"
srievola.1370.d: "The Radical Traditionalists have long believed in a form of spiritual racism, in which blood contains the psychological elements of tradition and provides the life-force for a people. With this racial mixing has been banned and the Aryan-Roman has a clearly higher status than others within our territory. The question now remains of how to treat those of minority ancestry with two proposals given. One is to allow them to organize into their own hierarchies modeled on our values for those whom pledge loyalty to the King, pay tribute, pledge soldiers to our wars and acknowledge the Kings and his Nobles supremacy. This way we can use the best of the aristocratic spirit that exists amongst themselves for our own purposes. Or as Arthur Reghini and much of the Legion have strongly pushed for we could simply place them in our lowest class and let them prove themselves in combat when the time comes."
srievola.1370.a: "Organize their hierarchies... loyal to ours"
srievola.1370.b: "Their rightful place is always beneath us"
srievola.1370.c: "It shall be a case by case basis"

srievola.1380.t: "Corvee System"
srievola.1380.d: "With our attacks on traditional capitalism and encroachment of a Caste system some of our serfs simply do not have the means of providing taxes to the Legion. However this is once again an opportunity to learn from our ancestors rather than institute a crude monetary system by instituting the Corvee System which will replace taxes for those whom can't pay them with required days of government directed labor. Corvees will have greater rights than the class beneath them, the slaves, but nonetheless are required to carry out their work. The labor this will provide us with will also allow our economy to exit the worst that Black Monday caused, for whatever that's worth."
srievola.1380.a: "Consumerist woes will soon be behind us regardless"

srievola.1420.t: "Codreanu accepts"
srievola.1420.d: "As expected the Iron Guard have accepted our offer to join together our forces against the agents of civilizational deterioration. What shall we call our alliance?"
srievola.1420.a: "Legionary Union"
srievola.1420.b: "European Spiritual Axis"
srievola.1420.c: "Roman Alliance"
srievola.1420.e: "Blood Courts Pact"

srievola.1430.t: "Battle for Palermo"
srievola.1430.d: "The battle for Palermo was bloody but finally we have managed to break the rebellion in the city and are now pushing our way into rural hideouts, interrogating any villagers suspected of working with them. With mobsters fleeing the area and rebels being destroyed the region is ours albeit it at a high cost. Nonetheless their loss has helped to demoralize resistance to our regime. But perhaps we should set more of an example?"
srievola.1430.a: "Sicily is now a Legion outpost"
srievola.1430.b: "Sicily is now our serfs"
srievola.1430.c: "Just Purge all whom may be treacherous"

srievola.1440.t: "Esoteric Developments"
srievola.1440.d: "There have long been rumors has to Evola and his closest followers interest in magic and the esoteric but it seems that his views have spread to some of the Nobles and Legion members, whom are now taking an interest in reading his literature and gaining access to books that profess the new faith. Overall they are still a fringe but among those whom believe their support is strong, they practice asceticism and many in the Legion whom are superstituous are shifting towards such views."
srievola.1440.a: "Support them"

srievola.1450.t: "Occult Nobles"
srievola.1450.d: "Seeing our increasing triumph in religious terms, an increasing number of Legion members and are said to be practicing occult rituals for good luck before battle and are growing stricter in their personal belief in and practice of Evola's Occultist Faith of Tradition. Even the Nobility whom follow Evolianism have taken an increasing interest in the faith and its fetishism of them."
srievola.1450.a: "Excellent"

srievola.1460.t: "Superstitious Citizens"
srievola.1460.d: "Most of our citizens know little about the occultism present among much of the Legion and our loyal Nobility but with our growing success and the Religion of Tradition gaining traction at the expense of the Papacy many are beginning to believe in it to some degree, even if it is limited to fearing the magical powers of Evola and his inner circle or simply feeling that loyalty to the papacy is growing increasingly pointless. As such they are less willing to work with the enemy and even the common soldiers pay more respect to the faith despite its demanding nature."
srievola.1460.a: "Wonderful!"

srievola.1470.t: "Primordial Revival"
srievola.1470.d: "The Faith of Tradition has become a true religious minority in our territory and the Kings word now at least rivals that of the Papacy among his followers. With many citizens hoping to appease the forces around them many are performing rituals for good luck and attempting to hex their enemies, and a syncretism of Catholicism and Evolian occultism has grown in prominence. Traditional followers of Catholicism are dismayed at this but are becoming increasingly reluctant to confront it as they are now uncertain of where even their own neighbors sympathies lay."
srievola.1470.a: "As Long as They Don't Hex Us"

srievola.1480.t: "King's Spiritual Power"
srievola.1480.d: "The Papacy's monopoly over our populations spiritual life has finally been broken! The Kings word is followed by a large enough sect of the people, and nearly all of the Legion and Nobility, that he functionally has more influence that the Pope does within our society especially since the Papacy-in-exile has extreme difficulties communicating with their followers here. For those whom believe in the King they would gladly die in battle if he ordered them to."
srievola.1480.a: "May He Live Forever!"

srievola.1490.t: "Dominance of Evolian Tradition"
srievola.1490.d: "We have finally revived the old world! Even though most of the population still holds private sympathies for Traditional Catholicism it has nonetheless been driven underground in favor the Religion of Tradition. Our military fights well knowing that higher powers watch over their every victory, many citizens observe the striptures of the Warrior-Priests out of fear of their powers and the next generation will be far less Catholic than their predecessors."
srievola.1490.a: "Another Victory achieved"

srievola.15000.t: "Prominent Catholic Resistance"
srievola.15000.d: "It appears traditionalist Catholic resistance to our rule has grown."
srievola.15000.a: "Modernist Death Throes"

srievola.15000.t: "Prominent Catholic Resistance"
srievola.15000.d: "It appears traditionalist Catholic resistance to our rule has grown."

srievola.1500.d: "It appears traditionalist Catholic resistance to our rule has grown."
srievola.1500.a: "Modernist Death Throes"

srievola.1510.t: "Catholic Rebellion"
srievola.1510.d: "Our attempts to subvert the power of the church have devolved into riots against our government. We must act now as these devotees of slave morality attempt to subvert an actual transcendence for our people."
srievola.1510.a: "Wipe them from the Earth!"

srievola.1520.t: "Christian Resistance Damaged"
srievola.1520.d: "The Catholic resistance has taken severe blows in recent days and fewer sympathizers to their cause believe they can succeed in destroying us."
srievola.1520.a: "They will need to be instructed further"
srievola.1520.b: "Let's Keep it up"

srievola.1530.t: "Christian Rebels Neutralized"
srievola.1530.d: "The Catholic resistance has at long last finally ceased to be a major threat. Many believe attempting to save the traditional papacy is a lost cause."
srievola.1530.a: "At Long Last"

srievola.1540.t: "Papal States retaken"
srievola.1540.d: "While our methods are not without controversy Rome is nonetheless ours again after a mighty holy battle between the Legion and the modernist-wing of Catholicism."
srievola.1540.a: "An example is set"

srievola.155.t: "Sicily wants an alliance"
srievola.155.d: "Citing our shared national-mysticism and enemies the [SRI.GetName] under King Emmanuel and Chancellor Evola desire an alliance with us."
srievola.155.a: "Of course"
srievola.155.b: "No"

srievola.1560.t: "Pan Europa organized"
srievola.1560.d: "The age of modernism and chaos is dead and gone as Europe is no longer run by either slaves or merchants but by its best! Our victory is final and eternal with all our remaining foes trembling at the sight of the Legion that remains fanatically loyal, and apart of, The New Order. What shall we call ourselves?"
srievola.1560.a: "Pan Europa"
srievola.1560.b: "The Aryan-Roman Imperium"
srievola.1560.c: "Our current name suits us well"

srievola.1570.t: "The Return of Rome"
srievola.1570.d: "We have retaken the lands of Italy from the socialists, Republicans, pretender kings and Papacy. With our power undeniable and our revival of the ancient spirit we can at last give Rome the dignity it deserves and continue its legacy under its name. But which would be most appropriate?"
srievola.1570.a: "Kingdom of Rome"
srievola.1570.b: "Roman Empire"
srievola.1570.c: "Third Rome"

srievola.1580.t: "Merchants beg for an exception"
srievola.1580.d: "As apart of our battle against the encouragement of pointless softness that modern technology promotes most civilian vehicles are being taken by the Legion. However the Mercantilist class begs to have an exception made for them, noting they need these vehicles to move wares. While they are already being allowed to keep a handful of trucks Legion inspectors say is absolutely needed for supply they argue it would be more efficient for the economy if they let them keep more of their vehicles."
srievola.1580.a: "Very Well"
srievola.1580.b: "No Exceptions"

srievola.1590.t: "Rome demanded"
srievola.1590.d: "The Papacy knew it was only a matter of time before the madness that has possessed Sicily came for them, especially after they moved to limit their influence in the region. We have received a demand to give up our capital under threat of war by those bastardos Emmanuel and Evola! However with socialist resistance still present from the fall of the SRI many advisors are claiming we do not stand a chance and that leaving them Rome is the lesser of two evils while we evacuate clerics from the area. However others are claiming that Evola is a pagan and that we should go down fighting. What shall we do?"
srievola.1590.a: "Surrender"
srievola.1590.b: "We have God on our side! Fight!"

srievola.1600.t: "Papacy Caves In" 
srievola.1600.d: "Squeezed by enemies on all sides the Papacy decided it would be better to evacuate many of their bureaucrats and surrender the region to Victor Emmanuel III, a known longtime enemy of the church, rather than lose everything in a pointless war. However they still encouraged Catholics to resist the regime on the way out. Nonetheless it appears both Emmanuel and Evola have triumphed over their old for." 
srievola.1600.a: "Finally!"

srievola.1610.t: "The King and The Baron" 
srievola.1610.d: "It appears as though the bond between King Emmanuel III and his High-Chancellor, Baron Julius Evola, has grown in recent months. The two hold many shared opinions on the King's powers and dignity, on culture and on the proper way of living ones life and both often unite in their hatred of the Catholic Church, liberals, socialists, politicians, progressives, democratic conservatives, Bourbons, anti-colonialists, republicans, "soft" men, insubordinate women and hedonists. Hunting trips, fishing and hiking are an increasingly common past-times for the two as they review stately material and has shifted the King into accepting even more right-wing positions than he hold before."
srievola.1610.a: "A Model Friendship"

srievola.1620.t: "The King's Passing" 
srievola.1620.d: "To the great pain of the Legion and especially to his close political ally Julius Evola, King Victor Emmanuel III has passed on due to a heart attack. He will be entombed in the capital while his son, Umberto II, takes the throne with Evola remaining his advisor."
srievola.1620.a: "Long Live Umberto II!"

srievola.1630.t: "Legion Sympathies" 
srievola.1630.d: "We have established fruitful relations with the Romanian Iron Guard, with a handful even being sent over to help us stabilize the situation. They have already agreed to our idea for a defensive alliance, something more of our advisors support as it will still allow us to be flexible in our foreign policy. Most legionaries would prefer an outright alliance led by Two-Siciles but our advisors are claiming we simply would not have the strength to fight all of our enemies between just the two of us and a defensive alliance is more practical."
srievola.1630.a: "A Defensive Alliance"
srievola.1630.b: "To hell with compromise, make an outright alliance!"

srievola.1640.t: "The Black Prince"
srievola.1640.d: "While the Papacy evacuated the Pope and bureaucrats to stay weary of the King its attempts to dissolve all of its military and navy so that it would not fall into the hands of Evola were less than successful thanks to the intervention of Junio Valerio Borghese, AKA the Black Prince. An aristocrat and ultra-rightist, Borghese was a Papal admiral whom secretely harbored strong Evolian sympathies and founded a small cell of officers whom decided that if the Papacy evacuated they would stand by Rome and, therefor, the King of Savoy. The cell volunteered to stay behind to secure the evacuation and once they had left told the military and navy they were now in the services of the Nation. A true Warrior and hero, the Black Prince shall be made an admiral of repute for his loyalty despite the Catholic Church's hatred of him, whom are now doing all they can to convince the populace this "treachery" was planned in conjunction with the House of Savoy."
srievola.1640.a: "A Great Man"

srievola.1650.t: "The Black Prince"
srievola.1650.d: "While the Papacy evacuated the Pope and bureaucrats its attempts to dissolve all of its military and navy so that it would not fall into the hands of Evola were less than successful thanks to the intervention of Junio Valerio Borghese, AKA the Black Prince. An aristocrat and ultra-rightist, Borghese was a Papal admiral whom secretely harbored strong Evolian sympathies and founded a small cell of officers whom decided that if the Papacy evacuated they would stand by Rome and, therefor, the King of Savoy. When war broke out he commanded his navy to withhold attacking whenever possible and as soon as possible handed them over to Two-Sicilies rather than evacuate them as ordered. Considered by the Legion a true Warrior and hero, the Black Prince shall be made an admiral of repute for his loyalty despite the Catholic Church's hatred of him."
srievola.1650.a: "A Great Man"

srievola.1660.t: "Prominent Catholic Resistance"
srievola.1660.d: "It appears Catholic and conservative resistance to our rule has grown."
srievola.1660.a: "Modernist Death Throes"

srievola.1670.t: "Christian Resistance Damaged"
srievola.1670.d: "The Catholic resistance has taken severe blows in recent days and fewer sympathizers to their cause believe they can succeed in destroying us."
srievola.1670.a: "They will need to be instructed further"

srievola.1680.t: "The Insult"
srievola.1680.d: "Count Paolo Ignazio Maria Thaon di Revel is a high-ranking count, longtime Legion member and loyal absolute monarchist whom, unbelievably, has been insulted by a younger Legion member whom has called his competetance into question and bragged he could do his tasks far better. It appears the Count heard about this and as a known champion fencer has requested the chance the duel the young man to the first blood or, failing that, the death. There is no question the Count would win and Evola has advised the King to allow it for the King's time is too important to micromanage every petty dispute of honor among the upper-class and that duels will encourage a culture of "truth, bravery and honor". More cautious on-lookers think the King should let his Court of Advisors simply settle these types of disputes themselves when the King does not have the time or desire to manage them."
srievola.1680.a: "Allow Dueling"
srievola.1680.b: "No Duels, the council will settle it"

srievola.1690.t: "Peasants Revolt Suppressed" 
srievola.1690.d: "In the capital of Calabria, Catanzaro, some of the serfs had yet to fully accept their place in the New Order and under the inspiration of an anti-Evolian poet named Filippo De Nobili decided revolt was their best chance, hoping it would inspire others to destroy our most Noble Beings. This failed of course but due to our reputation they decided to fight to the last man and women which made it especially costly to us, with the event already being called the Pillage of Catanzaro. More pressingly however the revolt only seemed to get out of hand because local soldiers decided to retreat instead of fighting them as ordered by their legionary commanders! We will need to set a precendent to make sure this does not happen again. The most popular proposal is to revive the Roman practice of decimatio, in which all of the disobedient soldiers will draw from a lottery and the ten percent who get the "losing straws" will be beaten to death by their comrades. Less popular proposals include leaving it in the hand of the commanders of themselves at the cost of the King's authority or wiping out every coward which, while tempting, would cost us much cannon fodder in our war against socialism. Of course this will also be setting a precedent for the future." 
srievola.1690.a: "Decimatio it is"
srievola.1690.b: "Leave it up to the commanders"
srievola.1690.c: "Get rid of them all"

srievola.1700.t: "Fall of Piedmont"
srievola.1700.d: "The bastion of so-called Italian syndicalism is in our hands, demonstrating the superiority of our moral fiber. We must finish off our ultimate enemies while we can, namely the syndicalists whom destroy our flesh with their weapons and (even more dangerously) the "Christian Socialists" whom seek to destroy our Spirit through their disgusting advocacy of egalitarian-pacificism." 
srievola.1700.a: "Socialism here is finished"

## Mafia ##

mafia.1.t: "Mafia attacks"
mafia.1.d: "The Mafia, which is primarily based in the south has spread their operations northwards in an attempt to weaken our state. However, the initial intent of spreading their connection has grown into a full-scale mission to destroy law and order throughout Italy. This has been achieved through wide-scale attacks by the Mafia, who’s means include the assassination of high-raking officials, strategic destruction of infrastructure and the spreading of wide-scale corruption networks. "
mafia.1.a: "They're seriously a problem"

mafia.2.t: "An offer from the [SRI.GetName]"
mafia.2.d: "The forces in the South of Italy have sent us a formal offer to join their Axis of Bosses. Should we accept, we do have similar goals, and forming a formal alliance with them would benefit us both. "
mafia.2.a: "Quite the proposal!"
mafia.2.b: "We'll have to pass"

mafia.20.t: "An offer from the [SRI.GetName]"
mafia.20.d: "The forces in the South of Italy have sent us a formal offer to join their Axis of Bosses. Should we accept, we do have similar goals, but making a formal alliance with the Mafia would be damaging to our Socialist cover. "
mafia.20.a: "Quite the proposal!"
mafia.20.b: "We'll have to pass"

mafia.3.t: "The [LEC.GetName] Passes"
mafia.3.d: "We have received a formal reply from the [LEC.GetName], saying that while we share similar goals, we will not embark in a formal alliance. "
mafia.3.a: "Too bad."

mafia.30.t: "The [CSA.GetName] Passes"
mafia.30.d: "We have received a formal reply from the [CSA.GetName], saying that while we share similar goals, we will not embark in a formal alliance. "
mafia.30.a: "Too bad."

mafia.4.t: "We have Unified Italy"
mafia.4.d: "We have finally defeated the forces of the North. Now the iron fist of the Mafia extends throughout all of Italy, yet the fate of Italy still remains unclear. The main question that looms over our government is the fate of the Pope, who acted as the North’s nominal Head of State. Due to our catholic faith nobody wants to bring harm to the Pope, and many consider giving the Pope his state back while we control the Italian Federation from the shadows. This would keep our operations localized to the South, where we exert a higher degree of control. Others however think that we should proclaim a new Italian state under our rule and send the Pope to rule over his own fiefdom in Rome. "
mafia.4.a: "Give the Pope free reign."
mafia.4.b: "Send the Pope to Rome and proclaim a new Italy!"

mafia.5.t: "Ensuring Loyalty"
mafia.5.d: "The Mafia’s iron grip over the South of Italy is almost uncontested, yet a brave few still dare to oppose us. Several local towns still stand up to our protection rackets, and Socialist and Fascist strongholds resist our rule. Luckily, these are nothing but inconveniences to us, as we can easily send in our forces both in the Mafia and National Army to crush these rebels. "
mafia.5.a: "As Expected."

mafia.6.t: "The Gears of State"
mafia.6.d: "In our lands, corruption is no longer a problem to be rooted out by a noble few, it is both a means and a way of life. The Government is corrupt on every single level, with every cop, representative and judge being on our payroll, and every political party in the area being loyal to us. \n\n The bedrock of our state is now corruption, ingrained in every part of Italian society. It can no longer be destroyed or challenged. Getting rid of corruption would be paramount to getting rid of the entire state. "
mafia.6.a: "And why would we?"

mafia.7.t: "The Banks are made of Marble"
mafia.7.d: "Banks, the centres where the wealthy have stored their wealth for centuries. But now, with the Mafia controlling all assets of state, the nation’s banks have adjusted to the new and illegitimate way of life. This has led to banks serving a new purpose for the Mafioso command; wide-scale money laundering. With these new corrupt banks, we can take any illicitly acquired funds and easily clean them of their dirty origins and allow them to return to the outside and legal economy. \n\n Banks that have refused to comply with the new standards have often had their owners winding up dead. "
mafia.7.a: "More Money for us."

mafia.8.t: "Back in Sicily"
mafia.8.d: "While the original home of the Mafia is in Sicily, situation has forced us to spread northwards. Of course, this thinning of our forces in Sicily has given a select group of rabble rousers the idea to defy our rule and refuse our rackets. Luckily though, our rule in Sicily is as strong as ever. And the ones who defied were promptly put in their place.\n\n Indeed, in Sicily our word is law, in Sicily our control is absolute, and in Sicily we can do anything we want.\n\n Our roots are in Sicily, and our home will always be in Sicilys"
mafia.8.a: "Our Stronghold."

mafia.9.t: "The Entente Denounces us!"
mafia.9.d: "Despite the fact that the Entente is friendlier to us than the old Socialist Republic that was once on our soil, they still are far from our friends. And now, they are anything but, as the French Government in Algiers has officially denounced us and placed our nation under embargo. This would seriously hinder our ability to do business, however we can easily outrun their blockade or simply use other routes. However, a suggestion to get this embargo lifted is to make an offer to the Entente. This offer would allow the Entente forces to use the Isle of Sardinia as a launching pad to reclaim Europe, something that the Entente would surely accept given their position. "
mafia.9.a: "Bastards."
mafia.9.b: "Perhaps we could come to an understanding."

mafia.10.t: "All at a Price..."
mafia.10.d: "Luxury is something that has always been associated with Italian goods. When the wealthy look for quality, they turn to Italy, no matter the product. And of course, the Mafia helps with that. Any imaginable good can be found in our lands, and if it exists then we can typically make it better than anyone else can. From narcotics to cars to fashion to wine, Italy makes it better than anyone else. \n\n Of course, some of our products are more addictive than others. The elite classes across the world have gotten hooked on our drugs and have bankrupted themselves in the process. Of course, we all know what happens to people who don’t pay. "
mafia.10.a: "Better pay up."

mafia.11.t: "Our Contracts"
mafia.11.d: "Another industry the Mafia is spreading its roots in is construction. These front construction companies are gaining lucrative contracts both at home and abroad through no legitimate means. However, with our construction forces being stretched, the question is beginning to arise. Should we focus our efforts on projects at home or gain more contracts abroad. "
mafia.11.a: "Focus on Home."
mafia.11.b: "Focus on Abroad."

mafia.12.t: "High-Profile Assasinations"
mafia.12.d: "Major opponents of the Mafia have a tendency of ending up dead, this is just as true as ever. High-profile opponents of the Mafia have faced assassination through many means, such as car bombings, sniper attacks, simple attacks, abductions and many more means. While the government claims that these are nothing but accidents, most people know the truth that these assassinations are the work of the Mafia. Of course, that is the price of opposing our will. "
mafia.12.a: "Nothing but Accidents."

mafia.13.t: "An offer from the Mob"
mafia.13.d: "After the embargo against the Mafioso state in Southern Italy, the majority of our government expected the usual threats of retaliation. However, the Mafia has sent no threats, and instead has sent an offer. This offer would allow us military access to Sardinia if the embargo is lifted. While this offer is tempting, many ponder if it is worth giving the Mafia free reign over the Mediterranean. "
mafia.13.a: "Accept."
mafia.13.a: "Not a chance."

mafia.14.t: "The Illicit State"
mafia.14.d: "Cloaked in the shadows Southern Italy lies. As corrupt and seedy as the day is long, the Naples-Sicily region prospers in untold wealth, the Mafia controlling every facet of life. Corruption is engrained in the state, Protection Rackets are as accepted as taxes, and the government freely sells narcotics to its own citizens; fueling an addiction that only lines the pockets of corrupt commissars and bureaucrats. The Black Market and the legal economy have moulded into one, and Italy has become a world hub of less than legitimate business. \n\n In untold wealth Italy prospers, with morality and the law holding no place in the affairs of the state."
mafia.14.a: "Wonderful."

mafia.15.t: "An Invitation from the Axis of Bosses"
mafia.15.d: "The head of the Axis of Bosses has sent a delegation to our operation seeking to discuss a promising arrangement. The Don’s associates offer a spot in the secretive and shadowy Axis of Bosses, an international cabal of crime bosses and slumlords that seek to cooperate in order to benefit our shared dubious business. Side by side, we could stay out of each other's operations as we seek to expand in a united fashion, bringing greater honor and profit to our gangs, though we would have some competition that we could not just simply wipe away as before. Divided, we may fall to law enforcement and forces of order and so-called justice, but together, we may just be able to survive this turbulent time on a wave of profit and opportunity. What is our answer?"
mafia.15.a: "We open our arms to this Boss of Bosses."
mafia.15.b: "Our enterprise stands alone. We have no need to weaken our own syndicate."

#Catholic ISIS events
cathitaly.1.t: "Neo-Sanfedisti Activty"
cathitaly.1.d: "Recently, we have received several reports of Neo-Sanfedisti activity. This reactionary militia has been plaguing us since the Revolution began. Their movement began after one of our more radical militias led a controversial attack on San Giovanni Rotondo. Terrified of our Revolution, these Catholic extremists banded together to form militias of their own, and have been causing trouble in the rural areas ever since. The group seems to be incredibly disunited,  only united by a Leadership Council that is otherwise powerless. Despite the massive disunity, two men, Padre Renato Ziggiotti and Padre Pio are the most popular leaders within the NeoSanfedisti. The former dreams of restoring a reactionary order to Italy, unifying it in some “Holy Federation.” Pio, for his part, is more radical; The ideas of nation, class, race, and ideology disgust him. He wishes to topple our Republic and build a society united by faith. Despite this activity, it is not uncommon for the New Army of Holy Faith to vanish for months at a time and reappear either when we are at our weakest, or when our so-called anti-Catholicism is at it's strongest."
cathitaly.1.a: "Terrorists stuck in the past."

cathitaly.2.t: "The Future of the Neo-Sanfedisti"
cathitaly.2.d: "With our Army becoming increasingly more divided, it was decided the Council would hold a vote on its future leadership and path. Initially, many candidates came forward with their plans, but over time it became very clear that it would either be either Padre Ziggiotti or Padre Pio’s ideas that won the day. Ziggiotti gave a rousing speech about the glorious new Italy we could build together, how we would rebuild Italy into a perfect, Holy nation, ruled by Piety and Devotion to the Lord. As his speech drew to a close, almost the entire room was filled with furious applause. Once it died down, Pio carefully stood up and began to speak. Immediately, his soothing voice and mystical aura seemed to transfix the room. He spoke about his dream of a society united by faith, of brothers and sisters coming together in harmony and love. He called for dismantling the nations and systems that keep us from being one in Christ Jesus. When he concluded, there was no applause, only awe. The debate has concluded, and though only God knows what the future holds for our movement, it is time for the Council to decide who will be our new leader."
cathitaly.2.a: "The faithful Padre Ziggiotti has won the day!"
cathitaly.2.b: "The visionary Padre Pio is given the reins."

cathitaly.3.t: "Padre Ziggiotti's Plan"
cathitaly.3.d: "Padre Ziggiotti has a dream. He has been quested by the Lord to rebuild Italy into a new, Holy Federation. The plan calls for the return of the nobility, but not before land reform to ensure the people are not to be abused by the aristocracy. At the same time, he has pledged compensation to the nobles whose land will be donated to the peons. Once complete, he plans to approach the North in the hopes of a reunion. But if diplomacy were to fail, perhaps his Holy Federation would be one forged in blood..."
cathitaly.3.a: "Thy will be done."

cathitaly.4.t: "Padre Pio's Vision"
cathitaly.4.d: "Padre Pio is a simple man at his core. When he sees a problem, he does all he can to solve it. When he hears confessions, he can read the soul of the penitent, and can tell them how to truly save their souls. Thus it is with the grand problem of humanity. Pio believes he has seen the signs; he knows why the Socialists and Nationalists rose up-he knows why they reject God. They reject God due to not knowing him. They don't know God due to poor catechism. They had poor catechism due to the distractions of nation, of war, and of bad examples of the faith.\n How does one fix that? How can you attack the root cause of society's ills? Simple. You remove the nation, race, class. You give a good model of faith to the children. And what after that? Once man is solely focused on God, you will know you have solved the problem.\n This solution, once it is successful in the south of Italy, cannot be held within her borders alone. No, the entire Church must fall and come to embrace this truth, this grand vision of Padre Pio. Once the Church has tasted this vision, Pio's vision will be carried to the four corners of the world, so that he can bring man to his true and most glorious end: life with Christ in Heaven above, forever."
cathitaly.4.a: "Don’t allow the sad sight of human injustice to sadden your soul; someday you will see the unfailing justice of God triumph over it!"

cathitaly.5.t: "Those Who Still Fight"
cathitaly.5.d: "Our army has, by the grace of God, triumphed over the Red Menace. However, our work is not done. The underworld of Italy has been corrupted by the greed and power of the Mafia. They have built a Den of Thieves on the exploitation of the innocent who cannot help themselves. Worse still, they profane our faith while cloaked in the image of the Virgin Maria. Just as Christ drive the materialistic money-changers from His Father’s House, so too must we drive these monsters from the Kingdom of God. At the same time, we face a wicked, ancient threat. Julius Evola and his Legions are a relic of the cruel past that Christ saved man from. We cannot let this new army of Nebuchadnezzar devastate God’s Earth with their philistine ideas of supremacy, nation, and idol-worship. We must defeat this abominable force as the Son of Man conquered the pagans of old!"
cathitaly.5.a: "Onward Christian Soldiers!"

cathitaly.6.t: "Dealing with the Mafia"
cathitaly.6.d: "At last, we have liberated Italia from the grip of the crooked mafia. While we certainly must defang the Syndicate, there remains debate about what to do with the Mafiosos themselves. Some believe their sinful ways of crime, betrayal, and murder put them beyond redemption. After all, they are dangerous men, and the last thing we need is for them to corrupt our ranks with their trickery. Another camp preaches mercy for the monsters. To them, these are our brothers in faith, misguided by worldly greed. If we show them mercy, they could become a powerful ally as well. Did not Jesus show mercy to the tax collector Matthew and the prostitute Mary. Perhaps we should offer these blind men a chance to see?"
cathitaly.6.a: "You cannot love Christ and be a mafioso. We shall send them to the Lord for their judgment."
cathitaly.6.b: "Rejoice! Our brothers were lost and now they are found!"

cathitaly.7.t: "Dealing with Evola's Legion"
cathitaly.7.d: "We cornered the Legion around Bari. Upon luring their army out into the open plains, the modern clash of good and evil began. The Pagan Leviathan fought brutally and desperately, their troops with blackened hearts screaming about degeneracy and “Kali Yuga.” Our warriors were pushed back further from the city, but we did not lose hope. We knew the battle had been won from the very moment Christ sacrificed Himself on the cross. Our men retreated behind our artillery emplacements as the Legionaries surged forward. It was then that the guns roared like the trumpets at Mount Zemaraim. After the devastating barrage, our counter attack began. God was surely with us as we pushed the pagans back to the outskirts of the city. There the leviathan made its final stand. Evola was found in the Basilica of Saint Nicholas, a single gunshot in his forehead. By the justice of God, we have triumphed over the wicked Legion."
cathitaly.7.a: "At last! Italy is free of Evola, Glory be to God!"

cathitaly.8.t: "Hope of Faith"
cathitaly.8.d: "To My Beloved Sister Viola,\nToday I finally heeded your words and attended mass at the Cattedrale di Avellino. Initially I was disgusted by the ritual I was witnessing. As you know, my years in the Socialist Republic had convinced me that the Church and everything to do with it was all puttanata.  After the First Reading, which recounted the Parable of the Sower I had enjoyed when I was a boy, none other than Padre Ziggiotti began the Homily.\n Somehow, I was enthralled by his words. Oh, how he had such a way with words! He told us of the importance of faith, that without it a void is left in our hearts, and creates sorrow and misfortune. Before I had realized what I had done, I interrupted to blurt out, “But Padre, how does one attain and keep the faith?” People from every pew turned to face me with disgusted looks. But Padre Ziggiotti only laughed gently before answering. “My son, faith is attained through our works. We can express faith through our words, but it is our deeds that truly show that we seek and believe. Walk the path of righteousness, and you will find yourself empowered with faith, that wonderful gift. With belief in God by your side, my son, nothing is impossible.”\n To tell you the truth, few words have moved me as much as the ones he spoke before continuing the Mass. I think I have finally become grateful for the baptism Mama and Papa gave me all those years ago. But now I must get back to work. But thank you, Viola, for everything."
cathitaly.8.a: "Yours, Bruno"

cathitaly.9.t: "this event does not exist"
cathitaly.9.d: "you are gay"
cathitaly.9.a: "smh"

cathitaly.90.t: "Approching the North"
cathitaly.90.d: "The Lord has worked through Padre Ziggiotti to liberate Southern Italy from Syndicalism, Materialism, and Esotericism. But our mission is over. Now we must look to the North, for there the heart of the Church lies. It is time we approach the Holy See as Servants of the Lord and His Church, humbly asking for Italy to be reborn as a holy, united federation. Though we expect and pray for a peaceful outcome, Padre Ziggiotti is ready to wage war should the Pontiff be blind to reason."
cathitaly.90.a: "It is time we go to Rome."

cathitaly.10.t: "The South Requests Reunion"
cathitaly.10.d: "A curious proposition has come in from our severed half to the south. Apparently, after the recent turmoil in the southern Republic’s recent elections, the syndicalist dogs have been overthrown, and in the ensuing unrest and panic, revered priest and catholic militant Padre Renato Ziggotti has taken the reigns of the nation in his hands. Backed by his Neosanfedist militias, Padre Ziggotti has returned the mighty light of God to these heathens, basking the south in the Holy Light of the Lord once more! With his rule cemented, he has sent a request of reunion to the Holy See here in the north. Though Padre Ziggotti may have a reputation for violence against the godless syndicalists, he is still a man of the cloth and a true son of God in our eyes, no matter how misguided he may have once been. Shall we accept his offer with open arms, reuniting these blessed lands and restoring the heart of Catholisicm to its rightful strength, or shall we ignore this madman’s request in hopes that we may retake the South at a later date."
cathitaly.10.a: "Our Holy Italy shall stretch from Palermo to Turin, fully bathed in God’s light!"
cathitaly.10.b: "We will not accept the word of this False Prophet!"

cathitaly.11.t: "The North aggrees to join us"
cathitaly.11.d: "God bless us this holy day, for our northern brothers have seen the light! Word has come into Padre Ziggotti’s chambers of the jubilant news that the Holy See to the north has accepted our offer of peaceful reunification. We must make haste at once to begin the preparations for our long awaited reunion. Though the path ahead shall be fraught with danger and trepidation, we shall emerge together on the other side, stronger and more unified than ever before, under the light of God. Italians across the nation may breathe a sigh of relief, for their future has been made brighter than ever before."
cathitaly.11.a: "We move to reunite the halves, making our Faith and People whole once more"

cathitaly.12.t: "The North Refuses"
cathitaly.12.d: "Our northern brothers have sat on high, far above the bustle and squalor the south has been known for for centuries. They have always been the first to snub their nose at us southerners while they grew fat and blasphemous in their debauchery and excess. This dichotomy is dead! Under the guiding hand of Padre Renato Ziggotti, the south of Italy has been transformed into a bountiful and beautiful land that God himself would smile upon! These sinners to the north have denied our humble request at making our broken nation whole again, but this will be the last time the north turns their back on us and on the Lord. Under Padre Ziggotti’s command, our brave Army of the Holy Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ shall storm north like the crusaders of old and wipe clean the slate of these disgraceful heretics. Italy will be made whole once more, and we will spill the blood of our enemies until the streets run red with their sin-filled blood."
cathitaly.12.a: "Even though we march through the valley of the shadow of death, we shall fear no evil, for He is with us"

cathitaly.13.t: "Holy Italy"
cathitaly.13.d: "We have done it! We have completed our holy task and Italy stands whole and united once more. As Padre Ziggotti moves to consolidate the newly made state, the holy light of the Lord washes over these lands, cleansing it of sin and sinner. In this new holy kingdom of God, all will be made pure, and Ziggotti’s Neosanfedisti will make sure of it. As this righteous army stalks our lands, they shall prosthelytize and carry out the will of our Lord, making sure all are made to confess and reconcile their past heresies. This land will be purged of sin, and those who refuse to repent shall feel the blazing light of God to its full extent. We will not tolerate heresy in God’s land."
cathitaly.13.a: "Italy is reborn whole once more, under God’s guiding light and Ziggotti’s firm hand"

cathitaly.14.t: "Catholic Means Universal"
cathitaly.14.d: "Nationalism and Socialism: these concepts, while not down right sinful, are almost idolatry. They corrupt and consume good people with their tempting talk of devotion to nation and revolution. Such concepts have no place in the new society we are building, for devotion is to be reserved for God and His Church. Pio recognizes this, and has begun to take measures to cleanse his realm of these wicked ideas. All clergy, officers and politicans of any rank or stipe even suspected of harboring nationalist or socialist sympathies are to be stripped of their positions. They still have a place in Pio’s vision, but it is certainly not one where they have any influence. The journey to finally be free from that which strays us from God has begun at last."
cathitaly.14.a: "Padre Pio has delivered us from evil!"

cathitaly.15.t: "Attacking Nationalism"
cathitaly.15.d: "With the removal of those suspected to harbor nationalistic or socialist tendencies, the cleansing hand of Pio struck the country. However, this was just the beginning. In order to fully remove that great idol of nationalism, a radical strike must be made. The way to make this strike, in the mind of the great Padre Pio, is twofold. Firstly, the state must be made incredibly decentralized, and all political power will be held by the village in the countryside and in the district within the city. All governmental functions, save for a few powers, namely the military and education, will be handled at the most local level. Doing this will no doubt cause chaos for a short period, but it is necessary to finally remove the idol of nationalism.\n Secondly, national monuments, monuments to the people who united Italy and to the past glories of this nation, must be dealt with. While obviously the people will not take kindly to the destruction of what was, Pio has no intention to destroy these modern day golden calves. They shall be put on display in every town and city in museums and places of shame. This will be done to show our history, for we must not destroy our past, but it will also show the people what we have risen above. In place of the removed monuments, great statues of Our Lord and His Most Blessed Mother, of the blessed Saints, will be raised, to give our people true models to look up to."
cathitaly.15.a: "Always humble yourself lovingly before God and man, because God speaks to those who are truly humble of heart, and enriches them with His gifts."

cathitaly.16.t: "The Chair of Peter"
cathitaly.16.d: "As Padre Pio has begun to implement his glorious vision in southern Italy over the past several months, it is becoming increasingly clear that not only is his vision successful; it works far better then anyone could have predicted. People of all races, classes, and nationalities are working side-by-side, helping each other get to Heaven.\n  His vision has now been proven to be more than just an idea in the head of a visionary, and the second and perhaps most grand phase is about to begin. This phase will involve the implementation of the vision of Pio throughout the entire Church. The only way to achieve that, in the mind of our saintly leader, is to call an Ecumenical Council, a thing only the Holy Father can do. While Padre Pio is a loyal son of Rome, there is no way the current pontiff would entertain Pio's ideas about reform and councils. Thus, our holy Padre has scheduled a meeting with the Vicar of Christ to discuss the reunion of the two halves of Italy, among other things. Padre Pio has his eyes on the Papacy, and with God on his side, how could he fail?"
cathitaly.16.a: "If the Lord wills our success, how could Padre Pio fail?"

cathitaly.17.t: "A Meeting With His Holiness"
cathitaly.17.d: "Padre Pio arrived in at the Papal Palace in Rome at 8am today, and was taken to see His Holiness at 8:30. As Padre Pio knelt to kiss the ring of the Holy Father, the door to the Roman Pontiff's office closed, not to open until 11:30 that night. What the two men discussed for the next 12 hours was not recorded, but the effects of the meeting would be felt early the next morning.\n On the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, the Vicar of Christ announced his resignation. He was the first pope to do so in centuries, and that was not all. In his place, His Holiness declared that no conclave would take place, but that instead, Padre Pio of Pietrelcina, leader of the Apostolic State of Southern Italy, would be the next Bishop of Rome.\n Reactions to this announcement have been... mixed to say the least. The Cardinals of the Church have not issued any statement yet, but a handful of theologians have declared this move illegal. Either way, with Padre Pio now becoming the so-called  “Pope-Elect“, it is expected he will attempt to unite Italy before his coronation."
cathitaly.17.a: "The North must submit to the will of His Holiness!"

cathitaly.18.t: "A Meeting With His Holiness" 
cathitaly.18.d: "Padre Pio arrived in at the Papal Palace in Rome at 8am today, and was taken to see His Holiness at 8:30. As Padre Pio knelt to kiss the ring of the Holy Father, the door to the Roman Pontiff's office closed, not to open until 11:30 that night.

Either way, with Padre Pio now becoming the so-called  “Pope-Elect“, it is expected he will attempt to unite Italy before his coronation."
cathitaly.18.a: "Worrying, either way, we await word from the South"

cathitaly.19.t: "Pio Demands our submission!"
cathitaly.19.d: "As expected, the Apostolic State of South Italy has formally requested that we unite under one government. His Holiness-elect, the nominal head of the Italian Federation, is well within his rights to do this, and by all accounts we are legally bound to follow his request. However, this has not stopped some within our government from begging us to refuse. Pio's state in southern Italy is apparently an abomination of what he is calling 'Nationless Catholicism', a system that, in practice, sees nationalism, socialism, and class conflict as horrible and unites the people under the banner of Catholicism. This comes at the cost of nearly any semblance of modernity. While we are legally bound, the argument of these members of our government is compelling. With this in mind, the College of Cardinals has gathered to hold an emergency vote on what to do in regards to the demand from Pio"
cathitaly.19.a: "He is the rightful Roman Pontiff, we must obey"
cathitaly.19.b: "He may be pope-elect but we are still a nation! We will never submit to this upstart!"

cathitaly.20.t: "The North agrees to join the Apostolic State"
cathitaly.20.d: "Following an emergency vote by the College of Cardinals,  the Italian Federation has agreed to a formal union of our two states, under the guidance of the Pope-elect Pio. With this acceptance, the process of integration can begin at last. Once the Federation has been formally annexed and Rome is within our hands, Padre Pio will finally be crowned Pope."
cathitaly.20.a: "At long last, Italy is reunited!"

cathitaly.21.t: "The North refuses to submit!"
cathitaly.21.d: "Following an emergency vote by the College of Cardinals,  the Italian Federation has refused our offer to reunite peacefully. While this comes as somewhat of a shock to some, it is not so to Padre Pio. This was to be expected in his eyes; the institutional Church has always been afraid of reform, and Pio's reforms would be more radical then most. With this decision being made, the time has come for battle. The men and women of the NeoSanfedisti stand ready to retake the North-they only await the Padre's word."
cathitaly.21.a: "The Die has been Cast"

cathitaly.22.t: "New Government for the Federation"
cathitaly.22.d: "With war between us and the South all but inevitable, the College of Cardinals has deemed it necessary to install a new government in the Italian Federation. After all, it would discredit us to have a Church-led state fighting with the Pope.\n Although many ideas for the new Italian government have been floated, only two, namely reinstating the Monarchy and creating a Republic, have gained enough traction within the College to be considered for implementation. As the last Cardinal casts his ballot and the votes are counted, it is clear that..."
cathitaly.22.a: "...Italy shall be a Kingdom once more!"
cathitaly.22.b: "...Italy shall be a Republic!"

cathitaly.23.t: "The Elevation of Pope-Elect Pio"
cathitaly.23.d: "With Rome now firmly in the hands of Saint Peter's rightful successor, the investiture and coronation of Padre Pio can finally take place. The person to consecrate Pio a bishop is Cardinal Selvaggiani, the dean of the College of Cardinals...\n The consecration of Pio was a simple matter, as in the minds of all, the period of Sede Vacant had gone on long enough. After the ceremony, the Dean of the College was quick to run to the balcony overlooking St. Peter's square and speak those words that the faithful of not just Rome, but the whole world have been waiting for: “Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum, Habemus Papam! Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum, Dominum Francesco Forgione, qui sibi nomen imposuit..."
cathitaly.23.a: "...Leo!”"
cathitaly.23.b: "...Paulus!”"
cathitaly.23.c: "...Gregorius”!"

cathitaly.24.t: "Addressing the Cardinals"
cathitaly.24.d: "“Your eminences, I assure you that I bear no hostility to you. But, my vision is the path we are to follow, and I will beg for your support if I must.” Cardinal Faulhauber spoke first, “[SRI.GetLeader],  I believe I speak for the majority of my fellow Cardinals when I say that our faith in you is shallow. You were not elected by the College. In fact, you have never been one of us. You are an upstart in over your head, and this dream of yours will bring this Church to ruin.” There seemed to be no anger in the Pontiff’s voice as he responded, “Your Eminence, I am to be addressed as Your Holiness. I beg of you to have faith in me and my leadership. I am unorthodox, yes, but I am also nonetheless as faithful a servant of the Lord as any one of you. His Holiness chose me, and thus I am a part of the sacred line that began with Simon Peter. Must I beg you not to split the Church by electing a new Pope?” Now it was Cardinal Baudrillart’s turn. “It is an insult to God to have someone so blasphemous as you lead our Church, and every moment that we do not choose a new Pontiff is another moment we are ruled by a fraud.” The Pope calmly removed the covers on his hands, and revealed his stigmata to his audience. At once, they were silenced, amazed by his wounds and the blood that flowed from them."
cathitaly.24.a: "Thou hast seen me, and thou hast believed."

cathitaly.25.t: "Addressing the Laity"
cathitaly.25.d: "“Brothers and Sisters, I come before you not as the Pontifex Maximus, but as your brother in faith. Brother Nikolić spoke up, “Your Holiness. We are enthused to welcome you into this humble monastery, but some of us still have doubts about this vision of yours and the miracles attributed to you. The Pope smiled warmly, and gently answered, “My Brother, I understand your doubts. But I beg you to keep your faith. All things are possible for one who believes.” Sister Verini, who was paralyzed, was helped to kneel her before her Pontiff. “Your Holiness, the Lord is with you. Blessed be your name! For you are my leader in faith, and I have faith in you.” The Pope removed his mittens, holding up his wounded hands to those before him. Looking upon the wounds of Christ on the Pope’s hands, they were transfixed. He took his hands in hers, and began to say a prayer. “My friends, behold my hands. Sister Verini has not witnessed them until now, and yet, she believed. You doubted until you saw. Now rise, Sister Verini.” Sister Verini stood up, and began to cry tears of joy. At once, they all knelt before him, and begged for forgiveness."
cathitaly.25.a: "For we walk by faith, not by sight."

cathitaly.26.t: "Opening of the Second Vatican Council"
cathitaly.26.d: "Following almost a year of work and preparation, the bishops of the world, or their appointed representatives, now sit together in the Second Vatican Council. The first session of the Council begin with a beautiful three hour long mass prayed  by the Holy Father. In his homily, the Holy Father called on all of those gathered to carry out the business of the Council reverently and quickly. What changes are to come from the Council remain to be seen, but the door to radical change in the Catholic Church is now open, and whether or not His Holiness will push the Council through this door door remains to be seen."
cathitaly.26.a: "The Council is open for business!"

cathitaly.27.t: "The Second Vatican Council is Traditionalist"
cathitaly.27.d: "Deep within the hallowed halls of St. Peter’s Basilica, the Second Vatican Council deliberates over its sacred task. With the initial arguments out of the way, it has been decided to move the Church in a far more traditionalist direction. Championed by the more conservative old guard of the Church Fathers, the Council has agreed that a return to the old ways is best for the Catholic world as a whole. Latin shall be reinforced as the dominant language and script of the Church, while ultramontanism shall be fully embraced, granting His Holiness greater powers than his position has held in centuries. Under the newly strengthened Pope, the Catholic world shall be carried into the future on the back of tradition."
cathitaly.27.a: "We cast away the debauchery of the modern age and return to the old ways"

cathitaly.28.t: "The Second Vatican Council is Moderate"
cathitaly.28.d: "As the esteemed Church Fathers begin their deliberation behind the sealed gates of the Vatican, they have come to an agreement over the general direction of the Second Vatican Council. The wise holy men have come to the agreement to not radically alter the teachings or positions of the Church at all, instead seeking to tow the line and maintain the status-quo. The experiments with the common vernacular shall be allowed to take place, with Latin remaining the dominant and official language of the Church. While a fine balance will be maintained between the fanatics that follow the teachings of  Pope Paul VI and the conservative traditionalists within the Church. Only by maintaining a balance can the Church survive and grace the world with its enlightening aura."
cathitaly.28.a: "We have resisted the temptation of extremism, walking a delicate balance between tradition and reform"

cathitaly.29.t: "The Second Vatican Council is Reformist"
cathitaly.29.d: "Behind the ornate doors of St. Peter's Basilica, the Second Vatican Council was well under way, with the meeting Council Fathers gathering to discuss the future direction of the Catholic Church. After hours of deliberation, these most pious of men have come to an initial agreement on the general direction of this most holy meeting of minds. The Council has voted to realign our ideals along the radical reformist ideas of Pope Gregory XVII, propelling the Church into a new, zealous direction. The Holy Father’s ideals of Catholicism first, above all other creeds and theories, have rung true with the Council Fathers. Under this new direction, worldly ideologies such as syndicalism, capitalism, or nationalism shall be abandoned in pursuit of something far holier and closer to God’s original plan. We shall shed the dividers of race, class, and nation as we spread the light of the Lord across God’s Kingdom of Earth. With Pope Gregory XVII’s teachings forming the bedrock of our new creed, Catholicism shall reign over mankind as the one true faith!"
cathitaly.29.a: "Gregory XVII’s teachings shall lead the Catholic World into a brighter, holier future!"


cathitaly.30.t: "Decree on Freemasonary?"
cathitaly.30.d: "Of all the various heretical movements in history, none have received more papal condemnations then Freemasonary. This is due primarily to the heresy of relativism, among what others would call more conspiratorial reasons. Regardless, several more traditional minded Council Fathers have formally put before our most holy Council a document that boils down every single papal condemnation into one along with some comentary for our modern times. After a short period of debate, the Council Fathers vote and decide that..."
cathitaly.30.a: "...the repeated Papal condemnations are enough, we have no need to waste time with what the faithful already know"
cathitaly.30.b: "...the time has come for a formal Councillor condemnation of Freemasonary"

cathitaly.31.t: "Decree on Capitalism?"
cathitaly.31.d: "From the very beginning of what today has become known as Catholic Social Teaching, Capitalism has lived in a bit of a grey area. While Unrestricted Capitalism has been outright condemn, the other various forms of Capitalism, such as the so-called Social Capitalism and Interventionist Capitalism have not been, leaving many of the faithful confused as to what counts as a moral economic system in the eyes of Holy Mother Church.\n It is with this in mind that a few Church Fathers of a more progressive or reformist bent have put forward for the consideration of the Council a decree that would outline a detailed teaching on the various forms of Capitalism, and would lay out what they have entitled 'Christian Capitalism.' After a period of debate, the Second Vatican Councils votes that...   "
cathitaly.31.a: "...This so called Christian Capitalism is nothing more then socialism in Catholic Clothing! We are duty bound to reject it!" 
cathitaly.31.b: "...Christian Capitalism is the future of Catholic Social Teaching!"

cathitaly.32.t: "End of the Second Vatican Council"
cathitaly.32.d: "After a long period of trials and tribulations, the Second Vatican Council has finally come to end. The Council Fathers have left Rome and returned home, and in their wake have left a Church much different from the one of a short time ago. Regardless of how the Council went, the Catholic Church, at least for the time being, is a buzz with change and a renewed spirit. With his main agenda completed, it is expected of the Holy Father to make some kind of statement regarding what's next for the Catholic Church."
cathitaly.32.a: "We wait with baited breath Holy Father!"

cathitaly.33.t: "Into the World?"
cathitaly.33.d: "The Second Vatican Council has at long last finished their endless deliberations, and a definite path has been set for this holy state and the entire Catholic Church. Under the guidance of the Lord’s holy light, our New Army of Holy Faith shall march out from the lands of the Holy See and spread God’s wisdom and warmth around the world. However, a final question remains on what shall be the nature of the NeoSanfedisti as they carry out the Lord’s good works.\n Our armies can become forces of peace and forgiveness, working with both the clergy and the laity to spread God’s good will to the rest of His misguided flock. Under this mission, we shall take their tired, their poor, their downtrodden, and their bereaved, and we shall lift these meek souls from the mud so they too can inherit the Earth and live in God’s good graces.\n In sharp contrast to this, our armies can march forth from these lands of the Holy See, carrying the vengeful fire and spirit of God’s wrath, smiting the myriad of heretics and heathens that plague this Garden of Eden. Under the command of our brave officers and generals, inspired by the light of the Lord himself, a tenth crusade will be declared; this time, not just for the Holy Land in the Levant, but for all of God’s holy lands. One way or another, we will bring the Church, and the light of Christ to the entire world, so that it touches every single soul, sinner and saint alike."
cathitaly.33.a: ""Deus Vult! The time has come to spread God’s light to every nation on Earth!"
cathitaly.33.b: "The Church will cleanse these lands without needless bloodshed."

cathitaly.34.t: "Choosing a Banner to Rally Our Faith Behind"
cathitaly.34.d: "With Padre Pio’s ascension following the "Papal Crisis", this honored and devoutly pious servant of God has become both the national leader of our beauteous and pristine state, as well as the head of the Christian World and the Catholic Church. With this position, a great deal of pressure has been placed upon His Holiness' shoulders as he takes his seat amid one of the most tumultuous times in modern history. In order to solidify the people’s faith in both their new Pope and their new state, the Pontiff has called for a small meeting to be held to determine the new flag of his hand crafted state. This banner shall be the symbol of our nation and of our faith - something new to rally behind as we walk through this new valley of death towards our bright horizon, guided and shepherded by both Successor of Saint Peter and the Lord’s Holy Light."
cathitaly.34.a: "Rally behind the old naval flag depicting Peter, Paul and Christ."
cathitaly.34.b: "Raise a new banner depicting the Keys of Heaven."
cathitaly.34.c: "The new Peter and Paul flag design shall serve us well."
cathitaly.34.e: "We shall use the Peter, Paul and Christ banner, but modernized."
cathitaly.34.f: "Adorn the standard flag of the Papacy!"
cathitaly.34.g: "Take notes from the Swiss Guard’s standard."
cathitaly.34.h: "Under the watch of the Virgin Mary, our people shall be safe."

cathitaly.36.t: "The Legacy of the Two Sicilies"
cathitaly.36.d1: "As nobles that fled to the north of Italy finally have the chance to return to their former homes in our new state, monarchists amongst our number have proposed enthroning the Bourbons as the heads of our holy state, in the image of our namesakes who fought for the former Kingdom of Two Sicilies. Such a move would surely bolster our legitimacy in the eyes of Italians in the North as well as the South, but numerous protests can already be heard throughout our new state. The already unruly population under us grows restless, as many brand a return to monarchy as a return to the ideals that resulted in our defeat in 1919. After all, we have just recently gained power in the South, and such a move would be reckless. However, our military is confident that they can enforce cooperation amongst the people for the return of the monarchy. How shall we proceed?"
cathitaly.36.d2: "As nobles that fled to the north of Italy return to their former homes in our new state, monarchists among our number have proposed rejoining the Bourbon kingdom in the north, in the image of our namesakes who fought for the former Kingdom of Two Sicilies, and in the process reconcile with the north. A bloodless resolution to the Civil War would surely be the best choice for the Italian nation that has lost so much already, but do we trust the northerners to guide our united nation to prosperity? The tension between North and South is still palpable, with many within our ranks outright decrying the corrupt rule of the North. The Austrian hand slinks deep within Milan and Rome, no doubt. However, the choice is ultimately up to us, though war with the North would likely be wildly unpopular amongst our people."
cathitaly.36.a: "Enthrone the Bourbons, The Two Sicilies live again!."
cathitaly.36.b: "Send an envoy north, the Bourbons shall receive their birthright."
cathitaly.36.c: "We don't need them, our faithful rule alone."

cathitaly.37.t: "Revival of Two Sicilies?"
cathitaly.37.d: "When the Socialists in the South fell to the uprising of the Catholic Neosanfedisti, many wondered what their rise would hold in store for the future of Italy and our Kingdom, but it seems fortune may smile upon us, they have recognized the old Bourbon claim to the Two Sicilies and have extended us an olive branch. They humbly request to continue to have some say in government through representatives and advisors to the King. While this is truly the best outcome, many within our government are wary of allowing such zealous radicals to remain within our administration. But, surely, this is better than spilling the blood of thousands of Italian young men, is it not?"
cathitaly.37.a: "Our birthright is secure!."
cathitaly.37.b: "We cannot trust these fanatics in the slightest."

cathitaly.38.t: "The Restoration of the Two Sicilies"
cathitaly.38.d: "The north has sent back word with approval of the restoration, The Kingdom of Two Sicilies lives and peace in Italy is assured. The North has been reconciled with the South without the slaughter of Italian citizens. Rejoice, for never again will we be divided! Our short-lived independence in the 19th century will last for a thousand years! There will be growing pains, of course, but these pains are better than the pain of thousands of grieving mothers."
cathitaly.38.a: "Viva o rre cu Fagmiglia."

cathitaly.39.t: "The Bourbons rebuke us!"
cathitaly.39.d: "The Bourbon Kingdom of the north has sent back word, they rebuke us, calling us fanatics, zealots and radicals! After such a humble offer, we thought for sure that they would agree to reunification, but it seems that they are more interested in politics than the Italian people. The Austrians have done enough meddling in the North, that they identify more with Vienna than Napoli! We have done all we can. If Italy is to live again, the Northerners must submit to our guidance. Otherwise, we will be slaves to the Hun and Communard for eternity, and the teachings of Christ will be lost. This cannot be! We must secure the sovereignty of our people, even if they resist us."
cathitaly.39.a: "Ca v'abbrucia lu panare!."

cathitaly.40.t: "The Restoration of the Bourbons"
cathitaly.40.d: "The North Italians have decided to restore the Bourbon dynasty, binding their nation to ours under one king. The massive fortifications and bunkers along Rome and Anzio are being dismantled, as our diplomats and administration discuss how to formalize the reunification. Both armies have stood down and are in the arduous process of combining their doctrines and equipment into one Italian army. Families have been reunited, and the whole nation can breathe a collective sigh as Italian has been reunited without further struggle or conflict. The King, [ROOT.GetLeader] has been coronated in Rome, with full support from the Pope. In a speech to Rome, [ROOT.GetLeader], beset by jubilant crowds of people grateful for a new day of stable, optimistic peace, praised both the North and South for seeing the wisdom in pacifism. Celebrations have erupted throughout all of our nation. May we see this peace forever!"
cathitaly.40.a: "Viva o rre cu Fagmiglia."

cathitaly.41.t: "One Kingdom for Italy"
cathitaly.41.d: "Ever since the Socialists fled south of the Italian peninsula, Italy has been divided between 2 administrations, a state of affairs which was maintained even when they were nominally reunited under the House of Bourbon. Safer waters have been reached as the Neosanfedisti has destroyed the rule of the godless Communards in the South. In its stead remained a rule that was more amicable to the North. However, it has come time to mend ourselves into one nation proper, leaving only one gaping question: which ought to take primacy, between the monarchist north and Neosanfedisti south. Representatives of both have met in Rome to discuss the fate of the nation. After days upon days of fiery debate and discourse, who has won the final Italian struggle?"
cathitaly.41.a: "The civilian government takes primacy."
cathitaly.41.b: "The Neosanfedisti come out in triumph."
