rusnik.1.t:0 "Rumours of Nikolai II's Return"
rusnik.1.d:0 "While Russia has resolved to go forth along the noble path to Monarchism and a restored Tsardom, the consensus as to who should lead Russia has been far less cohesive or unified. Factionalism has divided this new pseudo Zemsky Sobor, and for far too long our nation has lived a half-life - an Empire without its Emperor. This has begun to have a noticeable effect on the mental health and morale of the masses, who have begun to lose hope in their government once again. The situation has gotten so bad that peasants across Russia, from the streets of Saint Petersburg to the windswept plains of Siberia, have begun to report sightings of the beloved Nikolai II, who was slaughtered by the Bolsheviks during the Civil War...or so we thought. These phantom sightings are probably nothing more than schizophrenic serfs seeing spectres, haunted by past hopes and grandeurs as the current government further proves its ineptitude. However, there may just be some credence to these sightings, and some have clamored for these strange occurrences to be investigated."
rusnik.1.a:0 "Nothing but nonsense. We know Nikolai is dead!"
rusnik.1.b:0 "Perhaps we should look into these reports, just to humor the masses."

rusnik.2.t:0 "The Return of the Lost Father of Russia"
rusnik.2.d:0 "With our troops and the masses searching far and wide for their lost patriarch, the beloved Nikolai II, the nation has been abuzz, and the current government has been largely ignored as they still fumble and bumble to pick a new Tsar. As this indecisiveness continued to brew chaos, and as the people further began to lose all hope in the ruling regime as they searched for their lost Tsar, a cloaked figure made his way to the capital. \n\nDemanding an audience with the governing body in the Palace Square before the people of the city, the cloaked figure proclaimed himself to be the one and true Nikolai II - both alive and well, though aged considerably. Professing his supposed truth to the city and the regime, it was now up to the people of Russia to decide if they would believe the words of this stranger before them - could he really be the one and true Tsar Nicky, or merely an impostor capitalizing on the murder of our beloved royal family?"
rusnik.2.a:0 "This madman is merely a pretender! Off with his head!"
rusnik.2.b:0 "By the grace of God, Nikolai II has returned from the dead to lead Russia once more!"

rusnik.3.t:0 "The Return of Tsar Nicky"
rusnik.3.d:0 "Accepted by the masses of the capital and beyond, confirming the rumors that have circulated and enchanted this nation, Tsar Nikolai II of the House of Romanov has returned to us, and along with him he has brought with him the surviving royal family. Most prominent of those who have survived is Nicky’s beloved but sickly son Alexi, who has now been thrown into the intensive process of being prepped to be Nikolai’s heir. However, with this return has come the question of who shall reign as the new Tsar. Though most expect Nikolai II to once again take his rightful crown, he has expressed hesitation at this idea, for he has grown old and weary. Though he is willing to take the position if he must, so that he may stabilize the nation as he teaches Alexi how to rule, he has expressed that he would much rather retire from public life now that his duty is done, and allow other, younger candidates vie for the throne instead. The true Romanovs are back, but now we must decide which Romanov will be the one to guide us first into this new future."
rusnik.3.a:0 "God save the Tsar, God save Nikolai II!"
rusnik.3.b:0 "Nikolai II steps down so that a new stock of potential Tsars can vie for the throne."

rusnik.4.t:0 "The Death of Nikolai II"
rusnik.4.d:0 "Despite only ruling for a short time, Nikolai II - the Tsar that we lost that had returned - has finally and truly passed away. A much better end than his believed fate at the hands of the Reds, he passed away in his sleep while surrounded by family and friends alike, and with his beloved, though sickly, son at his side. With his passing, Russia shall enter a new age under Alexi, who has now been crowned as Tsar Alexander IV. May the true Romanov line guide us to prosperity and destiny as we recontinue the legacy robbed from us all those decades ago."
rusnik.4.a:0 "Long live Alexander IV!"

rusnik.5.t:0 "Revenge Against the Impostor"
rusnik.5.d:0 "With the return of the real Romanovs, the existence of the impostor Anastasia - the mentally ill Anna Anderson, or as she is really named Franziska Schanzkowska - has been brought to the attention of our true royal family. Hearing of the existence of such a foul creature - one who would pretend to be his most beloved daughter Anastasia - Nikolai was thrown into a fit of rampage and primal anger. Grabbing his royal sabre and personal Nagant Model 1895 7-shot service revolver, the fuming Tsar left the Winter Palace in a furious hurry, with multiple guards and attack dogs in tow. \n\nRiding out to the home of Anna Anderson - a modest estate on the outskirts of Saint Petersburg provided to her by the pre-coronation regime - Nikolai and his posse surrounded Anderon’s residence and began to set it alight, seeking to flush the impostor out. As the dacha began to burn, the false Anastasia ran out of the inferno - right into the field of fire for Nikolai and his men. Before she could even utter a word of shock or protest, gunfire erupted from every angle, barraging the foul and venomous liar in a hail of lead and gunsmoke. \n\nAfter every soldier had expended their brought ammunition, Nikolai himself walked up to the bloody pulp that was once Anna Anderson, and used his royal sabre to slice off her head as he allowed his hounds to eat upon her flesh before once more riding off, back to the Winter Palace where they came. As they rode off, the dacha collapsed into ashes and cinders as the circling goshawks landed upon her corpse to eat the remains before the wolves came to devour the rest, finally freeing Russia from the delusions of the false Anastasia."
rusnik.5.a:0 "A fitting end for the crazy bitch."

POLITICS_NICHOLAS_II_DESC:0 "Returned to his rightful throne after decades in exile and hiding, Nikolai II Alexandrovich Romanov once again reigns as the Tsar of all Russias. Also known as Saint Nicholas the Passion-Bearer in the Orthodox Church, and as the Father of All Russians to his adoring masses, Nikolai, or Nicholas as he is more commonly called in the West, escaped certain death at the hands of Reds with the rest of his family, though how is not really known, for he keeps this secret close to his chest at all times. Regardless of his secrecy, his age, and his past mistakes, Nikolai II is ready to restabilize his nation and restore the people’s faith in Imperial rule while also preparing his sickly son Alexei the Tsarevich for the throne. In his hands, Russia will finally know peace and prosperity."
POLITICS_TSAR_ALEXI_DESC:0 "Taking the reins of the nation away from his aged father, Alexei Nikolaevich has risen to be the one, true Tsar of Russia. Taking the regal name of Alexander IV, the once sickly and weak boy has transformed himself into a confidant and sound, although still just as sickly, man ready to rule his nation with both iron fist and velvet glove. Taught the ways of rule from his beloved father Nikolai II as well as his adoring family and doting courtesans, Alexei has finally achieved the destiny robbed from him all those years ago, and is now ready to guide Russia and his people into a new golden age under his imperial splendor."
