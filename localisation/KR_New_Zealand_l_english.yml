NZL_first_labour_victory:0 "First Labour Government"
NZL_first_labour_victory_desc:0 "Prime Minister Savage has ridden the waves of his popularity to the fruits of victory this election season, as it appears that New Zealand has put it's faith in the man who promises to give forth a caring hand in this time of economic rut."
NZL_legislate_compulsory_unionism:0 "Legislate Compulsory Unionism"
NZL_legislate_compulsory_unionism_desc:0 "New Zealand will not be taken for a fool by conniving monopolists like so many other countries have, thus we shall mandate our work force to be in a union so our working men can be educated in their basic rights and entitlement for the sweat they expend in our country's service."
NZL_establish_proper_unemployment_relief:0 "Establish a Proper Unemployment Relief"
NZL_establish_proper_unemployment_relief_desc:0 "New Zealand workers have been left to their own devices to survive after the stock market crash, and having a permanent state of soup kitchens just will not do. The Labour party will grant monetary relief to these downtrodden men in these times, giving them a raft in this rocky sea."
NZL_raise_education_support:0 "Raise Support for Universal Education"
NZL_raise_education_support_desc:0 "What cruel world is it that a man shall not be given the ability to raise himself up just because of his placement in the societal and economic ladder. All men of Aotearoa shall be given the chance to go to a university and advance themselves into higher fields."
NZL_massive_social_housing_expansion:0 "Expand Housing Projects"
NZL_massive_social_housing_expansion_desc:0 "From the homeless in Wellington, to even our Maori brothers forced to live upon the prairie without more than a tent, we must provide shelter to all of our isle. Let not a single New Zealander go without a home he can call his own!"
NZL_pass_worker_compensation:0 "Workers Compensation Ensured"
NZL_pass_worker_compensation_desc:0 "If a man who is helping build our nation injures himself in the process, what would it seem for us to leave him helpless? If they shed blood and bone for our nation, we shall ensure they are paid back with compensation for the workman's injuries."
NZL_worker_based_arbitration:0 "End the Arbitration Betrayal"
NZL_worker_based_arbitration_desc:0 "The previously practiced method of Arbitration was abandoned by uncaring governance decades ago, betraying our workers and preventing them appealing to their fellow man when the boss upstairs was cruel. We must give them a say once more, by allowing Arbitration to make a long awaited return."
NZL_industrial_efficacy_bill:0 "Industrial Efficiency Bill"
NZL_industrial_efficacy_bill_desc:0 "New Zealand is still blighted with grimy factories, less than spectacular conditions on the work floor, and the ensuing lack of product this archaic and blast to the Victorian past this system produces. We must overhaul our factories into a more modern and flat out human grid."

### Labour 2

NZL_second_labour_victory:0 "Second Labour Government"
NZL_second_labour_victory_desc:0 "Labour has once more earned the popular mandate to govern this isle, and as such, we begin the effort of moving into the Premier Residence and establishing our office for governance once more."
NZL_universal_super:0 "Implement Universal Superannuation"
NZL_universal_super_desc:0 "To prevent such a woeful market crash like the banks failing ever again, we should turn from them, and instead look to having people guard their own retirement by putting funds into a government operated superannuation, where the people can rest knowing that we would never let their future's collapse on them."
NZL_expand_taxes_war:0 "Expand War Taxes"
NZL_expand_taxes_war_desc:0 "New Zealand's industry takes tremendous effort to convert towards producing for prolonged military endeavors, thus we must request from the people, just as much effort funding such transition and production for the war effort."
NZL_maori_social_and_economic_act:0 "The Maori Social and Economic Advancement Act"
NZL_maori_social_and_economic_act_desc:0 "Our Maori allies in Labour and related organizations are still feeling under-represented, even by our party promises and united front representation. We must give them a practical win, by pushing towards a bill that will fund their advancement in society."
NZL_backbench_revolt:0 "Pass Party Reforms"
NZL_backbench_revolt_desc:0 "The backbench revolt is resulting in our party unable to properly pass legislation, as we cannot even vote as a unified bloc. We will have to look into giving them some concessions for their demands, in order to unify the party before the coalition out votes us."
NZL_conscription:0 "Justified Conscription"
NZL_conscription_desc:0 "Some government's cruelly send off their sons to die in an unpopular war, fought by elites. We look down upon such dull bloodshed of one's own countrymen, however the need of our army for men is dire, so we will have to bite back our worry and draft the best and most fit to outfit our army."
NZL_create_the_minimum_wage:0 "Create a Minimum Wage"
NZL_create_the_minimum_wage_desc:0 "How can any citizen hope to buy a better home, or even feed and clothe themself if they are not given proper wages? We will have to push forth a minimum wage to ensure all workers are given compensation for their labour, even if the owners swear upon us."

### Labour 3

NZL_third_labour_victory:0 "Third Labour Government"
NZL_third_labour_victory_desc:0 "Our continued domination of New Zealand politics shows that it pays to care for the people, and in return, the people will care for us. We once more move into our office's and parliament spots, and this time we must fight to keep our reign secure."
NZL_seize_party_reins:0 "Party Room Schemes"
NZL_seize_party_reins_desc:0 "With dominance over all other parties in the parliament, we must ensure our great gains in progress are not tossed to the wind by other parties' growth. Thus we must plan amongst ourselves on how we can take the seats of each MP into Labour's control, and keep out coalition votes from ever reaching the floor"
NZL_debt_free_currancy:0 "Left Social Credit Theory"
NZL_debt_free_currancy_desc:0 "It was always an ideal to distribute necessities and perhaps even luxury to those who cannot afford such goods. But this was propped up by radicals who let their own vision leave out the truly downtrodden peoples that might not fit with their values. Here in New Zealand, we will make the dream a reality, fixing the wrongs done by such programs before."
NZL_abolish_the_country_quota:0 "Abolish the Country Quota"
NZL_abolish_the_country_quota_desc:0 "The Country Quota has always violated the ideal of one person holding one vote, instead it was always a prize given to the rural communities that voted for the coalition, giving them unwarranted power for smaller representation. Labour shall do away with this blatant spoils system, and move toward true democracy manifest."
NZL_repeal_head_tax:0 "Repeal the Head Tax"
NZL_repeal_head_tax_desc:0 "We have been separated from Australasia for nearly a decade now, yet some of it's archaic laws still linger on us, including a Head Tax on any Chinese immigrants coming to our land, even those who offer up working for a home. We shall repeal such unjust taxation that keeps out asylum seekers."
NZL_peace_time_conscription:0 "Peacetime Conscription"
NZL_peace_time_conscription_desc:0 "We dread sending our boys into fights that they may not come back from, and thankfully the risk to life and limb has decreased in the world somewhat. However, we have such a small manpower pool, we will need to keep conscription in place just to ensure our isle is guarded in peacetime."

### legion 1

NZL_the_legion_takes_hold:0 "The Legion Takes Hold"
NZL_the_legion_takes_hold_desc:0 "Disillusioned by the lack of effort on part of the Coalition parties, the people of New Zealand have turned towards the Legion and Begg to carry them forth from this depressive rut. Despite being given their mandate, our party is heavily divided between Keynesians, Non-Interventionists and Social Creditors on how our economy should be run. We will have to find a path forward with such differing opinions in our big tent."
NZL_divide_the_country_into_shires:0 "Divide into Regional Shires"
NZL_divide_the_country_into_shires_desc:0 "In order to diffuse the burning fuse that is ignited within our tent party, we should fully endorse giving power to the people that elected us in, thus allowing them to make their own decisions. Down all the way to the individual shire will they decide their own hand and thus the people who elect their officials, shall also be the ones who thereby elect how their economy is run in that region."
NZL_expand_membership:0 "Mass Party Expansion"
NZL_expand_membership_desc:0 "Begg has turned an organization of nothing into something of near grandeur in its size alone, even if it blurred the lines of unity of purpose. That strive will not end here, for with our victory, we shall extend a velvet hand to those acceptable Labour and Coalition members who can join the Legion, and democratically lead their shire power bases in a similar fashion to the rest of the legion's individualist thought."
NZL_lazefair_faction_victory:0 "Laissez-Faire Economics Embedded"
NZL_lazefair_faction_victory_desc:0 "How can a man born in Auckland know what's best for a man in Queensland? Only a fool of a chair would try and put a steel reign over regions he has never entered, and thus, our government shall take a hands off approach to how separate shire's direct themselves. Even a good hearted shepard can lead the pack into a wolf's den if it does not know it's herd."
NZL_social_credit:0 "Social Credit Solutions"
NZL_social_credit_desc:0 "All across the Anglo rooted countries on this fair earth, many academics discuss how best to care for the nation's populace when all are hurting in this modern market. Here in New Zealand, our members discuss how best to care for the downtrodden, and distributism has propped its head as a solution to this crisis. Those forgotten and left in the dirt shall be propelled forth into the middle class by our hand."
NZL_kaynesian_faction:0 "Keynesian Interventionism"
NZL_kaynesian_faction_desc:0 "Evan Perry, our economic minister, has recently taken up a stance that has certainly made him no friends in the mainstream party. He proposes introducing a new deal to the economy, where the government will have an iron grip over matters, so as to both create projects for jobs, and to ensure we never fall into this economic mire ever again."
NZL_end_state_paternalism:0 "End State Paternalism"
NZL_end_state_paternalism_desc:0 "The government shall no longer have a say in forcing action's upon its sovereigns. The only thing that has resulted as an attempt of such archaic policies is anger on half of the citizens, and incompetency on our part. We shall leave destiny in our citizen's hands."
NZL_conservitive_outreach:0 "Conservative Outreach"
NZL_conservitive_outreach_desc:0 "Our success is becoming apparent over the united and national party, to the point we are siphoning voters and even MP's from them. And even with those too stubborn to jump ship, we can approach them and reach deals with them, for our similarities are more than our differences. We shall unite the right."
NZL_begg_plan:0 "Implement the Begg Plan"
NZL_begg_plan_desc:0 "Begg has introduced a radical, and similarly controversial, plan to the Legion, one where we shall pay off our vast debt caused by the great war, black monday, and ensuing split from Australasia, back to Ottawa in one fell swoop. We do this not by monetary means, but by taking in their unemployed workers, bringing them to our isle, and giving them the jobs they so desperately need."
NZL_oppisition_to_tooley_street:0 "Fight against Tooley Street Bankers"
NZL_oppisition_to_tooley_street_desc:0 "Our attempts to march into better days have continually been impeded by a conglomerate of whining British Exiles, those who have taken residence and headquartered in Tooley Street. These bankers put their own monetary hold over our nation's attempts to safeguard New Zealand prosperity."
NZL_implement_radical_democracy:0 "Implement Radical Democracy"
NZL_implement_radical_democracy_desc:0 "The grubby hands of Labour and the Tories have gerrymandered our fair nation past the point of redemption, taking power from the hands of equal constituents and putting them towards their own use. We must move toward democracy in it's basest form, where the majority decide who shall be Prime Minister of this country.

### legion 2

NZL_legion_two:0 "The Legion Marches Further"
NZL_legion_two_desc:0 "Our vast reforms that we implemented last election cycle have proven immensely popular, and thus carried our populist wave into yet another term in office here in Wellington. And thankfully after getting our organization's teething problems out of the way, we should hopefully move as a more unified bloc this time around."
NZL_convert_patlitable_form:0 "Move to the center"
NZL_convert_patlitable_form_desc:0 "We have for far too long been a fairly gray organization, hard to describe as we have had differing identities all over, depending on which sect you came across. Now with our populist wave riding on the popularity of a truly democratic movement for the middle class, we shall fill the vacuum the desolate coalition has consistently failed to, that of a right wing New Zealand they can call home."
NZL_absorb_conservitive_intrests:0 "Absorb Conservative Interests"
NZL_absorb_conservitive_intrests_desc:0 "Our efforts to make good with conservative voices across the table has not been unsuccessful, as our rightist populism has attracted many a soul from the coalition to become all but officially, one with the legion. We now make a play to absorb Reform into our legion, with Sidney Holland being keen on such a vast unity that our two power blocs would bring to the table."
NZL_legion_is_yours:0 "Fight Against Bankers and Dole Bludgers"
NZL_legion_is_yours_desc:0 "The radicals of our legion have gained enough popularity to seize the chair of our organization, and thus the leadership as a whole. They have already begun a blitz to fulfill an agenda that would see those who have wronged our legion and New Zealand as a whole called out and targeted until they no longer can leech on our fair land and people. "
NZL_cambel_inspiration:0 "Inspiration from Campbell"
NZL_cambel_inspiration_desc:0 "Despite what Labour agitators would try to describe as a despicable force, the New Guard of Campbell back in Australia had the right mindset to bring a nation out of the gutter. The Legion here must take notes if they seek to bring pride and purpose back to this nation. "
NZL_democracy_with_a_strong_helmsmen:0 "Democracy with a Strong Helmsman"
NZL_democracy_with_a_strong_helmsmen_desc:0 "While democracy shall remain a part of New Zealander life, we must put our faith in a strong executive to guide our vessel through storm currents wherever they may come. What is the point of a parliament leading us when their own petty squabbles can gridlock our governance for months at a time? Only the strong may lead us."
NZL_conservitivism_without_weakness:0 "Conservatism Without Weakness"
NZL_conservitivism_without_weakness_desc:0 "We have managed to safeguard our middle class, and even create a prosperity amongst our citizenry that hasn't been seen since before the depression hit. And yet despite all that, we stayed firm and dedicated to keeping our way of life intact, without drastic changes or sacrifices from the standard New Zealander way of life. We do not seek to stray from the path that has been walked before, as we know it's reliable."
NZL_reduce_goverment_beuraccy:0 "Reduce Government Bureaucracy"
NZL_reduce_goverment_beuraccy_desc:0 "War, Cancer, Paperwork. The world and humanity would all be better off without such occurrences and problems, and while the former two may be unavoidable, we can certainly curb the latter. Needless government eyes and hands in every way of life shall be cut down to the necessities only, as we do not require a vast office complex to question the way of our citizen's lives."
NZL_remove_problamatic_members:0 "Remove Problematic members"
NZL_remove_problamatic_members_desc:0 "Our achieved unity between all those who love democracy yet wish to see a prosperous New Zealand has been a project that we had to sweat for. Yet it was almost all for naught with the radicals whose rhetoric almost scared away the merger with Reform. We must take a firm hand and push away those who spread division here."
NZL_strong_hand_aganist_syndicalism:0 "A Strong Hand against Syndicalism"
NZL_strong_hand_aganist_syndicalism_desc:0 "Fair maiden England, Workhorse America, even our own union with Australia. All sullied and undermined by those red parasites who agitate and carve out discord amongst a populace to hate each other. In order to protect what little we have left on these islands of ours, we must strangle all socialist sentiment in the cradle."

###united 1
NZL_united_reform_victory:0 "1st Coalition Victory"
NZL_united_reform_victory_desc:0 "After Billy Hughes signed the Consolidation of Resources Act, and democracy in our confederation was suspended, the Reform and United parties worked together as the Kiwi's interests in the Australasian experiment. Although that failed, the coalition remained intact to prevent Labour from benefitting from a conservative split, which leads us to today, where our coalition has won, but remains on unsteady ground due to the two differing parties."
NZL_toe_the_canadian_line:0 "Toe the Canadian Line"
NZL_toe_the_canadian_line_desc:0 "We continue to remain inspired by Canadian ideals, not only for they represent the long dead Commonwealth dream in the Entente, but also because politically we are in a quite similar situation to them. We must tread carefully and entertain the spirits of Reform, for if our coalition splits now, the red menace will take advantage of it."
NZL_balance_the_budget:0 "Balance the Budget"
NZL_balance_the_budget_desc:0 "Besides Labour terms, the way a PM and his cabinet were to propose a budget and toe according to that has remained a status quo, an established orthodoxy in our country's economics. Let's return to that, by keeping to the plan and not raising taxes anymore than needed, to keep the citizen's satisfaction up."
NZL_relif_work_for_unemployed:0 "Relief Work For Unemployed"
NZL_relif_work_for_unemployed_desc:0 "Our nation's labor pool has been in dire straits since Black Monday hit, and we desperately need to get them back to work if they can have any hope of coming home with wages again. We must find any work we can pay them to get about doing in order to help mitigate this unemployment crisis."
NZL_anti_tammyism:0 "Anti-Tammanyism"
NZL_anti_tammyism_desc:0 "Ever since our nation has restored it's individual independence, we have been plagued by blood sucking political elites, who control small little fiefdoms in counties and municipalities, and create unconquerable machines by appointing allies to seats. Let us combat this with a simple first step, by removing their ability to appoint 'servants' to seats."
NZL_remove_housing_controls:0 "Remove Housing Controls"
NZL_remove_housing_controls_desc:0 "The inability for companies and entrepreneurs to build housing that shall shelter our population is the very reason that we have downtrodden men sleeping in boxes on the street. Let us put power in the hands of those who can make a difference on the ground."
NZL_end_upper_house:0 "End Upper House Red Tape"
NZL_end_upper_house_desc:0 "Modeled after the House of Lords of deceased England, the Legislative Council is a long gone glory of it being intended as a check and balance in our democracy, serving as red tape in finalizing bills and wasting taxpayer money. The National Party will appoint new members to this council. Their purpose? To abolish the council from within."
NZL_absorb_country_party:0 "Absorb the Country Party"
NZL_absorb_country_party_desc:0 "Long lost brothers in arms, the Country party was formed when a farmer's union, which felt that we had lost touch with our rural roots, packed up and ran with their electors. Now with them finally calming down as that controlling union has been dying out, we can bring them back into our fold in good grace."

To equip women with the necessary skills and knowledge, training programs will be established. These programs will focus on various subjects such as engineering, machinery operation, welding, and assembly line production. Technical schools and vocational training centers will provide these courses. Moreover, alongside the training initiatives, propaganda campaigns will also be launched to highlight the significance of the work these brave women are undertaking. By involving women in these crucial roles, New Zealand seeks to strengthen its industrial capabilities and ensure its preparedness in the face of potential war.

United under a monarch, or 'Te Kīngi', that is elected into the dynastic house of Wherowhero by the leaders of the constituent tribes of this union, the Māori King Movement and their king now control the fate of the nation. In this new age, the Kīngitanga has taken up the modern Pan-Māori torch, seeking to unite the various iwi of our archipelago under one unified state and syncretic culture. In pursuit of this dream, Te Kīngi Korokī Mahuta Te Wherowhero shall carry the burden of leadership and bring our enlightened form of elective and enlightened monarchism to all Māori in Aotearoa."

Under direction of Te Kīngi, the various Māori tribes across Aotearoa shall be brought into the fold, using diplomacy when possible and force when necessary to bring the various iwi across both the North and South Islands, uplifting and granting autonomy to the White population while influencing them with our ideas along the way, in order to solidify our dominance over the state.

Though its usage and adherence has fluctuated over the years since its creation, it has always remained important to New Zealand, and we are here today to affirm its existence and message in totality. Though we shall work towards the Pan-Māori dream and the uplifting of the Māori people, we shall not leave our fellow New Zealanders behind, regardless of their race or background.

Composed of elected members serving terms lasting three years, with two representatives being elected from each marae - or administrative region organized around a central holy place shared by iwi local to a particular region utilized as districts in the parliament - the Kauhanganui Parliament shall now be empowered to become the dominant legislative body in Aotearoa, creating a strong and just governmental body loyal to our cause and sensitive to the plight of our people.

We must foster closer relations between the Māori and Pākehā of New Zealand, showing each other our different cultures and worldviews while proving that the Kīngitanga government can and will take care of their needs and wants despite our Pan-Māori goals and focus.

This democratic heritage must be enshrined, and a new constitution shall be drafted that solidifies our government as one of the People, by the People, and for the People of Aotearoa, for all mankind is created equal, and these truths shall be held as self evident, engraved into the foundations of our modern monarchy."

With these reparations being paid back to the people most in need of it, our people shall be given the justice they need and deserve, righting a wrong of the past while securing a road to a brighter and more unified tomorrow."

### Events

nzl.1.t:0 "The Divorce From Australasia"
nzl.1.d:0 "New Zealand has distanced itself from Australasia's collapse, forging its own path. With the support of Canadian loyalists, there remains a chance of a truly democratic and locally governed nation. While Australia succumbs to radicalism, we remain resilient. We have endured years of disillusionment with Australasia's failed national experiment, suffering from unequal development and poor governance. Under the leadership of the esteemed General Bernard Freyberg, loyalists to the King in Ottawa, both men and women, have taken up arms to restore peace to our island. They have also prepared for Australia's response. Farmers' union-organized special constables, known as "Cossacks," strive to help the army restore order on the streets. The local military units have forcefully disbanded Labour Party branch meetings, which had ties to discontent on the mainland. This resulted in the arrests of Michael Savage, Bob Semple, and Walter Nash. However, peace remains elusive as the New Zealand Federation of Labor emerges, comprising the country's strongest trade unions. In an unexpected appointment, Fintan Walsh leads the Federation. They receive support from both syndicalists and reformists, and the country echoes the cries for strikes in workplaces nationwide. Though the fringe communist faction calls for the junta's overthrow, their limited numbers hinder their success. Amidst the chaos across New Zealand, the North Island suffers the greatest impact. Taking advantage of the turmoil, farmers seize Maori land en masse to compensate for their losses in the collapsing economy. In response, disenchanted Maori gather around the Kingitanaga movement, centered in the mountainous "King Country" on the island's western side. They organize their own defense, known as Maree, to protect against these land seizures. The nation now teeters on the edge, facing the critical challenge of confronting radicals from within and on the mainland. The preservation of our republic hangs in the balance, requiring our resolute resistance to these threats."

nzl.2.d:0 "After hours of loud arguments and brawls, the New Zealand Federation of Labour has declared a national strike. The arrest of the Labour leadership was a bridge too far for the Freyberg government. Now both syndicalists and mainline unionists have joined together. Fintan Walsh, despite his own reservations about going militant, especially with the outbreak of war with Australia, has effectively organized his unionists to hold fast against any attempts to break their picket lines. This has already stopped the war industry as workers leave the assembly line to strike. Further, an IWW leader named Tom Barker, has smuggled himself back from America and assumed control of the syndicalist factions. Despite this, the Council of Trade Unions has stayed neutral, not crossing any picket lines established by the NZLF. However, they are still working independently of the NZLF, and continue their own initiatives. It is unsure how long the strike will last as machines grind to a halt inside factories. The government has announced that it will not negotiate with the strikers and is determined to break the strike. The country braces for a tumultuous week ahead."

This union town has been fighting inch by inch against police presence. The New Zealand Artillery have likewise secured Buckle Street, placing soldiers with fixed bayonets and machine guns at each end of the street. The locals and strikers have been outraged by the military presence in the area and have protested to demand their removal. The police and military have refused to leave, however, leading to deepening tensions between the two sides. One thousand special constables were also stationed at Mount Cook, receiving catering and supplies from the army. They have also been trained in cavalry maneuvers to disperse strikers should the strike blow. All these preparations have been made, yet the strikers refuse to budge. There is a precarious situation, as the homefront lacks troops to spare for the strike to hold off Australian invasions. The strike is stuck with both sides in a deadlock, neither willing to back down. It is unclear how long this will last, but the government is determined to see the strike through by any means necessary."

With undercover agents, they have identified union leaders and their subordinates. Union members have also been monitored to ensure no risk of an armed uprising or mass flight from their current hideouts. The police commissioner has suggested meeting to create clear demands to end the strike to then suggest to the government to act upon. However, during this meeting, the police will establish a perimeter around the location and several plainclothes officers. This will enable them to cut the head off the Syndicalist snake and destroy the organization of these striking workers."

The loss of their mainstream leaders has only led to radicals taking control - mostly communists. With the support of the major feminist councils set up by Elise Farley, even more riots have broken out. Believed to have lost all power with Lenin's fall from grace and the rise of syndicalism, communism may return. The nation's people are now unsure of what the future holds - will communism take over or will the current system prevail?

The nation's future remains uncertain as Freyberg's loss of faith reaches an all-time high. Several divisions have revolted, and citizens have taken to the streets to protest against the government's oppressive tactics. The situation is volatile and could lead to further unrest and violence. However, following several short skirmishes and a large march led by workers, mutineers, and civilians in the capital, the Freyberg government resigned. In its place, communists have seized control, and New Zealand has fallen victim to the red tide. The new government has focused on restoring people's rights and bringing an end to violence.

Due to the unions' harsh demands, it is possible that these sentiments have been leaked. First of all, the union has demanded the pardon of the Labour party leadership. They also requested the opportunity to run in elections after independence for New Zealand is secured. In addition, the strikers demand a complete apology for declaring them traitors. Further pardoning of strikes and unions have also been sought, which was expected. However, this demand also includes IWW syndicalists. Ultimately, most worrying are the demands to bring back the arbitration system, implement collective bargaining agreements, and further labour reforms. These reforms have been described as a return to the status of New Zealand's labour agreements before Australasia. However, there are clear fears that this would push the power of unions too far and allow syndicalist taint to seep into a newborn nation. In the end it was decided that..."

Under the direction of the major unions, a concerted effort was made to end this chaos. It's finally dawned on these autocrats in the Freyburg government that they have squandered their chance and have begun evacuating to Canada. Workers rejoiced, knowing the oppressive military government was gone. The long struggle had been won, and the nation could finally look forward to an era of stability with the unions leading the charge. With the dismantling of the remnants of Freyburg's government, it's been decided that to ensure that the power the workers have today is maintained by replicating a similar system to the English revolution. However, it is critical that this system is created without their excesses, loyal to our love of democracy and freedom."

With the economy in shambles, workers had no choice but to accept the agreement. It was the only way to ensure their livelihoods for their loved ones. Not even the released Labour party leadership spent much time relaxing. Instead, they immediately started working with the government organizing ongoing efforts, driving further military recruitment and helping create a complete national effort to ensure our national independence. It seems now with this revised agreement the focus has returned to the war and the effectiveness of our efforts has increased more quickly than expected."

As the police have been enlisted in the war effort, they offer no resistance to land seizures. However, as more land is taken from Maori tribes, chaos ensues. Cossack brigades, redirected from the cities, support the freeholders in their assault on the Maori, aiming to halt their resistance. Consequently, peace on the North Island has been disrupted. In response to these circumstances, the Maori King Movement has opened its borders to offer refuge to those who have lost their land. Their power in the king's country remains intact, separate from the freeholder influence. Nonetheless, there are rumors circulating that the Maori are accumulating large quantities of arms without accountability. This has raised concerns that they may challenge our government. In light of these developments, some have suggested intervening in this matter in order to prevent further deterioration, lest we see an open uprising."

Tragically, this has resulted in the loss of Cossacks, who play a crucial role in maintaining peace, on the streets. The escalating violence has led to severe unrest between Maori and settlers, causing tensions to reach dangerous levels. Consequently, our government has been urged to take action against these subversive elements by force, prompting the declaration of a state of emergency. In response, Freyberg announced an expedition comprising of his most capable men. The mission is to venture into King Country and quell the Kingites, ultimately restoring peace and stability. The situation remains highly volatile and unpredictable as the Maori continue launching ambushes and conducting hit-and-run attacks on troop convoys and rural settlements in the countryside. The expedition's challenge remains significant and dangerous."

The recent expedition sent to confront the Maori has encountered a ruthless guerrilla war, with fierce fighting unfolding across every inch of King Country. Nonetheless, with the larger force of New Zealand led by Bernard Freyberg, many see a Pakeha victory as inevitable. Upon reaching Rangiriri, the site of the pivotal battle in the previous war, the expedition faced no immediate resistance and decided to establish a camp. However, reconnaissance teams soon noticed earthworks further down the river. Surprisingly, these earthworks flew the white flag, signaling a call for peace between the Maori and the expedition. Viewing this as an opportunity to swiftly conclude the battle and return to the frontlines against Australia, Freyberg chose to meet with the Maori. Accompanied by a sizable detachment and with the camp on high alert, the marshal approached the Maori lines, seemingly in an atmosphere of peace. However, smoke suddenly billowed from the camp behind Freyberg. In a tactic reminiscent of the English book, it appeared that the Maori had employed a similar strategy used in the previous battle. This was done by staging a fake surrender to lead Freyburg to a poorly defended position. In addition, they set the camp ablaze behind him. With their plan in full effect to end the war, the battle's outcome was..."

Those who failed to pick up arms failed against Maori guerrillas, with both police and cossack forces collapsing. If this momentum continues, the Kingites may be able to achieve a full coup soon. The government must act quickly to stop the Kingitanga from taking over, or else the country may face a new era of Maori rule. It is important to remember that the Maori guerrillas are still very much a threat and must be dealt with firmly and swiftly.

Their decision to withdraw from defending New Zealand presented significant challenges to the national army. As a consequence, the parliament has been seized, and another government, led by Maori King Koroki, has been declared by the Kingite forces. Their objective is to establish a truly sovereign nation, asserting Maori self-governance and independence. The situation remains fluid, with uncertainty surrounding the country's future and power balance. The Kingitanga have been joined by other Maori groups, as well as some European settlers, as loyalists to the original government evacuate. It appears New Zealand iis now again under Maori rule."

This is New Zealand's darkest hour as large groups of Pakeha, European settlers that lived among the Maori, have begun stockpiling arms.

nzl.86.d:0 "With the announcement of upcoming elections, the pressing question of how political parties of old will be managed occupies many minds. Striving for reconciliation and Maori sovereignty recognition, the delicate task of balancing the interests of the majority Pakeha and the first nation peoples has been challenging. Nevertheless, a decision has been reached. \n\n Labour and the Ratana parties have joined forces, combining working-class interests with Ratana Church activism. This merger is now led by Eruera Tirikatene, the first Ratana member ever elected. Her consistent advocacy for social welfare aligns with the Labour party's principles. \n\n In 1918, the Ratana Church was founded by T. W. Ratana. He, after receiving divine visions, was called upon to preach God's word and provide spiritual and physical healing for his people. The party was formed to advocate for the ratification of the Treaty of Waitangi. It pushed for Maori representation and equal Maori voices across the nation. Although it existed during the Australasian era, its chances of significant political power were previously limited to four seats. Despite this, with the rise of the Kingitanga movement, the party now sees a real chance to wield influence on a broader scale. \n\n On the other hand, the Nationals have emerged from the merging of remnants from the Reform and United parties, united under Apirana Ngata. He served as a mentor on Maori rights for many party members. An esteemed figure, Ngata is recognized as an icon of the Maori struggle, even before Ratana was formed. \n\n However, Ngata's reputation has been marred by controversy, stemming from his previous disgrace as Minister of Native Affairs. Accusations of overspending on Maori social projects and literacy efforts during an economic crisis led to his resignation. Furthermore, his department was plagued by misappropriation of funds, particularly benefiting the tribe he was part of. Despite these issues, many still view him as a hero. There is hope that he can rise above adversity, akin to Lazarus, and reclaim a prominent position in the political arena once more."

These actions have further deepened support for the king in his Iwi lands. In addition, with the use of newly acquired state media, it has further popularized him among the population as a whole. The king has used his platform to speak out against the injustices of the colonization of the homeland by Europeans, and to advocate for Maori rights.

Te Kooti was among the last major leaders in the 19th century Maori wars. After being interned on false charges after collaborating with the British, Te Kooti was exiled on the Chatham Islands. During his captivity, Te Kooti faced immense hardship and injustice. However, he escaped in 1868 and formed a group of loyal followers known as the Ringatu faith. With his newfound spiritual beliefs, Te Kooti embarked on a journey of resistance and seeking justice for his people. Te Kooti led a guerrilla campaign against British forces, evading capture numerous times. He became renowned for his strategic prowess and ability to rally Maori tribes to join his cause. Te Kooti's actions and leadership during this time became a symbol of Maori resistance to colonization and oppression. Eventually, in 1883, Te Kooti was granted amnesty by the New Zealand government, acknowledging his influential position and desire for peace. After his release, he continued to promote Maori rights and worked towards reconciliation between Maori and European settlers. Te Kooti's life testifies to his unwavering determination, spiritual strength, and commitment to his people's well-being. His legacy as a leader, warrior, and advocate for justice has left an indelible mark on the history and culture of the Maori people in New Zealand."

After weeks of negotiations, the federation has reached an agreement with the communists to allocate positions for their members within the union. The most significant role has been bestowed upon their leader, Alexander Galbraith, through a promotion within the union, ensuring his loyalty. The objective behind this decision is to end the insidious infiltration and manipulation of union infrastructure by the Communist Party. Such interference has caused internal divisions and hindered party unity. Unlike the English government, which is heavily influenced by unions, our government is shaped by locally elected members who are overseen by the unions.

Simply taking from England's far off radical revolt would spell doom for our nation especially with our vastly different form of union organization. Instead of just copying Mother England, a New English form of syndicalism must be created, built on our liberal economy and democracy.

Three years later today, the divorce became official as Elise took full responsibility for their child Donald Farrelly.

The wedding was held in a small ceremony in Christchurch with close friends and family. The couple is reportedly very happy and looking forward to the future. While both come from different factions of the party, Jack being a hardliner supporting Victor Wilcox while Elise a moderate, it seems both have agreed to keep party politics out of their marriage so it doesn't end up like her last.

Incorporating traditional New Zealand characteristics, such as those of the old socialists that made up the early Labour movement, as well as modern labourite and Maori work. These proposed policies will fit our nation's material conditions. In collaboration with the Maori people for both the liberation of workers and the nation, a renewed effort for Maori sovereignty has begun. Such an effort is spearheaded by dialogue with leaders like Te Puea, Ratana and others. New Zealand writers have also adapted early de-Leonist inspiration into feminist and pro-union works. Finally, increased democracy and local participation using transparent and free elections will allow for more freedom in our ongoing experiment. This is done while never compromising on communist party rule."

A man by the name of Stanley Graham embarked on a shooting spree, killing and wounding several, including police officers. The events leading up to the massacre can be traced back to Graham's strained relationships with his neighbors and local authorities. Graham had been involved in a series of disputes over land and property, which escalated over time. Feeling aggrieved and isolated, he harbored deep resentment towards those who wronged him. Graham's anger boiled over. A rifle was pointed at Anker Madsen as he rode his bike by Graham. He then shot at five Volunteer Defence Corps officers who had arrived at the scene in response to the initial incident. As news of the situation spread, additional police officers were dispatched to Kōwhai Flat. The nation's largest manhunt was underway. Graham was confronted only a few weeks later and shot dead in a firefight between him and the Volunteer Defence Corps. Graham claimed 14 lives during the search. While it is unknown what exactly caused Graham's disturbed nature, police reports show he had a history of threats and violence. In the aftermath of these shootings, the Graham household was burned down. The government has now relocated his wife and children across the country.

This happened shortly after crossing Six Mile Creek, between Hyde and the Rock and Pillar Range. Therefore, the train derailed. The locomotive stopped on the side of the Cutting, approximately 60 meters from the derailment point. The impact caused the boiler to burst, extinguishing the fire in the firebox and causing severe scalding to the fireman. The carriages were mangled around the locomotive; all seven passenger carriages veered off the tracks. The second carriage overturned and ended up in front of the locomotive, while four other carriages telescoped into one another. Due to the remote location, rescuers took 90 minutes to reach the scene. Initial reports from Middlemarch mentioned a possible accident with a few injuries, and medical personnel did not rush to the disaster site. However, upon catching sight of the devastation from a rise on the road half a mile away, they swiftly proceeded to the scene. Some passengers remained trapped in the wreckage for several hours.

These obstacles caused significant delays in the construction process. As a symbolic representation of New Zealand's struggles in recent years, hindering progress, the successful completion of this railway line brings hope for the upcoming era of advancement. Prior to its full completion, the railway was partially operational, running commuter trains three times a week and facilitating major freight movements.

nzl.121.d:0 "At the turn of the century, New Zealand was perceived as a testing ground for social democracy. This was evident through the widespread presence of unions and the use of arbitration. While class conflict persisted, it was alleviated, aiming to eradicate inequalities among the population. However, this idyllic vision was shattered due to the Weltkrieg and the nation's absorption into Australasia. Those who once embraced this vision underwent radicalization, resulting in two distinct paths. Some aligned with the mainstream union movement and found inspiration in the revolutions in England and France. On the other hand, the hardline socialists, constituting the left wing of various parties that would eventually form the Labour Party, admired the failed Leninist revolution in Russia. These radicals embraced Bolshevik writings but also immersed themselves in American SPA and French Jacobin literature. From these study groups, the Communist Party of New Zealand was born. It established a centralized party infrastructure, consisting of a small yet active group of students. In addition to establishing a newspaper, the party's primary objective was to disseminate communist ideology regardless of its nation of origin. Additionally, the party sought to infiltrate key positions within New Zealand's unions. However, the crackdowns on subversive activities that followed the English and French revolutions escalated with New Zealand's incorporation into Australasia. As a result, many members were arrested across the country, forcing the party to go underground. This led to the party becoming the New Zealand wing of the Communist Party of Australasia. Despite its small size, around 100 members, the party's influence over unions continued to grow. In this context, Alexander Galbraith assumed the position of New Zealand's executive and general secretary of the party. This was despite lacking charisma and having a previous prison record. He devoted himself wholeheartedly to party growth. Now separated from the Australian communists, and with reduced influence from the unions, the party rose to power, although it was built on shaky foundations. As the nation stands in this delicate state, the question looms whether they can uphold an agenda that would make Lenin proud. The future of New Zealand's communist movement is uncertain. However, its leaders are determined to pursue their vision and shape the nation's political landscape."

It is rumored that this tactic is meant to entice Canadians to interfere with our democracy. However, so far, this strategy has not yielded significant results. As we engage in conversations with Canadians, initial hostility seems to have diminished. This suggests that this attack may simply reflect a lingering attachment to past practices and approaches. Ultimately, as the government focuses on implementing beneficial policies and addressing the nation's challenges, it is essential to maintain a forward-looking perspective and prioritize the well-being of the people.

Embracing certain aspects of Labour's platform, the Nationals acknowledge the significance of the superannuation system in providing for our aging population. They advocated for doubling its rate.

However, this budget has faced severe criticism from both the National Party and Fintan Walsh. They argue that it denies the working class access to basic luxuries like tobacco, alcohol, and cars. In these challenging times, the government is navigating a delicate balancing act, striving to safeguard the nation's well-being while maintaining fiscal responsibility.

nzl.151.t:0 "Kiwi Theoretician of the Australian Right"
nzl.151.d:0 "Begg and numerous legionaries have attracted a noteworthy new addition to our movement, Arthur Nelson Field. Field, a highly controversial figure, previously served as an MP for the reform party before becoming involved in journalism and writing while fighting in the Weltkrieg. Since his return, he has garnered support from the New Zealand Far Right, promoting anti-Semitic literature, criticizing Maori obstructionism, and denouncing syndicalist interference. This support comes primarily from Empire loyalists and the Australian Centre Party. One of Field's notable works, "The Truth about the Slump," which delves into our nation's economic collapse during the Australasian period, has gained significant traction and recognition, with even Canadian SocCreds referencing it. It is this very book that led the social creditors within our movement to invite him to join the legion. He is now hailed as an icon of their faction. While his ideas have faced criticism, particularly from those he has previously antagonized, his economic theories offer considerable value to our government."
nzl.151.a:0 "Certainly an interesting figure."

nzl.157.t:0 "Colleges are a Supposed Breeding Ground for Syndicalism?"
nzl.157.d:0 "Arthur Nelson Field, a prominent writer associated with the far-right movement in the country and connected to the radical wing of the Legion, has recently published his latest book. Following the success of his previous works, "The Truth About The Slump" (1934) and "The Truth About New Zealand" (1939), Nelson has now shifted his focus to the education system in New Zealand. The book argues that school boards employ evolutionary theory to indoctrinate the younger generation to foment revolution. Nelson calls for intervention to cease the teaching of this theory to protect our nation from aesthetic-satanic motivations. Throughout the book, the author vehemently contests the authenticity of evolutionary theory. He launches attacks against its creators and discredits the evidence supporting it as fraudulent. While these arguments may not be entirely novel, as they echo common talking points found in similar books that the author often references, the conclusions he draws present a fresh perspective. He traces the theory's origins back to French revolutionary thought, positing that its sole purpose was to replace religion. Expanding upon this notion, the author further claims that the French Revolution was merely a contrived spectacle orchestrated by the same hidden forces responsible for the communist and syndicalist uprisings of the modern age. Nelson says anyone promoting evolutionary theory aids and abetts these covert forces. \n\n Many critics of this book find it laughably flawed. Many point to the author's blending of opinion with fact, selective ignorance of inconvenient evidence, flawed assumptions, misinterpretation of quotes taken out of context, and non sequitur arguments. These are clear indications that the book was not written in good faith to present a valid argument against evolution. Instead, they argue that it was crafted with a clear agenda to link New Zealand's far-right figures to a conspiracy. Furthermore, critics are concerned about the author's well-known anti-Semitic views. They argue that the constant references to "hidden forces" and "puppet masters" provide no significant leap in logic to suggest that the book's claim of "hidden forces behind the French Revolution and other revolutions" is merely a covert insinuation of a Jewish conspiracy."
nzl.157.a:0 "Certainly another book of all time."
nzl.158.t:0 "The Supposed "Truth" of New Zealand?"
nzl.158.d:0 "Today, the far-right author and social credit theorist Arthur Nelson Field has released a new book, in which he claims to expose how "New Zealand came to jump from the frying-pan of capitalism into the fire of socialism." Building on the success of his previous book, "The Truth of the Slump," which aimed to reveal the orchestrators of debt, syndicalist wreckers, and bureaucrats working in unison to undermine New Zealand's economy during its integration into Australasia, his latest work, "The Truth of New Zealand," seeks to uncover the present forces impeding the newly independent economy. Unsurprisingly, the author asserts that the same causes are behind these challenges. The book's main critique revolves around the system that emerged after a coup, which heavily relies on speculative investment and socialist intervention. Field says this system serves a select few elites at the expense of most Entente loyalists. Although popular within the social credit movement, many economists criticized the book for oversimplifying complex issues. They have also attempted to attribute all of the country's hardships to a single elite group. The author employs a populist appeal, presenting his system as the only solution, while pretending to provide a fair and balanced explanation of the facts. Furthermore, Field's well-documented belief in a Jewish conspiracy to subjugate the capitalist and Christian world, originating from syndicalist movements in England and France, as well as its alleged connection to the collapse of the British presence in Australia, has led many to view this as the root cause of the problems highlighted in the book."

nzl.500.t:0 "The Bob Semple Tank"
nzl.500.t:0 "With the ongoing economic collapse in New Zealand, our military can only prioritize infantry doctrines, and we lack indigenous armor design. This is a serious security risk as we would have to rely on foreign imports for this critical defense resource, which isn't possible in the economy's current state. In addition, the increasing focus on tanks across the globe causes severe concern, with many critiquing the focus of an infantry-dominated military. One man seems to have come to our rescue, Bob Semple!\n\n A hero of the Labour movement and the Labour party, this titan of New Zealand is proposing a set of tanks to defend ourselves. Having limited capacity to produce tanks, the man has taken advantage of the industry we have on hand and developed a design to meet the needs. As we can produce and use a lot of Caterpillar D8 tractors, the design would utilize its chassis and build a tankette with corrugated and non-corrugated manganese. This armor deflects small arms fire and outputs enough firepower to target enemy infantry with its six Bren light machine guns. Only costing roughly £5,900, and with no formal plans for its usage in any offensive role, it has been proposed only as a last line of desperate defense. While many across the nation have ridiculed the idea, especially those opposed to Labour, some have acknowledged the worth of such preparations. It is only being discarded as only to be used in an extreme eventuality due to impracticality, but it has been acknowledged as an impressive effort for an inexperienced civilian."

nzl.509.t:0 "The Second Australasian Experiment?"
nzl.509.d:0 "When we made the momentous decision to liberate Australia from its internal challenges, many doubted our ability to achieve our objectives. Regardless of the claims made by these skeptics, reality now lies directly before us, leaving us with a choice of actions. After careful deliberation, a federal system will be established. This will be done with New Zealand constituting one state and Wellington serving as its capital. In this endeavor, our democratic principles and policies will be shared with Australia, alongside our political parties. This entails the assimilation of New Zealand's Labour party into Australia's Labour party, while our conservative party aligns with their corresponding counterpart. By assuming the role of patriarch in this union, New Zealand is hoped to ensure a balanced relationship between the two nations. Moreover, this integration aims to address the development disparities that characterized the previous Australasian experiment. As we move forward, let us embrace this opportunity to forge a closer union with Australia. This will extend the reach of our democratic ideals and fostering mutual progress and prosperity. Together, we can work towards a brighter future for both nations."

nzl.350.t:0 "The Transformation of the Marae Network"
nzl.350.d:0 "Marae generally consist of an area of cleared land roughly rectangular in shape, bordered by stones or wooden posts and sometimes terraces called paepae that are used in certain ceremonies. In the center is usually a large ahu stone that serves as the central object of focus in the square, and in contemporary Māori life these marae serve a vital daily significance. With rituals, local meetings, public forums, religious services, and more being held in these stone plazas, they have become fundamentally important not only to our people, but to the government itself. The new administrative divisions created by the state to be used by the Kauhanganui Parliament for elective purposes are each centered on specific marae, with the names now even being shared between these plazas and the administrative districts of our new Aotearoa. By the will of Te Kīngi and the Kīngitanga government, a new breed of monarchist bureaucracy and modern administrative organization structure has been created in our archipelago off the back of a preexisting and wholly unique apparatus used by our people alone; one that fuses functionality, spirituality, cultural impact, community input, and pragmatic practicality all into one useful package for the Crown to use to our advantage."

nzl.353.d:0 "After the First World War, Māori people migrated from the country to the cities seeking work and a better life. Many have faced discrimination from landlords and had little option than to settle in the so-called slum districts of cities, where landlords were more open to Māori as tenants, but where the houses were often old and run-down. With the ascendance of the Kingitanga such squalor conditions will not be tolerated. Support will be given through social housing along with returning the land stripped from Maori hands by the landlords back to the tenants. This will be an important step towards achieving equality and justice for Māori. The government must act to ensure that Māori are given the same rights and access to housing as other citizens. All New Zealanders should be able to live in safe and secure homes."

nzl.354.d:0 "Te Reo, has been in mass decline for years. This was due to a number of factors, including the influx of European settlers and the cultural assimilation of Maori people. Additionally, the Maori language has been discouraged in its use, which has negatively affected its continued use. These issues have been further highlighted at universities, in prominent social circles, and in a recent petition to our government from New Zealanders with over 30,000 signatures. The nation faces calls for an increased effort to promote the Maori language and ensure Maori cultural identity remains alive for generations to come. In response to this call, classes have been opened across primary and secondary schools. Te Reo has been recognised by law as the official language of New Zealand. Signs in public have been altered to include place names in Te Reo, along with the English version. The government has also set up initiatives to ensure the language is passed down to the next generation by providing language classes for children and adults."
