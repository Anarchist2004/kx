### Bios ###

POLITICS_HUYNH_PHU_SO_DESC:0 "Huynh Phu So, called Xen as a child or as he is known more commonly now as Duc Thay - the Virtuous Master - or as Duc Huynh Giao Chu - the Virtuous Sect Founder and Patriarch Huynh - or more simply the Living Saint or Living Buddha of Vietnam, may look like a mere young man at first glance, but this young man stands as the most dominant and beloved figure in all of Vietnam. Born in the village of Hoa Hao along the Mekong in 1920 during the hellish transition period between the French and German colonial regimes, Huynh’s life was met with hellfire from the moment of his birth. Born into a moderately wealthy peasant family, he was plagued with illness as a boy, but his bravery convinced his father to send him to the Seven Mountains to learn how to be a man from the famous hermit mystic Doan Minh Huyen. Upon finishing his training some years later, So had apparently gained the ability to heal the sick and cure the insane, curing even himself before going on to become a wandering teacher of his own form of Buddhist thought. Over the years, this unique form of Buddhism would evolve into Hoahaoism, and his proselytization of these inflammatory works only enraged the German colonials, prompting his arrest on more than one occasion, even being imprisoned in a psych ward for a time after the Germans tried to convince the colony he was insane. However, with each arrest, the Living Saint only grew more and more in popularity, fueling his eventual rise atop the back of his fanatically loyal volunteer army of nationalist zealots and diehard loyalists originally called the Followers of Xen. Now as the syncretic and mystic leader of this new Vietnam, the Virtuous Master Huynh now guides Vietnam the best he can as more and more of the apparatus of state falls under the control of the nationalist army of his own creation. Though he shall always be the face of Hoahaoism, how much say the Living Buddha truly has is not fully known."

VIN_Administrative_Reform:0 "Reform the Administration"
VIN_Administrative_Reform_desc:0 "For better or worse, the current crisis has only proved the ineffectiveness of our government. In order to win the support of the people, we must undergo the arduous task of reform.

VIN_Cabinet_Reorganization_desc:0 "We have finally triumphed over the Vietcong insurgents and are ready to lead the nation towards its destiny. The victorious Bao Dai has moved to dissolve the Imperial Council and will make a formal proclamation regarding the reorganization of His Majesty's cabinet. Both the Vietnamese people and Ostasien officials are anxious to hear the outcome of the Emperor's decision."
VIN_Economic_Efforts:0 "Mobilize the Economy"
VIN_Economic_Efforts_desc:0 "The uprising has already taken a heavy toll on our economy, and we have been forced to gamble with our own survival. To help alleviate this issue, the Imperial Council has been tasked with finding a way to fill our coffers with much needed funds."
VIN_Education_Reform:0 "The Role of the Examination System"
VIN_Education_Reform_desc:0 "For nearly a millennia, the great dynasties of Vietnam have relied on Confucian civil service exams to select those worthy of serving the nation. As we turn a new page on the future of Dai Nam, we must finally decide on the status of these exams. Traditionalists within the council cite these exams as an important symbol of our history while Westernizers see it as nothing more than another example of our antiquated past."
VIN_Imperial_Council:0 "Convene the Imperial Council"
VIN_Imperial_Council_desc:0 "To combat the Vietcong insurgency, Emperor Bao Dai has formalized the creation of a national council to guide the nation through this time of crisis.

VIN_Military_Mobilization:0 "Raise a National Army"
VIN_Military_Mobilization_desc:0 "While the fires of revolution burn ever brighter in Indochina, we cannot expect to rely on our severely outmanned militia forces to help maintain order.

VIN_Our_Social_Agenda:0 "Extend an Olive Branch"
VIN_Our_Social_Agenda_desc:0 "While many within the VNQDD have taken up arms against our government, several workers and peasants within our nation still believe in their ideals of Democratic Socialism.

VIN_Pacification_Effort:0 "Increase Pacification Efforts"
VIN_Pacification_Effort_desc:0 "While we have control over the major cities of Hanoi and Hue in part thanks to German assistance, the rural countryside is dominated by Vietcong forces.

Each faction of the Imperial Council is sure to have their own solution to this problem."
VIN_Purge_Sympathizer:0 "Purge Sympathetic Socialists"
VIN_Purge_Sympathizer_desc:0 "The traitorous VNQDD have chosen the side of the Indochinese enemy, and many of their cells still operate within our borders. We must swiftly deal with this fifth column before we are utterly destroyed from the inside!"
VIN_Secure_Foreign_Assistance:0 "Secure Ostasien Aid"
VIN_Secure_Foreign_Assistance_desc:0 "Much to the displeasure of nationalists within our council, we cannot undervalue the contributions that the German government has made towards supporting our struggle.

### Cao Dai ###

VIN_Absorb_Vietcong_Program:0 "Integrate the Insurgents"
VIN_Absorb_Vietcong_Program_desc:0 "It is hypocritical to preach peace and unity while we actively hunt down the remaining Vietcong cells still operating in the countryside. Enough blood has been spilled and the time has come to bring the nation together under the Divine Eye. Amnesty will be offered to Vietcong who lay down their weapons and significant welfare reform will be put in place by our government."
VIN_CaoDai_Republic:0 "The Beatific Republic"
VIN_CaoDai_Republic_desc:0 "The false Emperor Bao Dai’s proclivity to suckle at the teet of the German imperialist has proven without a shadow of a doubt that Vietnam has evolved past its need for a monarch. Thus, the leaders of the Caodaist faith have agreed to follow a republican agenda, cooperating to create a theological and spiritual republic that combines all the beliefs and needs of the people of Vietnam. No longer shall our golden shore yield to foreign needs, for if our religious revolution is to succeed, we must first consolidate our hold here in the homeland and ensure that all are taken care of and on board for our future syncretic plans."
VIN_Consolidate_Rural_Bases:0 "Consolidate Rural Parishes"
VIN_Consolidate_Rural_Bases_desc:0 "During the Indochinese revolt, Caodaist parishes in the rural countryside were able to effectively hold out against the Vietcong. With the war finally at an end, we can send much needed support to these loyal holdouts and finally bring order to the lawless countryside."
VIN_Convergence_of_Five_Religions:0 "Convergence of the Five Religions"
VIN_Convergence_of_Five_Religions_desc:0 "Caodaists believe that their religion provides a perfect synthesis of the Five Great Teachings of the past: Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, the various ancestor and folk religions of old humanity, and the Abrahamic Faiths of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. These five broad religions shall form the foundation of our one united humanity under the Caodaist doctrine, and the tenets of these Five Religions shall form the structure of our new society and civilization. We will prepare for the Convergence, no matter the cost!"
VIN_Cuong_De_Restoration:0 "Cuong De's Restoration"

The coronation of Prince Cuong De will symbolize a new era in our nation's history."
VIN_Elevate_Women_Status:0 "Elevate the Status of Eve’s Daughters"
VIN_Elevate_Women_Status_desc:0 "The Caodaist philosophy is explicit on many aspects of how society should be organized, including the role of women. Women are to be held in equal status to men, with many famous women throughout human history such as Joan of Arc and Mother Mary being held in high regard within the faith. As such, our society must respect women and hold them on an equal footing as men, while delegating them to the societal positions that best suit them. With both genders working in equal tandem, our spiritual revolution can continue without issue."
VIN_Eliminate_Vietcong:0 "Wipe Out the Vietcong"
VIN_Eliminate_Vietcong_desc:0 "While it is true that we preach peace, this must not be mistaken for weakness. If they had their way, the Vietcong would have us killed and our temples looted and burned. We will conduct search and destroy operations in the countryside and wipe out what is left of the Vietcong cells. For the people to know peace, they must also know justice."
VIN_Invite_Prince_Cuong_De:0 "Invite the Rightful Prince"
VIN_Invite_Prince_Cuong_De_desc:0 "It has been revealed to us that Emperor Bao Dai is nothing more than an immoral hedonist who would lead Vietnam to its total destruction. If we are to free the people from materialist vices and bring unity, we must have a sovereign who is both honored and respected. The exiled Nguyen Prince, Cuong De, has close ties with our Cao Dai and would be a more than ideal candidate for the throne."
VIN_Religious_Fervor:0 "Foster Religious Fervor"
VIN_Religious_Fervor_desc:0 "Moving away from the Germans and the corrupt republicans, Bao Dai has begun to lean towards the various religious cults and sects within the Council, such as the syncretic Caodaist and Catholic-Buddhist Coconut Monk movements. With this move, Vietnam and her people drift closer to a theocratic existence under the various syncretic movements of our golden coast."
VIN_Restore_Social_Harmony:0 "Restore Social Harmony"
VIN_Restore_Social_Harmony_desc:0 "Though we have achieved great social unity between the various peoples and sects in Vietnam, there is still much work to be done. We must endeavor to bring the various religions and cultures of Vietnam and wider Southeast Asia together under one syncretic and wholly united banner so that we may guide the earthly masses into the Third Great Amnesty, finally uniting Mankind with God so that true Utopia can be achieved."
VIN_Revive_Nationalist_Rhetoric:0 "Pan-Asian Appeals"
VIN_Revive_Nationalist_Rhetoric_desc:0 "While exiled in Japan, Prince Cuong De held well-established contacts with the flourishing Pan-Asianist movement. With his ascension as Emperor, Cuong De has invited these Pan-Asian ideologues to help guide the new government towards increased cooperation with our Asian brethren. To aid in this transition, a new political party will be formed to enshrine the beliefs of Asian cooperation and anti-imperialism within our society."
VIN_Spread_Caodaism:0 "Under the Divine Eye"
VIN_Spread_Caodaism_desc:0 "Sidestepping the false Emperor, the corrupt republicans, and their imperialist allies, the holy forces of the Caodaists have seized control of Vietnam. Seeking to prepare the nation for the Third Universal Redemption where all religions and faiths on Earth shall come together to unite humanity in its time of need, the Caodaists shall now drive our beautiful nation towards the one true syncretic faith using Vietnamese nationalism and Southeast Asian traditionalism so that all faithful within Vietnam and hopefully the wider religious world shall be set free."
VIN_Strengthen_Church_Order:0 "Honor the Great Faith"
VIN_Strengthen_Church_Order_desc:0 "By utilizing the ‘unique’ hierarchy of the Caodaist faith as a new bureaucracy, we shall create a government structure that meets both the spiritual and societal needs of all under our shared heaven. With our religious father as the pope of our faith and with his endless legions of cardinals, priests, bishops, and monks beneath him, we shall create a nation in which the government and religious hierarchy are completely inseparable and indistinguishable, for that is what shall benefit the faithful masses the most."

As Prime Minister Diem begins to spread his unique ideology form-fit for Vietnam, his Personalist Revolution shall transform our beautiful nation into a paradise on Earth perfectly made for our own people."
VIN_Private_Police:0 "Birth of the LLDB"
VIN_Private_Police_desc:0 "As Diem’s influence continues to increase over the nation, so do his enemies. Not a day goes by where the Prime Minister’s life is threatened by would-be assassination attempts and near death experiences. To solve this issue, a special detachment of the Vietnamese Armed Forces will be created to carry out the will of Diem and his family. In addition, Diem has granted this special force authorization to act well outside of the boundaries of the law, being able to deal with dissidents and insurgents by any means necessary."
VIN_Referendum_For_Republic:0 "The Republican Referendum"
VIN_Referendum_For_Republic_desc:0 "With his rapid consolidation of power all but complete, Prime Minister Diem has set his sights on the last piece of the puzzle, Bao Dai and the Nguyen dynasty. Both the Prime Minister and the Emperor have been at odds with each other in deciding how to lead the state. To help build legitimacy for Diem and his government, Diem has organized a referendum that will allow the people of Vietnam to bring this decision to the ballot."
VIN_Strategic_Hamlet:0 "The Strategic Hamlet Program"
VIN_Strategic_Hamlet_desc:0 "Although the Indochinese war is officially over, Vietcong cells still continue to operate within the countryside.

Unlike the unlawful method of collectivization that is practiced by the Vietcong, landowners will be fairly compensated for the land that is distributed.

The national army is drilled by Ostasien attachés and German owned corporations continue to operate within our port cities.

They either languish in prisons or hide out in exile, wasting precious talent we could put to our own uses. We shall reach out a forgiving hand to these failed revolutionaries, offering redemption and amnesty, along with a position in the Party and government, in exchange for undergoing extensive rehabilitation and reeducation processes.

By further embracing European culture, the People’s Rule Party under Hoang Dao and Nhat Linh have begun to push their own cultural revolution based on a fusion of traditional Vietnamese aesthetics, in order to grab the attention of the commonly conservative masses, and European ideas of Modernism and the Enlightenment. Supporting new artistic, architectural, musical, cultural, culinary, educational, academic, and other aesthetic endeavors, this new cultural revolution is not to be pushed on the public without choice, but shall be openly embraced by the government, creating a new syncretic and beauteous mixture of Vietnamese and European identities, Enlightenment aesthetics, and Modernist notions that shall support the population and become the foundation of our new leap into the future, hopefully fusing the ‘two incompatible steams’ of Asian and European society into one cohesive whole."

A master criminal and accomplished bandit known for rampaging up and down southern Vietnam before establishing himself firmly as the leading kingpin of the Mekong region, Ba Duong seeks to abandon any and all pretenses of politics and ideology, instead seeking to full embrace his so-called destiny of becoming the most successful, most feared, and most respected crime lord of Southeast Asia and beyond, all while caring for his own along the way."
VIN_Rainforest_Robin_Hood:0 "The Pirate ‘Robin Hood’ of the Rainforests"
VIN_Rainforest_Robin_Hood_desc:0 "Born to poor peasants living at the edge of the great rainforests in Ben Tre and later becoming a river pirate stopping sampans for protection money and bribes on their way to sell their wares and catch at the Cholon docks, Ba Duong has long held a soft spot for Vietnam’s rural peasantry and commoners. Though he has a despicable and reviled reputation for being a bloodthirsty, cunning, and brutally efficient mob boss, pirate captain, and criminal mastermind, he has an equally beloved reputation among Vietnam’s most isolated poor for being the Robin Hood figure to the downtrodden masses. Even stealing from the rich and giving to the poor at times, Ba Duong is warden of the rainforests and protector of Vietnam’s seas, guarding and caring for the peasantry in any way he can as he and his men continue their criminal dealings and bandit rampage through other lands."
VIN_Honor_And_Fatherland:0 "Honor and Fatherland"
VIN_Honor_And_Fatherland_desc:0 "Though the group can agree on little else, the bonding motto of Binh Xuyen is ‘Honor and Fatherland’, and it's become the only thing of note that is similar between the various cliques and groups within the Force. Holding honor, both personal and familial, above all while holding intense patriotic love and nationalist fervor for Vietnam as a while, this doctrine has bred an army of unruly but fanatically deadly and zealously loyal madmen - each a wild veteran ready to do and die for their nation should the need arise. In our off time, the men of Binh Xuyen may be bandits, pirates, thieves, mobsters, murderers, hitmen, and more, but when Honor and Fatherland are on the line, we are the best line of defense Vietnam has ever known, and now, we are all they got."
VIN_Black_Fiefdom:0 "The Black Fiefdom of Southeast Asia"
VIN_Black_Fiefdom_desc:0 "Despite the power struggle within our ranks and despite weathering constant attacks from our foes, Binh Xuyen stands tall and strong as we slowly consolidate what little we want from this land and leave the rest to its own devices, kept in check by the laws of violence and natural selection, and occasionally by our own men. As we hold Honor and Fatherland in our hearts, we defend our bandit kingdom from all those who would try to take our Vietnam from us, for this land is ours to protect and do with as we please. We are the Black Fiefdom of Southeast Asia - a dark mark on the map to be avoided at all costs, for there are no monsters here; just men with nothing to lose and everything to gain. None can stand against us, and none shall, for Vietnam and all her riches are ours."

Now placing the Living Saint, reincarnated Buddha Master of Western Peace, Living Buddha of Vietnam, and Virtuous Master of the Hoa Hao sect Huynh Phu So in the executive seat, he shall serve as the spiritual and political leader of Vietnam, and his grace the Living Buddha Huynh Phu So will bring about a millenarian societal transformation of ‘Peace and Plenty’ as guided by his unique paternalist fusion of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Vietnamese folk faiths. However, though this demi-god that walks among us may be the face of the nation and the government, the volunteer army of ravenous fanatics he has amassed behind him may hold more sway than we know, but perhaps the forces of democracy can keep them at bay."

VIN_Peace_And_Plenty_desc:0 "Rising past the infidels that endlessly bickered like the Cao Dai and the lackeys of Diem and Bao Dai, our militia of nationalist zealots and fervent loyalists to the Hoa Hao movement have seized control of the state, placing the Living Saint, reincarnated Buddha Master of Western Peace, Living Buddha of Vietnam, and Virtuous Master of the Hoa Hao sect Huynh Phu So in the executive seat. Now serving as the spiritual and political leader of Vietnam, the Living Buddha Huynh Phu So will bring about a millenarian societal transformation of ‘Peace and Plenty’ as guided by his unique paternalist fusion of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Vietnamese folk faiths.

VIN_Free_Folk_Roots:0 "Return to Our Free Folk Roots"
VIN_Free_Folk_Roots_desc:0 "One of the core ideas of the Hoa Hao movement is for our society and our people to return to a more traditional and community-orientated way of life, free of classist hierarchies that divide mankind, free from the entrapments and pitfalls of statist society, free of the decadent clergy and nobility, free from the vile plague of urbanism that rots away at humanity’s values and ways of life, and free from politics in general, for the only thing we need is faith. We must embrace these ideas and live as a peasant-orientated communitarian society that values peace and cooperation above all, for this is the only way towards nirvana and utopia."
VIN_Mekong_Messiah:0 "The Millenarian Messiah of the Mekong"
VIN_Mekong_Messiah_desc:0 "As the Living Saint, Huynh Phu So holds many powers, such as being able to heal the sick and cure the insane while divining the future and communing with the heavens. Seen as a messianic figure by his growing mass of followers, he is the perfect figure head for any government, demanding undying loyalty and reverence without even needing to ask for it, let alone need to threaten for it. Behind this godly figure, our government shall rule Vietnam in his image, creating the utopian heaven on Earth he envisions while making good for ourselves along the way."
VIN_No_Monks_No_Masters:0 "No Monks, No Monasteries, No Masters"
VIN_No_Monks_No_Masters_desc:0 "The Living Buddha So has long despised the dominance of the clergy and haughty nobility, for they dare to determine who can and cannot commune with the spirit of Buddha and the ancestor spirits - an act against the heavens themselves. There shall be no more clergy, and no more monasteries to house them, with both being peacefully dissolved with the help of our loyal militias, though should violence be needed it is not out of the option. The funds from these sources shall be distributed among the masses, with the excess used by the government to fund our exploits and ambitions. Home and community worship shall be promoted instead, with the Living Saint holding his own mass group prayer ceremonies all around the nation in public, open to all citizens and believes in the one, true faith. There shall be no monks, no monasteries, and no masters, for all of humanity is equal under the Virtuous Master."
VIN_Parochial_Army:0 "The Saint’s Nationalist Parochial Army"
VIN_Parochial_Army_desc:0 "As our movement has grown in size, so too has the theo-nationalist army that brought us to power. This tangled patchwork of different units, groups, and miniature armies must be ripped apart and sewn back together into one cohesive and organized unit. We shall create the Nationalist Parochial Army of the Living Saint, and this centralized fighting force shall serve as the new backbone of our developing armed forces, acting as both elite police and national guardsmen, while also doubling as a special forces and secret service unit under the command of the madman general and violent fanatic Ba Cut. Wiping away both political enemies and enemies of the state and people, each member is guaranteed to be fanatically loyal to the extreme, with a hand at running the nation and defending our living god, for without him, our claim to rule is nothing."
VIN_Abide_By_Ancestors:0 "Abide by the Ancestors and Animism"
VIN_Abide_By_Ancestors_desc:0 "The folk nature of Hoa Hao theism is based in traditional veneration and worship of the ancestors, and Animism focused on the spiritual significance of plants and animals, specifically on the significance of many natural sources of traditional folk medicines such as wild herbs and certain animal parts. We must revive these ideas and engrain them into the modern culture of Vietnam and her people, living once again in a more traditional way while forcing the masses to once again respect the life that has come before them, creating a pious, serene, and ascetic society that values filial piety, the value of our past traditions and figures, and the importance of the natural world we live in, for we must be the guardians of these things we hold dear."
VIN_Precious_Mountain:0 "Way of the Strange Fragrance from Precious Mountain"
VIN_Precious_Mountain_desc:0 "Hoa Hao’s roots lie in the older Dao Buu Son Ky Huong faith - translating to the Way of the Strange Fragrance from Precious Mountain - that was started in the 1800s by famed mystic Doan Minh Huyen of the That Son mountains, who became famous after using his spiritual healing powers to cure the people of the Mekong from a horrific cholera outbreak in the 1840s, and who claimed to be a living buddha sent from the heavens to save mankind. Huyen took our prophet Huynh Phu So in as a child to teach him the ways of the mystic and the divine, and now Huynh Phu So lives as the reincarnation of the Buddha Master of Western Peace, the title of his old hermit-master, by spreading his teachings. We must help the spread of these venerable ideas and make it the dominant strain of Buddhism in Southeast Asia, for it forms the basis of the millenarian Buddhist ideas our faith holds central and dear, and because it truly is the salvation of mankind. Buu Son Ky Huong!"
VIN_White_Lotus:0 "White Lotus, Sangang Wuchang, and the Dharmachakra"
VIN_White_Lotus_desc:0 "The main theistic foundation of Hoahaoism is a fusion of Vietnamese Dharmic Buddhism drawing from the Dao Buu Son Ky Huong faith as well as from more traditional schools, Confucianist doctrine such as the Sangang Wuchang or Three Fundamental Bonds and Five Constant Virtues, and the syncretic White Lotus Faith that fuses Tibetan and Maitreyan Buddhism with Manichaeism, also called the Religion of Light or Monijiao which itself is a Chinese semi-gnostic dualistic religion that frames the universe as a constant battle between forces of good led by a true God and the forces of evil. These various ideas come together to form the basis of our new faith, morals, culture, and nationalist identity, for the people of Vietnam are the manifestation of this Good force on Earth, and as such, it is our duty to fight the darkness wherever we find it while spreading the proven and singularly true faith to all mankind."
VIN_Final_Cycle:0 "The Final Cycle of the Living Buddha"
VIN_Final_Cycle_desc:0 "The time has come for the final struggle, for we cannot preach world peace and to be the saviors of mankind without acting upon it. We have a holy task appointed to us by the spirits of this natural planet, by the heavens, and by the ancestors alike, and only we can heft this burden of salvation. In order to unite humanity into a peaceful utopia with no hierarchies that is enlightened by the true faith, we must act now and unite mankind. However, by watching the rest of the world and the horrors they commit in the name of false causes, it is clear to us now that seeking a peaceful option is a fool’s errand. Utopia can only be achieved with peace. Peace can only be achieved by unity. Unity can only be achieved through faith and struggle, and faith and struggle can only be resolved through war, so let them come. We have a race to save."

VIN_Submarine_Effort:0 "Eastern Sea Raiders"
VIN_Submarine_Effort_desc:0 "For centuries, our Eastern Sea has been a vital area for international commerce and with it, piracy.

vietnam.0.d:0 "With the Vietcong rising in the south, the flame of insurgency has been spreading in all three regions of Vietnam. This is Vietnam's darkest hour, but our country will be and must be saved with the Emperor's iron will and iron fist, but he cannot do this alone. To help guide the nation through these difficult times, the Emperor has assembled a privy council of German advisors, local politicians, and religious leaders. The head of the Indochinese Constitutionalist Party, Bui Quang Chieu, urges the Emperor towards a moderated stance to gain the trust of the population during a time of crisis. Representing the small yet influential Catholic minority is the ambitious governor Ngo Dinh Diem, who advocates a heavy-handed approach towards dealing with the rebellion. Pham Cong Tac, spiritual leader of the Cao Dai movement, has urged the Emperor to call upon a mass movement towards defeating the Vietcong insurgency. The Ostasien attaché has also made the Emperor well informed about the colonial government's benevolence as well as the fruits of continued cooperation with the Reich. While these varying groups are all united towards preserving the nation, it is the Emperor alone who must decide the uncertain future of the empire."

While Vietcong control is strong, some anti-syndicalist rural communities like Catholics and Cao Dai are still resisting VC influence; it's also possible to allow their villages to form self-defense militia and distribute arms among them."

On the ballot, the main three parties of our new democratic movement that stand as dominant and fully likely to win are the redeemed Vietnamese Nationalist Party, the new Indochinese Constitutionalist Party, and the infantile People’s Rule Party. The Vietnamese Nationalist Party, also widely known as the VNQDD or Viet Quoc, is a party of Social Democracy that advocates for Vietnamese Nationalism, Market Socialist economics, and Paternalistic Conservative social views. The People’s Rule Party espouses specifically Annamese Nationalism along with a dedication to the ideals of the liberal Enlightenment and Western Capitalist and Modernist ideals all framed in a unique Vietnamese setting. Finally, the Indochinese Constitutionalist Party stands as one of the few political movements in Vietnam still dedicated to the united Indochinese ideal, preaching egalitarian and equal Indochinese unity with Humanistic Capitalism and Populist Agrarianism united by the pursuit of a just society supported by civil rights. Interestingly, or worryingly depending on how you take it, the Vietnamese Democratic Socialist Party of the Hoahaoist zealots and the Peace and Love Party of the Coconut cultists have both also tried to get their name in the running, but unless officially allowed on the ballot, they hold no actual chance of victory.
