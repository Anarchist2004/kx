VIN_Education_Reform:0 "The Role of the Examination System"
VIN_Education_Reform_desc:0 "For nearly a millennia, the great dynasties of Vietnam have relied on Confucian civil service exams to select those worthy of serving the nation. As we turn a new page on the future of Dai Nam, we must finally decide on the status of these exams. Traditionalists within the council cite these exams as an important symbol of our history while Westernizers see it as nothing more than another example of our antiquated past."
VIN_Imperial_Council:0 "Convene the Imperial Council"
VIN_Imperial_Council_desc:0 "To combat the Vietcong insurgency, Emperor Bao Dai has formalized the creation of a national council to guide the nation through this time of crisis.

VIN_Our_Social_Agenda:0 "Extend an Olive Branch"
VIN_Our_Social_Agenda_desc:0 "While many within the VNQDD have taken up arms against our government, several workers and peasants within our nation still believe in their ideals of Democratic Socialism.

Amnesty will be offered to Vietcong who lay down their weapons and significant welfare reform will be put in place by our government."
VIN_CaoDai_Republic:0 "The Beatific Republic"
VIN_CaoDai_Republic_desc:0 "The false Emperor Bao Dai’s proclivity to suckle at the teet of the German imperialist has proven without a shadow of a doubt that Vietnam has evolved past its need for a monarch. Thus, the leaders of the Caodaist faith have agreed to follow a republican agenda, cooperating to create a theological and spiritual republic that combines all the beliefs and needs of the people of Vietnam. No longer shall our golden shore yield to foreign needs, for if our religious revolution is to succeed, we must first consolidate our hold here in the homeland and ensure that all are taken care of and on board for our future syncretic plans."
VIN_Consolidate_Rural_Bases:0 "Consolidate Rural Parishes"
VIN_Consolidate_Rural_Bases_desc:0 "During the Indochinese revolt, Caodaist parishes in the rural countryside were able to effectively hold out against the Vietcong.

Women are to be held in equal status to men, with many famous women throughout human history such as Joan of Arc and Mother Mary being held in high regard within the faith. As such, our society must respect women and hold them on an equal footing as men, while delegating them to the societal positions that best suit them.

VIN_Spread_Caodaism:0 "Under the Divine Eye"
VIN_Spread_Caodaism_desc:0 "Sidestepping the false Emperor, the corrupt republicans, and their imperialist allies, the holy forces of the Caodaists have seized control of Vietnam. Seeking to prepare the nation for the Third Universal Redemption where all religions and faiths on Earth shall come together to unite humanity in its time of need, the Caodaists shall now drive our beautiful nation towards the one true syncretic faith using Vietnamese nationalism and Southeast Asian traditionalism so that all faithful within Vietnam and hopefully the wider religious world shall be set free."
VIN_Strengthen_Church_Order:0 "Honor the Great Faith"
VIN_Strengthen_Church_Order_desc:0 "By utilizing the ‘unique’ hierarchy of the Caodaist faith as a new bureaucracy, we shall create a government structure that meets both the spiritual and societal needs of all under our shared heaven. With our religious father as the pope of our faith and with his endless legions of cardinals, priests, bishops, and monks beneath him, we shall create a nation in which the government and religious hierarchy are completely inseparable and indistinguishable, for that is what shall benefit the faithful masses the most."

As Prime Minister Diem begins to spread his unique ideology form-fit for Vietnam, his Personalist Revolution shall transform our beautiful nation into a paradise on Earth perfectly made for our own people."
VIN_Private_Police:0 "Birth of the LLDB"
VIN_Private_Police_desc:0 "As Diem’s influence continues to increase over the nation, so do his enemies. Not a day goes by where the Prime Minister’s life is threatened by would-be assassination attempts and near death experiences.

To help build legitimacy for Diem and his government, Diem has organized a referendum that will allow the people of Vietnam to bring this decision to the ballot."

From the ancient pre-Chinese conquest dynasties of Hong Bang, Thuc, and Trieu to Ly, Tran, Dinh, Ngo, Ho, Le, Mac, Tay Son, and finally Ngyuen dynasties of the post-Han and post-Ming eras, ours is a land long dictated by tyrants and monarchs linked divinely to the heavens, and Emperor Bao Dai of the Ngyuen dynasty seeks to continue this tradition for the betterment of all along our golden coast.

VIN_Authoritarian_Rule_desc:0 "Drawing key inspiration from ideas of German absolutism based off his experiences with his German advisors and their heavily monarchist sympathies with Wilhelm back home, while also following the will of his loyal but ambitious advisor Ngo Dinh Diem due to incessant manipulations, Emperor Bao Dai must now decide if he shall rise as an absolutist monarch like the days of old Dai Viet or if he shall rule with the aid of his mentor Diem as a tempered, semi-constitutional monarch. As a member of the Nguyen dynasty that has ruled Vietnam for nearly a century, Bao Dai is one of the few souls in the nation with the blood authority to be able to make such a move, and now the choice alone lies in his hands."
VIN_Bao_Dai's_Restoration:0 "Bao Dai's Ascension"
VIN_Bao_Dai's_Restoration_desc:0 "Refusing to bend to the religious fanatics, the power-hungry Governor Diem, and the unpredictable constitutionalists, Emperor Bao Dai has heeded the words of his German confidants and has chosen to rule as an absolute monarch.

Under the ‘Land to the Tillers’ program, a cap will be placed on how much land an individual can own and the excess land will then be distributed amongst the peasantry. Unlike the unlawful method of collectivization that is practiced by the Vietcong, landowners will be fairly compensated for the land that is distributed. These royal reforms will help build a sense of trust in our government and put an end to the rural peasantry’s reliance on the Vietcong."
VIN_National_Education_Campaign:0 "National Education Campaign"
VIN_National_Education_Campaign_desc:0 "If we are to bring our nation into the modern era, we must first deal with the mass illiteracy that has plagued our nation. The rigid examination system and decades of colonial rule had ensured that only a small portion of the population was literate.

Literacy schools will be opened across the rural countryside where peasants will be taught in the Quoc Ngu script."

VIN_Emperor_and_his_Subjects:0 "The Emperor and His Subjects"
VIN_Emperor_and_his_Subjects_desc:0 "After much deliberation, the Emperor has appointed Pham Quynh, an already prominent member of the Emperor’s cabinet, as Prime Minister. Quynh is both a Confucian scholar and an adherent of the prominent French philosopher, Charles Maurras.

VIN_Modern_Mandarin:0 "The Mandate of the Mandarins"
VIN_Modern_Mandarin_desc:0 "In the waning years of their oppressive rule, the French colonizers had made attempts to do away with our cherished Confucian examination system. Due to their defeat at the hands of the Germans, these efforts were put to an end and our honorable system has thankfully remained in place. As the only nation in the world that still retains these civil service examinations, Quynh's government has undergone an extensive effort to make sure that the mandarins remain as a shining model for morality in our nation." 
VIN_Quadrilingual_Education:0 "Quadrilingual Education"

These new requirements will assist our noble government in restoring prestige to our once honored examination system."
VIN_Village_Autonomy:0 "Decentralized Rural Councils"
VIN_Village_Autonomy_desc:0 "As a scholar of integralist thinkers such as Charles Maurras, Pham Quynh understands that restoring order to the countryside does not come from government intervention, but rather the opposite. Basing his reforms along ideals of decentralization and localism, Quynh has authorized the creation of regional committees that will be allowed to deal with local issues in ways they see best fit. These councils will enjoy a high degree of autonomy while remaining loyal to the Emperor."

It shall enshrine equal rights, egalitarian representation for all citizens, guaranteed personal and civic freedoms, democratic traditions, judicial fairness, and much more, ensuring that all true citizens of the nation have a just, fair, and free life secured by a state they can trust and have a say in."
VIN_Deal_With_Colonials_desc:0 "Despite the overtures of the Emperor, many ardent nationalists within the provisional government cannot turn a blind eye to Bao Dai’s continued support from the Kaiserreich. The national army is drilled by Ostasien attachés and German owned corporations continue to operate within our port cities. This issue has led to a division within our government, those who believe that German cooperation is a necessity that we could possibly profit from and those who wish for the Emperor to cut off ties with the Kaiserreich immediately. Before we can carry on with our reforms, a decision must be made."
VIN_Democratization:0 "Liberal Democratization of Vietnamese Society"

The head of the Indochinese Constitutionalist Party, Bui Quang Chieu, urges the Emperor towards a moderated stance to gain the trust of the population during a time of crisis. Representing the small yet influential Catholic minority is the ambitious governor Ngo Dinh Diem, who advocates a heavy-handed approach towards dealing with the rebellion. Pham Cong Tac, spiritual medium of the Cao Dai movement, has urged the Emperor to call upon a mass movement towards defeating the Vietcong insurgency. The Ostasien attaché has also made the Emperor well informed about the colonial government's benevolence as well as the fruits of continued cooperation with the Reich.
