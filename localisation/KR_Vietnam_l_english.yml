VIN_Education_Reform:0 "The Role of the Examination System"
VIN_Education_Reform_desc:0 "For nearly a millennia, the great dynasties of Vietnam have relied on Confucian civil service exams to select those worthy of serving the nation. As we turn a new page on the future of Dai Nam, we must finally decide on the status of these exams.

VIN_Imperial_Council:0 "Convene the Imperial Council"
VIN_Imperial_Council_desc:0 "To combat the Vietcong insurgency, Emperor Bao Dai has formalized the creation of a national council to guide the nation through this time of crisis.

VIN_Our_Social_Agenda:0 "Extend an Olive Branch"
VIN_Our_Social_Agenda_desc:0 "While many within the VNQDD have taken up arms against our government, several workers and peasants within our nation still believe in their ideals of Democratic Socialism.

Amnesty will be offered to Vietcong who lay down their weapons and significant welfare reform will be put in place by our government."
VIN_CaoDai_Republic:0 "The Beatific Republic"
VIN_CaoDai_Republic_desc:0 "The false Emperor Bao Dai’s proclivity to suckle at the teet of the German imperialist has proven without a shadow of a doubt that Vietnam has evolved past its need for a monarch. Thus, the leaders of the Caodaist faith have agreed to follow a republican agenda, cooperating to create a theological and spiritual republic that combines all the beliefs and needs of the people of Vietnam. No longer shall our golden shore yield to foreign needs, for if our religious revolution is to succeed, we must first consolidate our hold here in the homeland and ensure that all are taken care of and on board for our future syncretic plans."
VIN_Consolidate_Rural_Bases:0 "Consolidate Rural Parishes"
VIN_Consolidate_Rural_Bases_desc:0 "During the Indochinese revolt, Caodaist parishes in the rural countryside were able to effectively hold out against the Vietcong.

As such, our society must respect women and hold them on an equal footing as men, while delegating them to the societal positions that best suit them.

VIN_Spread_Caodaism:0 "Under the Divine Eye"
VIN_Spread_Caodaism_desc:0 "Sidestepping the false Emperor, the corrupt republicans, and their imperialist allies, the holy forces of the Caodaists have seized control of Vietnam. Seeking to prepare the nation for the Third Universal Redemption where all religions and faiths on Earth shall come together to unite humanity in its time of need, the Caodaists shall now drive our beautiful nation towards the one true syncretic faith using Vietnamese nationalism and Southeast Asian traditionalism so that all faithful within Vietnam and hopefully the wider religious world shall be set free."
VIN_Strengthen_Church_Order:0 "Honor the Great Faith"
VIN_Strengthen_Church_Order_desc:0 "By utilizing the ‘unique’ hierarchy of the Caodaist faith as a new bureaucracy, we shall create a government structure that meets both the spiritual and societal needs of all under our shared heaven. With our religious father as the pope of our faith and with his endless legions of cardinals, priests, bishops, and monks beneath him, we shall create a nation in which the government and religious hierarchy are completely inseparable and indistinguishable, for that is what shall benefit the faithful masses the most."

As Prime Minister Diem begins to spread his unique ideology form-fit for Vietnam, his Personalist Revolution shall transform our beautiful nation into a paradise on Earth perfectly made for our own people."
VIN_Private_Police:0 "Birth of the LLDB"
VIN_Private_Police_desc:0 "As Diem’s influence continues to increase over the nation, so do his enemies. Not a day goes by where the Prime Minister’s life is threatened by would-be assassination attempts and near death experiences.

From the ancient pre-Chinese conquest dynasties of Hong Bang, Thuc, and Trieu to Ly, Tran, Dinh, Ngo, Ho, Le, Mac, Tay Son, and finally Ngyuen dynasties of the post-Han and post-Ming eras, ours is a land long dictated by tyrants and monarchs linked divinely to the heavens, and Emperor Bao Dai of the Ngyuen dynasty seeks to continue this tradition for the betterment of all along our golden coast.

As a member of the Nguyen dynasty that has ruled Vietnam for nearly a century, Bao Dai is one of the few souls in the nation with the blood authority to be able to make such a move, and now the choice alone lies in his hands."
VIN_Bao_Dai's_Restoration:0 "Bao Dai's Ascension"
VIN_Bao_Dai's_Restoration_desc:0 "Refusing to bend to the religious fanatics, the power-hungry Governor Diem, and the unpredictable constitutionalists, Emperor Bao Dai has heeded the words of his German confidants and has chosen to rule as an absolute monarch.

Under the ‘Land to the Tillers’ program, a cap will be placed on how much land an individual can own and the excess land will then be distributed amongst the peasantry. Unlike the unlawful method of collectivization that is practiced by the Vietcong, landowners will be fairly compensated for the land that is distributed.

VIN_National_Education_Campaign:0 "National Education Campaign"
VIN_National_Education_Campaign_desc:0 "If we are to bring our nation into the modern era, we must first deal with the mass illiteracy that has plagued our nation. The rigid examination system and decades of colonial rule had ensured that only a small portion of the population was literate.

VIN_Emperor_and_his_Subjects:0 "The Emperor and His Subjects"
VIN_Emperor_and_his_Subjects_desc:0 "After much deliberation, the Emperor has appointed Pham Quynh, an already prominent member of the Emperor’s cabinet, as Prime Minister.

VIN_Modern_Mandarin:0 "The Mandate of the Mandarins"
VIN_Modern_Mandarin_desc:0 "In the waning years of their oppressive rule, the French colonizers had made attempts to do away with our cherished Confucian examination system. Due to their defeat at the hands of the Germans, these efforts were put to an end and our honorable system has thankfully remained in place. As the only nation in the world that still retains these civil service examinations, Quynh's government has undergone an extensive effort to make sure that the mandarins remain as a shining model for morality in our nation." 
VIN_Quadrilingual_Education:0 "Quadrilingual Education"

VIN_Village_Autonomy:0 "Decentralized Rural Councils"
VIN_Village_Autonomy_desc:0 "As a scholar of integralist thinkers such as Charles Maurras, Pham Quynh understands that restoring order to the countryside does not come from government intervention, but rather the opposite.

These councils will enjoy a high degree of autonomy while remaining loyal to the Emperor."

VIN_Deal_With_Colonials_desc:0 "Despite the overtures of the Emperor, many ardent nationalists within the provisional government cannot turn a blind eye to Bao Dai’s continued support from the Kaiserreich. The national army is drilled by Ostasien attachés and German owned corporations continue to operate within our port cities. This issue has led to a division within our government, those who believe that German cooperation is a necessity that we could possibly profit from and those who wish for the Emperor to cut off ties with the Kaiserreich immediately. Before we can carry on with our reforms, a decision must be made."

They either languish in prisons or hide out in exile, wasting precious talent we could put to our own uses. We shall reach out a forgiving hand to these failed revolutionaries, offering redemption and amnesty, along with a position in the Party and government, in exchange for undergoing extensive rehabilitation and reeducation processes.

Led by bandit turned revolutionary General Le Van Vien and master criminal General Duong Van Duong, the Binh Xuyen force may be diverse, divided, and barely cohesive, is temporarily united around one goal and is hellbent on cleansing Vietnam of its liberal sins once and for all. Coming together as a disorganized but effective and terrifying maelstrom of violence and villainy, this raucous horde now tries to steer Vietnam in one direction or the other, with the cracks of in-fighting and internal power struggles already beginning to show."

Known for his background as a police officer under the colonial regimes before he joined the Force and for his interest in politicking, diplomacy, and scheming, Bay Vien has further gain infamy for making deals and temporarily collaborating with the Chinese, the Japanese, the Germans, the French, the failed Indochinese revolutionaries, and many more, including various religious orders and the factions of Bao Dai and his ‘Miracle Man’ Diem that fell in order to fuel our rise, all in the name of gaining power for himself and his allies while honing his skills as an officer and master of subterfuge. Along the way however, he has picked numerous different and immensely varied philosophical and political ideas over the years, fueling his dive into theory and away from the mindless banditry of his comrades as he attempts to fuse them into one coherent ideology that benefits himself over all others.

A master criminal and accomplished bandit known for rampaging up and down southern Vietnam before establishing himself firmly as the leading kingpin of the Mekong region, Ba Duong seeks to abandon any and all pretenses of politics and ideology, instead seeking to full embrace his so-called destiny of becoming the most successful, most feared, and most respected crime lord of Southeast Asia and beyond, all while caring for his own along the way."

Though he has a despicable and reviled reputation for being a bloodthirsty, cunning, and brutally efficient mob boss, pirate captain, and criminal mastermind, he has an equally beloved reputation among Vietnam’s most isolated poor for being the Robin Hood figure to the downtrodden masses.

As we hold Honor and Fatherland in our hearts, we defend our bandit kingdom from all those who would try to take our Vietnam from us, for this land is ours to protect and do with as we please.

VIN_Vietnamese_Airbornes_desc:0 "Much of Indochina is covered in dense foliage and wetlands which makes the logistics of moving an army an immensely difficult task. To remedy this, members of our high command have suggested the creation of an elite paratrooper division similar to the Fallschirmjäger used in the German Empire. These elite forces could reach areas otherwise inaccessible to a normal division and can deploy at a moment’s notice. Nhay Du Co Bang!"

VIN_Armor_Experiment:0 "Tame the Steel Monsters"
VIN_Armor_Experiment_desc:0 "The Indochinese Revolt marked the first time in history that tanks rolled through the Vietnamese lowlands. Unknown to the peasantry, these machines struck fear into the hearts of the guerillas, often causing Vietcong insurgents to retreat back into the jungles when they came into contact with them. We will take advantage of our close relationship with the Ostasien government and ask that our army be provided with these ‘beasts’ of our own."
VIN_Army_Reorganization:0 "Reorganize the Army"
VIN_Army_Reorganization_desc:0 "Hastily assembled during the Indochinese Revolt, our ‘armed forces’ are nothing more than a ragtag group of local militias, police forces, and palace guards. To make matters worse, corruption among our commanders is rampant and many of their loyalties lie with religious sects or criminal organizations rather than with our government. If we are to stand a chance against a modern army, we must undergo a massive reorganization campaign to regulate our armed forces and stamp out widespread corruption."
VIN_Centralized_Command:0 "Centralize Militia Command"
VIN_Centralized_Command_desc:0 "In order to create an effective fighting force organized enough and drilled enough to always be relied upon to defend our newly-freed state, we must centralize the mess that is our army structure. To this end, we shall reorganize the armed forces from the ground up, creating a structured and professional military centralized around our single united army command."

VIN_Da_Lat_Academy_desc:0 "In order to help train a new generation of soldiers and officers with the skills needed to bring our armed forces into the future, we will work with the Ostasien government and their Germanic expert to set up a military academy here in Da Lat.

VIN_Enforce_Military_Discipline:0 "By Bullhorn and Crop"
VIN_Enforce_Military_Discipline_desc:0 "Instead of focusing on a select few special forces divisions, we will direct our attention towards building a disciplined national army.

VIN_Firepower_and_Manuever:0 "Firepower and Maneuver"
VIN_Firepower_and_Manuever_desc:0 "The stormtroopers owed their success to the effective use of artillery barrages that would shell enemy positions before allowing infantry to rush in and overwhelm the battered defenders. We will conduct wargames to perfect our infiltration tactics as well as import German artillery pieces to add dignity to what would otherwise be a vulgar brawl."
VIN_Form_Elite_Units:0 "Form Elite Special Forces"
VIN_Form_Elite_Units_desc:0 "Citing the effectiveness of the German special forces during the Indochinese Revolt, our high command has suggested that we prioritize creating these specialized divisions of our own.

VIN_Import_Small_Arms:0 "Import Ostasien Arms"
VIN_Import_Small_Arms_desc:0 "As we set forth on our difficult task of modernizing our army, one of the most significant issues we currently face is a severe lack of equipment. Our soldiers are provided with Great War era rifles and are outfitted with the rags they came in with. To remedy this issue, we will request an additional shipment of rifles, uniforms, and radios from the Ostasien government to help reinforce our woefully under equipped army."
VIN_Military_Modernization:0 "A Self-Sufficient Army"
VIN_Military_Modernization_desc:0 "While the shipments from Singapur have helped us deal with our immediate lack of equipment, we cannot rely on foreign aid forever. To aid in our modernization campaign and help build a domestic industrial base, we will construct armament factories here in Vietnam to help supply our armies without the need of foreign assistance. Not having to rely on the next shipment of weapons can help us study new modern methods of warfare."
VIN_Motorization:0 "Ride the Lightning of La Sat"
VIN_Motorization_desc:0 "Like the Vietnamese folk god of lightning La Sat and his twin Thien Loi, folk god of the sky, our armed forces must strike out fast, quick, and unpredictably as we develop new fast attack tactics and strategies built around the new technology of mass motorization. Instead of relying on traditional horse and ox drawn carts, we will import motorized trucks to maintain our supply lines and traverse the lowlands with ease, allowing us to harness the speed of our deities and create our own form of lightning war form-fit for the rough terrain and realities of Vietnam."
VIN_Reduce_Corruption:0 "Root Out Corruption"
VIN_Reduce_Corruption_desc:0 "With the army whipped into shape from a disorganized rabble to a respected and modern army, we turn our focus to the pervasive corruption that plagues our army at all levels of its foundation.

VIN_Regularize_Local_Forces_desc:0 "Our armed forces are heavily dependent on local militias belonging to religious sects like the Cao Dai and the Hoa Hao, to political parties like the VNQDD, or to local villages and nobles. As a part of our centralization efforts, we will incorporate these ungovernable irregulars into the national army as part of the new Popular Self-Defence Corps. Together, they shall put aside their differences and personal biases while on the field, coming together to protect Vietnam and her domestic possessions while the main armed forces can take the fight to any future enemy without worry that the homeland is undefended and vulnerable."
VIN_Vietnamese_Marines:0 "Vietnamese Marines"

This new age of mechanized warfare would enhance the capabilities of our armies to new heights."
VIN_Vietnamese_Stormtroopers:0 "Vietnamese Stormtroopers"
VIN_Vietnamese_Stormtroopers_desc:0 "During the Great War, the German army successfully utilized the swift and brutal tactics of their stormtroopers to infiltrate enemy lines.

These vehicles will help improve our agricultural yields tremendously."
VIN_Agricultural_Recovery:0 "Aid Our Farmers"
VIN_Agricultural_Recovery_desc:0 "Vietnam has always been a largely agrarian society, with rural farmers accounting for more than half of our nation’s population.

VIN_Coastal_Development:0 "Develop the Mekong Delta"
VIN_Coastal_Development_desc:0 "Located in the southernmost part of Vietnam, the Mekong Delta was the cradle of insurgent activity.

VIN_Develop_Central_Highland:0 "Unite the Central Highlands"

VIN_Economy_Reconstruction:0 "Reconstruct the Economy"
VIN_Economy_Reconstruction_desc:0 "One of the heaviest tolls incurred by the Indochinese Revolt was the massive burden it placed on our economy. We nearly bankrupted our nation by taking out German loans and we asked the peasantry to give up everything to preserve our great Vietnam. Our government now must deal with the daunting task of resuscitating our failing economy and rebuilding from the devastation caused by the war."
VIN_Electronic_Technology:0 "The Voice of Vietnam"
VIN_Electronic_Technology_desc:0 "Radios have only been used by the military and lack a domestic use such as those in Europe or the United States.

VIN_National_Highway:0 "The Trans-Vietnam Highway"
VIN_National_Highway_desc:0 "The nation that is simply known to the rest of the world as ‘Vietnam’ is actually made up of vastly unique cultures split between the distinct North, South, and Central regions. These differences have existed for centuries, dating back to the ancient dynasties that once ruled over Vietnam. To encourage a spirit of unity between our three diverse regions and foster economic growth, our government has begun the construction of a national highway that will span from Hanoi to Saigon."

VIN_Railway_Rebuilding:0 "Rebuild the Railways"

VIN_Research_Institute:0 "Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology"
VIN_Research_Institute_desc:0 "Nearly a century of colonial rule has severely limited our educational and research capabilities, leaving us lagging behind with the rest of the world.

VIN_Rice_Exportation:0 "Rice Export Economy"
VIN_Rice_Exportation_desc:0 "While we bring reform to Vietnam, the one thing that remains consistent is the vital role that agriculture plays in our national economy.

The head of the Indochinese Constitutionalist Party, Bui Quang Chieu, urges the Emperor towards a moderated stance to gain the trust of the population during a time of crisis. Representing the small yet influential Catholic minority is the ambitious governor Ngo Dinh Diem, who advocates a heavy-handed approach towards dealing with the rebellion. Pham Cong Tac, spiritual medium of the Cao Dai movement, has urged the Emperor to call upon a mass movement towards defeating the Vietcong insurgency. The Ostasien attaché has also made the Emperor well informed about the colonial government's benevolence as well as the fruits of continued cooperation with the Reich.
