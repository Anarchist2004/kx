This is Vietnam's darkest hour, but our country will be and must be saved with the emperor's iron will and iron fist, but he cannot do this alone. To help guide the nation through these difficult times, the emperor has assembled a privy council of German advisors, local politicians, and religious leaders. The head of the Indochinese Constitutionalist Party, Bui Quang Chieu, urges the emperor towards a moderated stance to gain the trust of the population during a time of crisis. Representing the small yet influential Catholic minority is the ambitious governor Ngo Dinh Diem, who advocates a heavy-handed approach towards dealing with the rebellion. Pham Cong Tac, spiritual medium of the Cao Dai movement, has urged the emperor to call upon a mass movement towards defeating the Vietcong insurgency.
