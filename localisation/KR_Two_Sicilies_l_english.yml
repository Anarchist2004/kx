SIC_focus: "Two Sicilies Focus Tree"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_FERDINANDO_DESC: "Ferdinand of Bourbon-Two Sicilies' last twenty years have been troubled, as the relative tranquility of exile he lived in since his birth in 1869 was replaced with the responsibilities of being a monarch of a member of the Italian Federation and now a sovereign nation. Having arrived well after the civil war in Italy was concluded, his position was always fragile, and he himself knows he is little more than a puppet in the great game of Sicilian, Italian and global politics at large, as his presence legitimizes the Kingdom internationally and allows it to remain aligned with the powers that be in Europe, having effectively kept large scale syndicalist offensives at bay. His rule, while not without political issues, came after six years of war and strife, and he tries his utmost to ensure that he takes personal credit for this peace and relative prosperity. While he traditionally has kept himself away from political affairs, as he is aware of the fragility of the peace he and many others work to maintain, the matters of the constant syndicalist threat and the lack of a male heir of his body weigh heavily on him. The nascent feelings of powerlessness, even in his current position as a monarch, makes him more prone to overtures by radical monarchists than even he himself realizes."

SIC_theshipyardmatter: "The Shipyard Matter"
SIC_theshipyardmatter_desc: "Sicily has, for more than a decade, greatly profited from the use of its large drydocks to sell warships to various nations in these troubled times. These profits give the state a meaningful contribution, even if most of our drydocks are working for foreign powers. A change of policy may well be in order in these difficult times of austerity."
SIC_seize_existing: "Nationalise Shipyards"
SIC_seize_existing_desc: "By seizing the shipyards for our own use and cancelling ship orders, we can immensely increase our naval production capacity!"
SIC_merchant_marine: "Expand Port Facilities"

SIC_heavy_buildup: "Heavy Buildup"
SIC_heavy_buildup_desc: "We need more ships, capable of beating back the Syndicalist scum and ensure they meet a watery grave deep in Neptune's realm. Not small, puny escort ships, but the great towering barrages of flagships will win us the sea."
SIC_bb: "New Dreadnoughts"

SIC_shbb_desc: "The Kingdom needs a new Flagship; a fully armed and operational dreadnought capable of laying waste to a Syndicalist port in a matter of hours.

SIC_smaller_navy: "Strategic Navy"

SIC_medit_tactics_desc: "Naval Warfare in the Mediterranean is not a simple affair, nor can it be compared to that of the Open Sea. Control of coastlines and ports, and of the skies, will be fundamental, as our capacity to plan naval campaigns and expeditions."
SIC_subs: "Submarine Effort"

SIC_barbones_air_tree3: "IMAM Subsidies"

SIC_organic_kingdom_desc: "The Two Sicilies are one, and yet many. Each castle, each village and each house, product of centuries of incredible history and brave accomplishments.

SIC_ride_the_tiger_desc: "Baron Julius Evola and his radical traditionalists have finally managed to overthrow the meek state of Two Sicilies.

SIC_knights_of_the_grail: "Knights of the Grail"
SIC_knights_of_the_grail_desc: "In order to carry out our goals we will need more than loosely organized militias. The Knights of the Grail, named for adventures whom went on that ancient journey, is a highly-esteemed society made up of our most loyal militants armed with our best equipment so that they may answer directly to the Soveriegn without question and cast his enemies into darkness forever."
SIC_aristocratic_funding: "Aristocratic Funding"

SIC_destroy_liberalism_desc: "At long last we can do away with that system which has made man decadent, weak and pampered.

SIC_integralist_complaceny: "Integralist Complacency"
SIC_integralist_complaceny_desc: "The integralists are on the verge of greatness but they have stopped short by giving into traditional Christian slave morality and desiring a corporatist economy that collaborates with capitalist powers.

SIC_a_proper_king: "A Real King"
SIC_a_proper_king_desc: "It's finally time to finally replace the liberal, foreign Bourbon rule whose very existence was a mockery to our traditions with our traditional nobles.

SIC_anti_clericalism: "Anti-Clericalism"
SIC_anti_clericalism_desc: "For too long the catholic priests have prevented the centralization of power under the monarch in favor of giving spiritual authority to a Papacy that preaches a modernist slave morality. While the transition out of traditional Catholicism will not be easy a good start would be anti-clericalism that cloaks the issue of the Pope's influence in just as nationalist terms than Spiritual ones."
SIC_hit_papacy: "The Vatican is Vulnerable"
SIC_hit_papacy_desc: "Even with socialists to the North and their cause discredited the Papal States continues to play their power games, proving they will always aid themselves to the cost of true leadership.

SIC_platonic_church: "A Platonic Church"
SIC_platonic_church_desc: "The Papal States armies may have fallen but the Church itself still has too much influence to do away with at the moment.

SIC_ghibelline_revival: "Ghibelline Revival"
SIC_ghibelline_revival_desc: "Against the Mercantilist Guelphs the Ghibelline understood that spiritual power should rest with the Emperor alone. Their loss helped usher in the fall of man from rule by the Nobles to Mercantilists so we must revive their legacy. This may turn the tide and as the one closest to the transcendence the King has total authority over religious law with the Papacy being grateful for what they get."
SIC_finish_the_church: "Finish the Papacy"
SIC_finish_the_church_desc: "Just as their can be no compromise with liberal modernism their can be none with the Papacy which espouses a nonsense faith that undermines our leadership and with it our very Spirit.

SIC_patriarchial_traditions_desc: "While the correlation between masculinity and greatness is undeniable many of our foes insist on forms of "female equality" against all hard evidence to the contrary that this is a degeneration of society.

SIC_heroic_idealism: "Heroic Idealism"
SIC_heroic_idealism_desc: "It is through heroic experiences that we not only create men but super-men whom display the best of their nation and find themselves in war, until the act becomes holy itself. Death on the battlefield is nothing to fear for it is the effective overcoming of death itself. We must idealize the hero as the Romans, Spartans and Teutonic Knights did."
SIC_ascetic_values: "Ascetic Values"
SIC_ascetic_values_desc: "Modernism has chained the species to material wants, the lowest of desires.

SIC_sardinias_final_offer_desc: "Sardinia rightfully belongs to the House of Savoy and while Amadeo's stance against the socialists is admirable it is not his place to dispute Emmanuel's claim.

SIC_iron_guard_alliance: "Our Fellow Legion"
SIC_iron_guard_alliance_desc: "There is a Legion of Warriors whom have also come to reject modernity in favor of a national-mysticism that allows men to come into contact with the very soul of their nation.

SIC_magical_societies: "Occult Societies"
SIC_magical_societies_desc: "Despite as predicted it having lower acceptance among the masses our newly established ruling class has come to embrace Evola's religious beliefs far more comfortably than the alternatives offered by Catholicism and atheism.

SIC_constrained_science: "Science Constrained"
SIC_constrained_science_desc: "It is no surprise that the vacuous modernist values sciences study of the material world over spiritual exploration.

SIC_spiritual_casteism: "Spiritual Casteism"
SIC_spiritual_casteism_desc: "At long last the King and our Warrior-Nobility have established total dominance. We must now recognize our internal nations, or castes, so that each individual may live up to their full potential as they were intended to.

May consumerism finally die and Europa live forever!"

### Events ###

sic.1.t: "The Legacy of the Civil War"
sic.1.d: "Following the Napoleonic wars, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was created, combining the two old kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, which lasted until 1860 when Sardinia-Piedmont, aided by Garibaldi's partisans, united Italy under her rule. The South, which was always generally agricultural, suffered at the hands of the Savoyards, who did not care much for industrialising the south, and poverty became commonplace.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg began Italy eventually chose the side of the Entente, much to her ruin. The Austrians signed an armistice in 1919, in which they were allowed to occupy Lombardy and Venetia until a peace treaty was signed. However, outraged nationalists, republicans and socialists rose up against the government for their foolhardy actions in starting a war they were doomed to lose, and when King Victor Emanuel and his son abdicated, the Kingdom of Italy collapsed into anarchy. Civil war soon convulsed the peninsula, and hope seemed lost for the White forces in the south of Italy until the Austrians rejoined the war, in exchange for southern participation in a new political system - the Italian Federation. The Austrians pushed back the syndicalists from Lombardy, and the syndicalist pressure on the Abruzzo line was removed. Following the ceasefire, the south joined the Italian Federation as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, but it was always with the understanding that only the promise of Austrian aid kept the Federation intacy. When the syndicalists threatened the south in 1927, Austria's promises of protection vanished... and while the war never materialized, the worth of the Federation was revealed. The Two Sicilies, the Papal State and Sardinia withdrew, leaving Austria's only place of influence the republic in the north."
sic.1.a: "Now we are on our own!"

sic.200.t: "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies"
sic.200.d: "Since the end of hostilities, the Kingdom has been mostly focused internally. The Christian Democrats, in power since 1921, have been trying to pursue the age-old dream of land reform in the South. The lack of progress on this front, however, caused the Christian Democrat supermajority to fail in 1927, though a democratic coalition has kept power since, and made some small movements toward land reform in Campania and Capua. The rise of the opposing 'Integralisti 'e Doje Sicilie' could signal a radical change in the Kingdom's politics, and only time will tell if they get to achieve their reactionary aims or if democracy will prevail."
sic.200.a: "Long live the kingdom!"

sic.201.t: "The Second Risorgimento"
sic.201.d: "As for the future of Italy, questions have slowly arisen regarding our place in the coming conflict. Peace on the peninsula is held by a delicate balance: if the syndicalists strike, they must do so without drawing the Third Internationale into battle with them. Should they do so, both Germany and Austria will feel compelled to intervene. They will not, however, feel so compelled if Two Sicilies strikes first. So it is on the Socialist Republic of Italy to make the first move towards a Second Risorgimento, and they must do so without French backing. We must keep a careful watch on the Abruzzo line, to see if they become so bold."
sic.201.a: "Viva l'Italia!"

sic.2.t: "Black Monday hits the Kingdom"
sic.2.d: "The economic crisis that began in Germany has spiralled out of control and spread to Italy. The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies' prosperity has been shattered by Black Monday and confidence in the government has been shaken."
sic.2.a: "May God protect us!"

sic.3.t: "Poverty and Crime Rises"
sic.3.d: "With Black Monday hitting our kingdom hard, poverty has skyrocketed and the living standards of many Sicilians have plunged. At the same time, the various criminal cartels and mafiosos have moved in to take advantage of this situation, much to the detriment of the government. Banditry and brigandry have increased in the countryside, and many are demanding that the government do something."
sic.3.a: "Something must be done!"

sic.4.t: "The Camicie Nere"
sic.4.d: "With the rise of crime in the country due to Black Monday, the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale have been formed. The MVSN, or as they are informally called 'Camicie Nere' for their black shirts have been popping up throughout the kingdom, from Naples to Palermo. Supposedly led by Achille Stanation, this paramilitary organisation is described as the muscle behind the Integralisti in the Kingdom, for they have been keeping watch during their rallies, as well as disrupting and breaking up rallies of the left. Joining Stanation is the more controversial Julius Evola whom was only reluctantly allowed into the organization for his far-right monarchist views and the small but fanatical following he brings with him, especially amongst the sons of the upper-class. Nonetheless his past anti-Papal and anti-Bourbon views marks him as divisive even within the Camicie Nere but the black-shirts desire a broad alliance... for now. Their disciplined, militaristic marches through the streets of major cities draw large crowds, and drum up more recruits, especially amongst the youth.\n\nThe Camicie Nere is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and their numbers are still expanding - it's unlikely they'll stay silent during the elections..."
sic.4.a: "We should keep an eye on them."

sic.5.t: "A Call for New Leadership"
sic.5.d: "The Archbishop of Naples, Alessio Ascalesi, has given a stern and powerful sermon claiming that the government's Social Conservative policies are ruining the kingdom and are at fault for Black Monday. He says that it is time for the kingdom to have new leadership with new ideas. Many that support the Social Liberal Democrazia Cristiana have taken this as a sign, and are energised by his rhetoric."
sic.5.a: "May God protect the kingdom"

sic.6.t: "The Liberal Coalition"
sic.6.d: "Since the founding of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, parliamentary power has been contested primarily by the Social Conservatives and the Social Liberals. However, with the rise of the Far Right and the creation of the Integralist Paramilitary force, the Partito Liberale and the Partito Popolare Democratico have agreed to form a coalition. This liberal pact is dedicated to preserving and strengthening liberal values within the Kingdom.\n\nThe creation of this alliance, however, weakens the Social Conservative party, for in the past the Partito Librale tended to support the Partito Democratico Cristiano. For the liberals though there is hope that this new coalition will keep the torch of liberalism strong within the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies."
sic.6.a: "The torch of liberalism shall not fail"
sic.6.b: "The new coalition galvanizes opposition"

sic.7.t: "Fighting between the Left and Right"
sic.7.d: "A rally by the Confederazione Generale Siciliana del Lavoro or the 'Sicilian General Confederation of Labor' for the ruling Partito Democratico Cristiano was disrupted when members of the Camicie Nere disrupted their rally. This disruption quickly turned into a bloody battle that left quite a few injured, and even worse a few fatalities on both sides. While the CGSL has forsworn syndicalism, the Camicie Nere have been lately decrying their members as agents to the Socialist Republic in the North.\n\nNow the outcome of this particular case must be decided. Are these members innocent, or do the words of the Camicie Nere hold merit and truth? Many conservatives are siding with the Camicie Nere, declaring that they are traitors to the Kingdom, while some of the Liberals claim that they are innocent."
sic.7.a: "The Union members are innocent"
sic.7.b: "They are disloyal traitors"

sic.10.t: "The [GetYear] Sicilian Elections"
sic.10.d: "The elections of [GetYear] are now upon us and this year is far more contentious of an election than before. There are currently four parties battling for political domination. Who shall win?"

sic.10.b: "Partito Popolare Democratico"
sic.10.c: "Democrazia Cristiana"
sic.10.e: "Integralisti d'e Ddoje Sicilie"

sic.11.t: "Sicilian Welfare Act of [GetYear]"
sic.11.d: "With Black Monday over, a number of ministers from the Social Democrat Partito Popolare Demoractico have proposed a plan for an extensive welfare system. However, such a move seems to many as not dissimilar to syndicalism. Thus a more moderate form has been proposed as a counter by the Democrazia Cristiana, which has some attraction even among some of the conservatives. However, the remainder of the conservative faction believes we should not implement any sort of socialist or syndicalist reforms in our country, which is clearly what this is."
sic.11.a: "Extensive Welfare"
sic.11.b: "Moderate Welfare"
sic.11.c: "We shall not bring socialism here!"


sic.12.t: "Sicilian Tariff act of [GetYear]"
sic.12.d: "One of the Democrazia Cristiana ministers has proposed that we protect Sicilian businesses through tariffs to make foreign goods more expensive. However, the Liberals counter that the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies is an export-based country, and this could risk a trade war that we cannot afford. A moderate position of some tariffs but not too much has been proposed to find a balance."
sic.12.a: "Full Tariffs to protect Sicilian Business."
sic.12.b: "A Moderate plan."
sic.12.c: "We will not start a trade war!"

sic.19.t: "End to the Camicie Nere"
sic.19.d: "The Kingdom's stability has in recent years weakened the black shirts of the Camicie Nere, but today they finally disbanded. While Integralism is not gone, their paramilitary forces are, and we can breath a sigh of relief."
sic.19.a: "Finally."

sic.20.t: "The [GetYear] Elections"
sic.20.d: "The elections of [getyear] are now upon us. Three main parties are vying for the voter's influence. Whom shall the people choose to be the new Prime Minister?"

sic.20.b: "Partito Popolare Democratico"
sic.20.c: "Democrazia Cristiana"

sic.21.t: "Nobility Act"
sic.21.d: "One of the first acts of the Integralists was to restore various noble titles. While these were never abolished, many had become purely ceremonial, but today marks a full restoration of rights, making these nobles the leaders of their respective regions. Local rulers are the better rulers after all."
sic.21.a: "The Nobility is restored."

sic.22.t: "Trade Union Act of [GetYear]"
sic.22.d: "The issue of Trade Unions must be dealt with and two proposals have been discussed lately. The first would outlaw and criminalise the Unions altogether. The second would force the trade unions into a single union that would be controlled by the government and be strictly non-socialist."
sic.22.a: "Outlaw Unions all together."
sic.22.b: "Force them into a controlled state Union."

sic.23.t: "Catholic Recreation"
sic.23.d: "As part of our new political plan, a program of Catholic-oriented recreation has been created. The program has the local churches sponsoring recreational activities, intertwining support for the Integralist ideology. Such a policy has become rather popular and increases support for our other policies, with the welcome side-benefit of higher church attendance."
sic.23.a: "The beauty of God's work."

sic.24.t: "Protests Against Dissolving Parliament"
sic.24.d: "There have been a number of protests against the government with the permanent dissolution of Parliament, especially from the Partito Democratico Cristiano who are responsible for leading the majority of protests. In order to resolve this issue, three solutions have been proposed.\n\nThe first is to just let them shout and let them tire. The second is to lock them up and silence their voice. The third is to let the black shirts have their way with them."
sic.24.a: "Let them Shout"
sic.24.b: "Lock Them Up"
sic.24.c: "Let the Black Shirts deal with them"

sic.25.t: "Integrate the black-shirts?"
sic.25.d: "With our control of the country secure, the question is how the Black Shirts should be dealt with. Some want to see them integrated into the secret police, while others think that keeping them as a separate organisation will be best."
sic.25.a: "Integrate them"
sic.25.b: "Keep them as our Paramilitary Force"

sic.26.t: "National Catholic Youth League"
sic.26.d: "The National Catholic Youth League has been created to help the youth of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies be taught the ideals of Integralism and Traditional values. The League has two main sub-organisations, one for boys and one for girls. By making sure that the youth are enrolled in the organisation this will make sure that they never sway from the government's ideals."
sic.26.a: "The Youth are the future."

sic.27.t: "Traditional Art Program"
sic.27.d: "With a return to traditionalism across the kingdom, traditional artwork has recently begun to be patronised by nobles. Styles that have not be seen in a century or more are once again being used. Traditional artwork is once again popular throughout the Two Sicilies."
sic.27.a: "Futurism is all bunk anyway."

sic.28.t: "Magna Curia"
sic.28.d: "To govern the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the Magna Curia has been re-founded. The Magna Curia was the principal organisation of the Kingdom of Sicily in the Middle Ages and it brought forth the nobles of the realm. Unlike the parliaments of today, this was a proper noble court and filled with art and learning. The Magna Curia will henceforth be the new governing body and limited only to the ruling local lords."
sic.28.a: "A new Court for an old Kingdom."

sic.29.t: "Ennobled Corporate leaders"
sic.29.d: "With the decision to restore the Nobility to strength, a number of business leaders have either found, bought or forged patents of nobility to bring them within the new ranks of the nobility."

sic.41.t: "De-syndicalisation"

sic.41.b: "We should focus on reconciliation"

sic.42.t: "Strengthening Monarchism"

sic.43.d: "Today, several of the generals that previously fought for the various imposter governments have requested to fight for the Empire. Some feel that they should not fight for us, seeing as they fought against us, but others think that allowing them to fight for our shared country would make for an excellent statement of national unity."

sic.44.t: "Women's role in the empire"
sic.44.d: "In the Socialist Republic of Italy, the traditional roles of women were destroyed. However, now that we are in charge the question of Women's role in the empire has arisen. Some want us to double down on the traditional role for ladies to protect the family, while others think giving them the right to vote, but not run for office, is good enough. Finally, a smaller number, principally from the Social Democratic Partito Popolare Demoractico suggest full suffrage including both the right to vote and the right to run for office."

sic.44.c: "Let them vote and run for office"

sic.45.t: "Dealing with Christian Socialism"
sic.45.d: "In the Socialist Republic of Italy christian socialism was rather popular in the north. As we focus on de-syndicalising society, many politicians want to turn away from liberal philosophies, with many more conservative and far-right members declaring them to be anti-christian. However, some among the Partito Democratico Cristiano think that, by focusing on a moderate christian democracy, we can turn people away from the more radical nature of christian socialism. This policy is criticized for being just a ploy to increase their power in the north."

sic.47.a: "Finally."

sic.48.t: "Churches Reopened"
sic.48.d: "One of the darker policies enacted by the godless Socialist Republic of Italy was the banning of Christianity outright. Their practice of state-enforced atheism involved imprisoning priests and nuns, closing and even destroying churches, and persecuting believers. However now that we have destroyed the vile syndicalists, churches are open once again. Throughout the north, Italians are happy to be able to worship once again, and many are thanking the Emperor for liberating them from the syndicalist tyranny."

sic.61.t: "Act of Succession"
sic.61.d: "One of the concerns for the Kingdom is the succession to the throne of the Two Sicilies. The issue is that King Ferdinand only has daughters and at 67 years old, he is rather unlikely to have any more children. However, the issue is that his two brothers dispute whom should be the heir as the current law states only men can inherit.\n\nNormally according to the laws of the land, the throne would go to Ferdinand's brother Prince Carlos and his descedants, however, Ferdinand's other brother, Prince Ranieri, disputes that claim citing the Act of Cannes of 1900, due to Carlos' marriage to the Spanish princess Mercedes that put him in line for the Spanish throne."

sic.64.t: "Status of Sicily"
sic.64.d: "When the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was re-made after the Weltkrieg, an act by the Parliament in Naples granted the Isle of Sicily considerable autonomy. This act granted the island its own regional parliament. This has granted the island quite a bit of power and influence within the Kingdom's politics."

In practice, this means we would become an autonomous puppet to the [From.GetAdjective] government. It is a tempting offer, though it means abandoning any of our current alliances and wars."

sic.103.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses, For Now"
sic.103.d: "While the [From.GetAdjective] government was not entirely opposed to the idea of trading Piedmont for their sovereignty, they say they are entirely too preoccupied with their current war and intend to see it through. They have asked [Root.GetNameDef] to return with the proposal once more, when peace has been achieved."

He is joined by his longtime Evolian followers whom are dubbed "Radical Traditionalists", anti-clerical nationalists, ultra-right veteran groups and hardline House of Savoy restorationists. The Camicie Nere is clearly irritated that he has left with more members than he entered in with."

sic.1020.d: "The Noble Legion of the Awakening is the umbrella name for a loose grouping of militia societies devoted to the ideas of Julius Evola, receiving funds to protect nobles loyal to their cause from banditry and socialism. The perceived weakness of the King in this trying time has led to more-and-more jobless young men viewing their demands for an immediate revolution (or, as they would call it, counter-revolution) to the Two-Sicilies "rump state" as valid. It's speculated that their growth and ability to provide for members is also the result of funding from aligned royalist exiles in Sardinia, the Republic of Italy and amongst the reactionary members of the House of Savoy whom appreciate the loyalty seemingly pledged to them by Evola."

sic.1030.d: "It is rumored that Evola has expanded his high-secret society, the infamous "UR group" which according to government documents is devoted to discovering "Arcane Knowledge" and is managed by Arthur Reghini. While more practical financial backers of Evola have partially succeeded at confusing the public as to whether its existence is real or merely "syndicalist slander" members of our intelligence services have little doubt it has gained further membership from predominately the sons of aristocratic families both here and in Sardinia, so while the group remains small the connections it provides are quite powerful. More conservative members of our government want to find and arrest members for 'promoting indecency' while the socialists would prefer to focus on the Noble Legion of the Awakening for their part in attacking left-leaning unions. What should we do?"

sic.1040.d: "A wounded World War One veteran whom become a self-taught Italian mystic, Donato Manduzio famously converted to Judaism with a small group of Catholics after the war and bases his community out of San Nicandro. Today however a bomb was mailed to his home which destroyed his residence but thankfully went off while when he was in the backyard. It's generally agreed to be an assasination attempt by "The Sons of Hyperborea", an extreme Evolian group that has affilations with the Noble Legion of the Awakening and are said to be behind a string of terrorist attacks with this being their most dangerous one. While there is no evidence of him being directly involved and denying that he encouraged it Evola nonethless defended the attempt on Manduzio's life as defending the "Aryan Spirit" from someone whom is using his mystical abilites "in aid of the Materialistic Spirit that abetted our descension into Kali Yuga". While some anti-Semites and superstituous elements of society are in agreement with this the attack and Evola's apologism has angered the public and political class unlike the more popular vigilante attacks on syndicalists and criminals that his supporters have conducted. With even some integralists denouncing him we could move on Evola now."

sic.1060.t: "Evola declares March on Naples"
sic.1060.d: "The Noble Legion of the Awakening have declared their intention to March on Naples and oust the unpopular Bourbon King, stating that the governments favoritism for foreign capitalists and socialists over the people of Italy has been made far too clear. Other smaller radical traditionalist groups that collaborate with the Legion to the point of arguably being regional sub-entities such as the Sicilian Warriors of Tradition and the Soldiers of the Aryan Spirit are expected to join them. Sympathetic integralists and nationalists will likewise be joining in."

sic.1090.t: "Legion Broken"
sic.1090.d: "While the fight was bloody the Legion has been fought off and the strong points they occupied during the March in other areas of the nation have been recovered. Evola himself was caught attempting to flee the country by boat and when stopped by officers fired on them with a revolver before being gunned down himself. With the Legion broken the aristocrats whom opposed the Bourbon King have lost much of their threatening presence and influence and he can now do what it takes to save Two Sicilies."
sic.1090.a: "Long Live Ferdinand!"

sic.1100.t: "The Legion takes Power!"
sic.1100.d: "King Ferdinand and his family's flight has broken the spirit and organization of our state as many high level government officials did the same when they heard what happened. To make matters worse the Legion took over ports and other cities while the March was occuring and without any orders to push them back they managed to take these regions with little resistance. Thus at the moment it appears they control our nation."
sic.1100.a: "My God"

sic.1110.t: "Acts of Vigilantism"
sic.1110.d: "The Legion has long supported a hardline stance against criminalism and degeneracy but now that the government has fled they are taking little mercy on the known criminals and hardline Bourbon supporters in the area. While Evola is ecstatic that this wave of violence symbolizes the rebirth of our society's true spirit some of his officers have advised him to pull back Legion forces to organize them into our forces."
sic.1110.a: "No, it's good practice for war"
sic.1110.b: "Yes, we need to pull back our forces for now"

sic.1120.t: "The Question of Wealth"
sic.1120.d: "Our increased diplomatic overtures to Italian Aristocrats in exile have not gone unnoticed and they have been generous in their donations, alongside support from the House of Savoy. While we have already spent some of the money to stabilize the regime by supporting the Legion some wealth remains. The question now is how we should invest these goods?"
sic.1120.a: "Expand the Base Army"
sic.1120.b: "More for the Administration"
sic.1120.c: "Build needed factories"

sic.1130.t: "Parliament Razed"
sic.1130.d: "In a massively symbolic gesture a Legion ceremony was held today in the former parliament in which Evola gave a speech complimenting the Legion for their loyalty and that this was the first step of many from a material world to a spiritual one. The Legion recited a prayer inspired largely by the Mithraic mystery ritual while Evola burned the constitution. They then orderly exited the building and burned it down but not before supposedly drawing symbols inside for good luck. While foreign critics and the government-in-exile have decried this as "madness" it has been a massive blow to the morale of local liberals."
sic.1130.a: "That should send the message"

sic.1140.t: "Knights of the Grail initiates"
sic.1140.d: "Initiated by a blood pact with their Legion commander the Knights of the Grail are now our internal security elite, tasked with special operations missions, investigations and upholding the values of Tradition at all costs. Some are suggesting that we not only allow Legion militants in whom are supported by Legion Commanders but also allow our regional allies to join, while others want our requirements to be stronger in the future and for someone to both a veteran and vouched for by someone of Noble Blood to become a Grail Knight, claiming this will earn us their undying loyalty. What shall we do?"
sic.1140.a: "Keep it as is"
sic.1140.b: "Allow more loyalists in"
sic.1140.c: "Make requirements stricter from now on"

sic.1150.t: "Knights of the Grail Slaughtering Liberals"
sic.1150.d: "The Knights of the Grail are tasked with investigating and capturing prominent liberals whom have gone underground as ordered by Evola and have been told to end their treachery. While initially this was thought to mean arresting them, most of the Knights are taking the opportunity to kill them on sight alongside whomever may be hiding them and confiscating their property. The most frequent of these victims are former labor union leaders and activists. This is not against their rules and indeed according to the Legion command it's an excellent chance for Two Sicilies to experience violent redemption but nonetheless some are saying that Evola should at least require political opponents to be brought in before being tried and executed in a more lawful fashion."
sic.1150.a: "Tis only flesh wounds"
sic.1150.b: "I'd prefer "alive" if possible"

sic.1160.t: "Integralist incorporation"
sic.1160.d: "With the Legion's gambit paying off a majority of the Integralists have viewed us as the best means of restoring Italian Monarchism to its full potential. The faction led by Archille Stanation and Filippo Anfuso have pledged loyalty to Legion values and acknowledged that Parlimentry tactics and attempting to instate National Catholicism under the Bourbon King was a desperate Gambit to save Italy from socialism, but that the path laid out by Evola is now the correct one. However more religiously fervent and morally disgusted members of the Integralist coalition, including Bernardo Attolico, Carmine Senise and Luigi Rizzo have refused to pledge loyalty and simply stated that they would continue to oppose "demonic demagoguery". Together they have chosen to continue the Camicie Nere as a separate organization that continues to ignore our society's Spiritual Revolt. While our militants want to attack them now some more politically-minded supporters, including our newest members, would prefer to wait and give them a chance to see reason."
sic.1160.a: "Purge the remnant Camicie Nere where we can"
sic.1160.b: "We will give them time to change their minds"

sic.1170.t: "Integralist Resistance"
sic.1170.d: "The Camicie Nere has gone from merely being a nuisance to being to the Legion, in the words of Evola, a "lingering modernist tumor". Since our attempts to strike the Catholic Church it has seen a growth as it has billed itself as the "defenders of Catholicism" and even mainstream conservative catholics such as Mario Scelba have reportedly joined them. The King has reassured the people he is merely opposing the presently pseudo-Christian Vatican for weakening the state while Evola has privately done the opposite with the Legion and declared the Holy War against darkness as truly beginning. With the Camicie Nere attacking Legion garrisons, stealing supplies and launching propaganda campaigns against us we must stop them. We could punish their families in an effort to flush them out or simply interrogate priests whom are undoubtedly hiding them. Whom should we focus on?"
sic.1170.a: "The Families"
sic.1170.b: "The Church"

sic.1180.t: "Bombing of Bari"
sic.1180.d: "The Camice have attacked our factories and soldiers today after setting off an explosive in a port in Bari. They must be found at once! Shall we assign more Grail Knights to the investigation or make our war with the remaining Integralists our top priority?"
sic.1180.a: "Put more Knights on the case"
sic.1180.b: "This is now our top priority"

sic.1190.t: "Camicie Nere Found"
sic.1190.d: "After torturing enough captured Camice agents we have at long last discovered the Camice's headquarters in a farmhouse in rural Palermo, with Bernardo Attolico and Mario Scelba themselves being apprehended in the raid. Carmine Senise and Luigi Rizzo were not found however and are said to have fled to Portugal where the Catholic government protects them. Nonetheless from the supplies found it is both clear they were receiving foreign funding and, more importantly, have lost too much to recover as they have been chipped away at for too long to handle a blow of this size. While not all citizens have embraced us this may mark the end of our largest internal political resistance. Now while the Camice Nere soldiers are being publicly executed the question remains of what to do with their leaders, with some advocating a harsher death and others wanting to throw them in a deep hole and see if they break to give up more information."

sic.1200.t: "Battle for Bari"
sic.1200.d: "It appears that some of the troops guarding the port of Bari had yet to understand that their government had truly lost. Under their commander they valiantly attempted to hold the port in the pathetic hope their Bourbon King would save them but without support they gradually became drained of resources and surrendered. What shall be done with them?"

sic.1200.c: "Hard Labor for Life" 

sic.1210.t: "Sicily Resists"
sic.1210.d: "The Sicilian Mafia has been acting in conjunction with local rebels to oppose our rule over the region, with the Mafia being motivated by our attempts to confiscate their ill gotten gains and the rebels motivated largely by either demands for democracy or for us to cease our attacks on Catholicism. When only a small detachment of Legionaries or a Grail Knight enter the region they are ambushed so we must act in absolution. We could either put Sicily under siege and use our navy to block them from supplies until the rebel leaders turn themselves in or the population turns on them. Or we could land a garrison on the island to fight their way to the capital and eliminate all listed enemies, followed by hunting down rural mob bosses."
sic.1210.a: "Embargo"
sic.1210.b: "Take Palermo"

sic.1220.t: "Sicilians Broken"
sic.1220.d: "Sicily at long last no longer has the capacity to oppose our rule. With mobsters fleeing the area and rebels being starved out the region is now ours. But perhaps we should set an example?"

sic.1230.d: "While organized bandits still exist in these difficult economic times so too does the simple thief whom thinking of little more than their gluttonous desires disobeys our New Order and in the process debases both himself and the rest of society. What shall be the new penalty for a crime that can not be afforded when we battle the forces of chaos and nihilism themselves?"

sic.1240.d: "After spreading pro-House of Savoy propaganda and sending out diplomats to secure his arrival, King Emmanuel III has arrived in Naples via ship being greeted by Evola himself whom lavished praised on the King for his support of his cause. While the King does not seem enthusiastic about Evola's more revolutionary views he nonetheless lavished praise on him for his loyalty to the Aristocracy and his respectulfulness towards his majesty, noting that he and the Legion's undying loyalty will be repaid in full and the socialists will be pushed back into the French Commune."
sic.1240.a: "Long Live Emmanuel III!"
sic.1240.b: "Long Live Emmanuel III, hail his Baron Julius Evola!"

sic.1250.t: "The question of the Churches"
sic.1250.d: "With many priests whom are refusing to renounce Papal authority in favor of the King fleeing the area or disappearing the question of what to do with their churches remains. Any churches deemed abandoned are now under the control of King Emmanuel III, to the outrage of the Papacy. Baron Evola would like to repurpose them as Legion posts where ceremonies can be held but other proposals are to hand it to the Nobility as a reward for loyalty or allow the serfs to take them over. However some Legionaries have rejected each of these proposals and have stated that they should be stripped clean of their riches by the state then burned to the ground to help end Papal influence in Two Siciles, an alternative Evola himself does not seem opposed to. While the King is known to be anti-clerical and to have a hatred of the Pope's attempts to control him most are unsure he would go so far."

sic.1250.b: "For the Nobility"
sic.1250.c: "For the Serfs"
sic.1250.e: "Burn them down"

sic.1260.t: "Concubinage"
sic.1260.d: "With our enemies being felled and the repeal of "women's rights" as conceived by absurd liberalism, the Legion has become increasingly public about their advocacy of Warriors being able to take on concubines, either gifted by the King for their services or "won in war", a practice the Legion is rumored to secretly be practicing by passing them off off as "mistresses". Much of the cause of these demands are from Evola's denunciation of monogomy for being what he views as a means for women to enslave male virility to "Eros", claiming not only that classical civilizations allowed the practice but that the domination of women was a natural way of expressing the male spirit. On a practical level it would also allow for a faster growing population of Legionaries. While the King is surprised by this turn of events he is also well aware this could keep the Nobles happy if he instituted it just for them and this would have less impact on society. On the other hand he could inspire soldiers by allowing them to take concubines via conquest if their Commander allows it as well. What shall he do?"
sic.1260.a: "Only for Nobles"
sic.1260.b: "For Legion and Nobles"
sic.1260.c: "Soldiers are eligable as well"
sic.1260.e: "It's too radical just keep Monogomy"

sic.1270.t: "Catholics angered"
sic.1270.d: "Many traditional Catholics are to say the least not happy with our decision to utterly destroy the Papacy, claiming it amounts to essentially declaring a holy war on the Catholic Church. While many are too fearful to make a move the former Papal States have grown increasingly unstable. We could try to simply use the Knights of the Grail to calm the situation by attacking the loudest troublemakers but it would likely be more prudent to send in the military."
sic.1270.a: "Just Send Knights"
sic.1270.b: "Send the Military"

sic.1280.t: "Rebellion in Papal States"
sic.1280.d: "As predicted our efforts to eradicate the Church in the former Papal States have not gone over smoothly, with angered citizens and the former members of the Palatinate Guard whom refuse to serve the House of Savoy uniting to try to push out the Legion. We have lost a fair few soldiers already but it is obvious we will eventually retake the city as the rebels have no other support and are largely acting out of desperation. We could attempt to capture the city with the troops although we would likely lose many men in the process. Or, ironically, we could learn from the legacy of Cesare Borgia only with the Papacy on the receiving end this time and use artillery bombardment to force their surrender. Finally we could try to level the city completely, which will destroy the city completely with explosives followed by razing which will set a useful example in the future and finish off the rebels."
sic.1280.a: "Capture the City"
sic.1280.b: "Bombard it"
sic.1280.c: "Raze it"

sic.1290.t: "Emmanuel recognized as leader of Catholicism"
sic.1290.d: "The Platonic Council, made up largely of former clergy whom are preserving as much of Catholicism as they can and headed by a new pope, have gathered to crown King Emmanuel III the religious leader of the Catholic people, noting that the Church will now be in service to him. Of course the Catholic Church in exile have denounced them as "anti-Pope heretics" and refuse to accept this but it has nonetheless eased concern among some of our more traditional citizens."
sic.1290.a: "We move further from Kali Yuga"

sic.1300.t: "Recognize Alchemy"
sic.1300.d: "With Evola's faith of Tradition gaining increased presence among our state he has begged for us to establish a council of alchemists whom will work to study what he calls "ancient truths that can cast light on our age of darkness". While the King does not believe this he understands that it would gain the favor of the Legion and undermine traditional faith, and keep superstitious citizens fearful of their 'powers'."
sic.1300.a: "Very well"
sic.1300.b: "No"

sic.1310.t: "Rebuild the Colosseum?"
sic.1310.d: "The Radical Traditionalists have long thought it was nonsense to let the ancient ruins of Rome fall into disrepair, claiming that the this was treating the Roman Spirit as though it was dead when it is still alive but just needs help being revived in our spiritually dead age that denies the divine. A first stop for this would be that symbol of the Roman Empire's greatness and of warrior virtues, namely the Colosseum which they desire to seen rebuilt to its former glory. While it would be expensive there is little question that games hosted there would be popular."
sic.1310.a: "Fund it"
sic.1310.b: "Sounds Like a Waste"

sic.1320.t: "Colosseum Finished"
sic.1320.d: "The Colosseum has been brought back to its former glory, at least as far as architecture is concerned. To truly reflect Roman values we must allow battle to take place once again! Between prisoners, slaves and volunteers whom desire greatness. This will give those with noble spirits whom happened to be born into a lower caste a chance to demonstrate their true value and gain the recognition they deserve, and will provide the locals with plenty of entertainment as well as a taste for warfare."
sic.1320.a: "Gladiatorial Games it is"
sic.1320.b: "Gladiators and Chariots"
sic.1320.c: "Just hold ordinary events there"

sic.1330.t: "The King Attends the First Game"
sic.1330.d: "The King has decided to personally attend the first gladiatorial game with High Chancellor Evola at his side, a battle between a retiarius armed with a net and trident and a murmillo armed with a gladius and a scutum shield. They both fought well, however in the end the murmillo overcame the retiarius, pinning him to the floor with his foot. He then looked to the crowd and saw that nearly half of whom showed their thumbs to symbolize finishing the fallen foe with his sword, while the rest showed compressed fists that hid their thumb to symbolize sparing the man and sheathing the sword. Unsure of what to do he looked to the king to decide."
sic.1330.a: "He fought well, a compressed fist"
sic.1330.b: "He should've fought to the end, thumb up" 

sic.1340.t: "A Champion Emerges"
sic.1340.d: "In the gladiatorial ring those few whom have the potential to be truly brutal and courageous heroes are separated from the pseudo-masculine lowlifes. One such man, Francesco Calì, has emerged as a champion in the arena, surviving at least 18 games. A former soldier and footballer whom was arrested for being a suspected anti-Legion integralist supporter his Lord now looks upon him with great esteem and lavishly rewards him for his fighting ability. Perhaps it is time to reward him for good by making him a commander of the Legion?"
sic.1340.a: "Make him a Legion Commander"
sic.1340.b: "Keep him as a Lavished Fighter"

sic.1350.t: "Women's Role Enforced"
sic.1350.d: "The Law of Women's Stature has been passed, effectively meaning that women can no longer work in many industries, own land or choose their own husbands. The patriarch of the family now holds a monopoly on his household though some argue that we should at least allow women to be nurses and, as far as our Occultist followers are concerned, priestesses."
sic.1350.a: "They may be Priestesses or nurses"
sic.1350.b: "They are either wives or maids"

sic.1360.t: "Destroying Materialistic Hedonism"
sic.1360.d: "With our society establishing the norm of asceticism and fighting for what Baron Evola celebrates as the triumph of Roman values over fatalistic Etruscan ones many of the Knights have begun to sell off valuables that are viewed as overly ornate or comforting and are expecting citizens to do the same. Some of our followers have even begun to raid taverns that are viewed as promoting hedonistic activities that posses no higher spiritual value. This line-of-thinking includes overthrowing the remaining banks, corporations and foreign owned properties that are viewed as disloyal or corrupt and putting them under the Kings domain and destroying utterly useless 'technologies' such as television. All of the collected materials are seemingly going towards the military whenever possible."
sic.1360.a: "Excellent"

sic.1370.t: "Racial Laws Ordered"
sic.1370.d: "The Radical Traditionalists have long believed in a form of spiritual racism, in which blood contains the psychological elements of tradition and provides the life-force for a people. With this racial mixing has been banned and the Aryan-Roman has a clearly higher status than others within our territory. The question now remains of how to treat those of minority ancestry with two proposals given. One is to allow them to organize into their own hierarchies modeled on our values for those whom pledge loyalty to the King, pay tribute, pledge soldiers to our wars and acknowledge the Kings and his Nobles supremacy. This way we can use the best of the aristocratic spirit that exists amongst themselves for our own purposes. Or as Arthur Reghini and much of the Legion have strongly pushed for we could simply place them in our lowest class and let them prove themselves in combat when the time comes."
sic.1370.a: "Organize their hierarchies... loyal to ours"
sic.1370.b: "Their rightful place is always beneath us"
sic.1370.c: "It shall be a case by case basis"

sic.1380.t: "Corvee System"
sic.1380.d: "With our attacks on traditional capitalism and encroachment of a Caste system some of our serfs simply do not have the means of providing taxes to the Legion. However this is once again an opportunity to learn from our ancestors rather than institute a crude monetary system by instituting the Corvee System which will replace taxes for those whom can't pay them with required days of government directed labor. Corvees will have greater rights than the class beneath them, the slaves, but nonetheless are required to carry out their work. The labor this will provide us with will also allow our economy to exit the worst that Black Monday caused, for whatever that's worth."
sic.1380.a: "Consumerist woes will soon be behind us regardless"

sic.1390.t: "Sardinia Demanded"
sic.1390.d: "Two Sicilies under Ferdinand III have demanded the integration of Sardinia into their territory, with the letter noting that he represents the primary Savoyard line and that his exile was a temporary tactical retreat. He thanks Amadeo for holding the territory for the good of the royal house and notes he will be rewarded when he acknowledges the rightful King."
sic.1390.a: "We must accept"
sic.1390.b: "Never!"

sic.1400.t: "Sardinia Accepts"
sic.1400.d: "Unsurprisingly given his lack of legitimacy in the region, our Kings higher prestige, military advantage and our support even amongst his own nobles Amadeo has done what he should have weeks ago and accepted our offer. We may now integrate his Nobles into our Order and enforce Legion law there with Amadeo giving liberals and socialists three days to flee. Though the question of how to reward Amadeo remains... we could grant him Sardinia as a Duchy though as we are aware he would likely be a more liberal leader than we prefer, so we could simply make it a titular title and grant him wealth. Or we could give him the prestige of being in charge of a Legion garrison though again he would likely be too tied to modern forms of warfare."
sic.1400.a: "Give him the Duchy of Sardinia"
sic.1400.b: "The Duchy of Sardinia... in name only"
sic.1400.c: "Make him a Legion Commander"

sic.1410.t: "Sardinia Declines"
sic.1410.d: "In a grotesque display of treachery and lack of respect for his betters Amadeo has refused to integrate Sardinia into the Legion, calling the Legion "The King's mad dogs". While our King is furious Evola is pleased for a chance for the Legion to experience war."
sic.1410.a: "Take Sardinia NOW"
sic.1410.b: "We bide our time"

sic.1420.t: "Codreanu accepts"
sic.1420.d: "As expected the Iron Guard have accepted our offer to join together our forces against the agents of civilizational deterioration. What shall we call our alliance?"
sic.1420.a: "Legionary Union"
sic.1420.b: "European Spiritual Axis"
sic.1420.c: "Roman Alliance"
sic.1420.e: "Blood Courts Pact"

sic.1430.t: "Battle for Palermo"
sic.1430.d: "The battle for Palermo was bloody but finally we have managed to break the rebellion in the city and are now pushing our way into rural hideouts, interrogating any villagers suspected of working with them. With mobsters fleeing the area and rebels being destroyed the region is ours albeit it at a high cost. Nonetheless their loss has helped to demoralize resistance to our regime. But perhaps we should set more of an example?"
sic.1430.a: "Sicily is now a Legion outpost"
sic.1430.b: "Sicily is now our serfs"
sic.1430.c: "Just Purge all whom may be treacherous"

sic.1440.t: "Esoteric Developments"
sic.1440.d: "There have long been rumors has to Evola and his closest followers interest in magic and the esoteric but it seems that his views have spread to some of the Nobles and Legion members, whom are now taking an interest in reading his literature and gaining access to books that profess the new faith. Overall they are still a fringe but among those whom believe their support is strong, they practice asceticism and many in the Legion whom are superstituous are shifting towards such views."
sic.1440.a: "Support them"

sic.1450.t: "Occult Nobles"
sic.1450.d: "Seeing our increasing triumph in religious terms, an increasing number of Legion members and are said to be practicing occult rituals for good luck before battle and are growing stricter in their personal belief in and practice of Evola's Occultist Faith of Tradition. Even the Nobility whom follow Evolianism have taken an increasing interest in the faith and its fetishism of them."
sic.1450.a: "Excellent"

sic.1460.t: "Superstitious Citizens"
sic.1460.d: "Most of our citizens know little about the occultism present among much of the Legion and our loyal Nobility but with our growing success and the Religion of Tradition gaining traction at the expense of the Papacy many are beginning to believe in it to some degree, even if it is limited to fearing the magical powers of Evola and his inner circle or simply feeling that loyalty to the papacy is growing increasingly pointless. As such they are less willing to work with the enemy and even the common soldiers pay more respect to the faith despite its demanding nature."
sic.1460.a: "Wonderful!"

sic.1470.t: "Primordial Revival"
sic.1470.d: "The Faith of Tradition has become a true religious minority in our territory and the Kings word now at least rivals that of the Papacy among his followers. With many citizens hoping to appease the forces around them many are performing rituals for good luck and attempting to hex their enemies, and a syncretism of Catholicism and Evolian occultism has grown in prominence. Traditional followers of Catholicism are dismayed at this but are becoming increasingly reluctant to confront it as they are now uncertain of where even their own neighbors sympathies lay."
sic.1470.a: "As Long as They Don't Hex Us"

sic.1480.t: "King's Spiritual Power"
sic.1480.d: "The Papacy's monopoly over our populations spiritual life has finally been broken! The Kings word is followed by a large enough sect of the people, and nearly all of the Legion and Nobility, that he functionally has more influence that the Pope does within our society especially since the Papacy-in-exile has extreme difficulties communicating with their followers here. For those whom believe in the King they would gladly die in battle if he ordered them to."
sic.1480.a: "May He Live Forever!"

sic.1490.t: "Dominance of Evolian Tradition"
sic.1490.d: "We have finally revived the old world! Even though most of the population still holds private sympathies for Traditional Catholicism it has nonetheless been driven underground in favor the Religion of Tradition. Our military fights well knowing that higher powers watch over their every victory, many citizens observe the striptures of the Warrior-Priests out of fear of their powers and the next generation will be far less Catholic than their predecessors."
sic.1490.a: "Another Victory achieved"

sic.1500.t: "Prominent Catholic Resistance"
sic.1500.d: "It appears traditionalist Catholic resistance to our rule has grown."
sic.1500.a: "Modernist Death Throes"

sic.1510.t: "Catholic Rebellion"
sic.1510.d: "Our attempts to subvert the power of the church have devolved into riots against our government. We must act now as these devotees of slave morality attempt to subvert an actual transcendence for our people."
sic.1510.a: "Wipe them from the Earth!"

sic.1520.t: "Christian Resistance Damaged"
sic.1520.d: "The Catholic resistance has taken severe blows in recent days and fewer sympathizers to their cause believe they can succeed in destroying us."
sic.1520.a: "They will need to be instructed further"
sic.1520.b: "Let's Keep it up"

sic.1530.t: "Christian Rebels Neutralized"
sic.1530.d: "The Catholic resistance has at long last finally ceased to be a major threat. Many believe attempting to save the traditional papacy is a lost cause."
sic.1530.a: "At Long Last"

sic.1540.t: "Papal States retaken"
sic.1540.d: "While our methods are not without controversy Rome is nonetheless ours again after a mighty holy battle between the Legion and the modernist-wing of Catholicism."
sic.1540.a: "An example is set"

sic.155.t: "Sicily wants an alliance"
sic.155.d: "Citing our shared national-mysticism and enemies Two Sicilies under King Evola and Chancellor Evola desire an alliance with us."
sic.155.a: "Of course"
sic.155.b: "No"

sic.1560.t: "Pan Europa organized"
sic.1560.d: "The age of modernism and chaos is dead and gone as Europe is no longer run by either slaves or merchants but by its best! Our victory is final and eternal with all our remaining foes trembling at the sight of the Legion that remains fanatically loyal, and apart of, The New Order. What shall we call ourselves?"
sic.1560.a: "Pan Europa"
sic.1560.b: "The Aryan-Roman Imperium"

sic.1570.t: "The Return of Rome"
sic.1570.d: "We have retaken the lands of Italy from the socialists, Republicans, pretender kings and Papacy. With our power undeniable and our revival of the ancient spirit we can at last give Rome the dignity it deserves and continue its legacy under its name. But which would be most appropriate?"
sic.1570.a: "Kingdom of Rome"
sic.1570.b: "Roman Empire"
sic.1570.c: "Third Rome"

sic.1580.t: "Merchants beg for an exception"
sic.1580.d: "As apart of our battle against the encouragement of pointless softness that modern technology promotes most civilian vehicles are being taken by the Legion. However the Mercantilist class begs to have an exception made for them, noting they need these vehicles to move wares. While they are already being allowed to keep a handful of trucks Legion inspectors say is absolutely needed for supply they argue it would be more efficient for the economy if they let them keep more of their vehicles."
sic.1580.a: "Very Well"
sic.1580.b: "No Exceptions"

sic.1590.t: "Papal States demanded"
sic.1590.d: "The Papacy knew it was only a matter of time before the madness that has possessed Sicily came for them, especially after they moved to limit their influence in the region. We have received a demand to give up our autonomy under threat of war by those bastardos Emmanuel and Evola! However with socialists to our north many advisors are claiming we do not stand a chance and that leaving them Rome is the lesser of two evils while we evacuate clerics from the area. However others are claiming that Evola is a pagan and that we should go down fighting. What shall we do?"
sic.1590.a: "Surrender"
sic.1590.b: "We have God on our side! Fight!"

sic.1600.t: "Papacy Caves In" 
sic.1600.d: "Squeezed by enemies on all sides the Papacy decided it would be better to evacuate many of their bureaucrats and surrender the region to Victor Emmanuel III, a known longtime enemy of the church, rather than lose everything in a pointless war. However they still encouraged Catholics to resist the regime on the way out. Nonetheless it appears both Emmanuel and Evola have triumphed over their old for." 
sic.1600.a: "Finally!"

sic.1610.t: "The King and The Baron" 
sic.1610.d: "It appears as though the bond between King Emmanuel III and his High-Chancellor, Baron Julius Evola, has grown in recent months. The two hold many shared opinions on the King's powers and dignity, on culture and on the proper way of living ones life and both often unite in their hatred of the Catholic Church, liberals, socialists, politicians, progressives, democratic conservatives, Bourbons, anti-colonialists, republicans, "soft" men, insubordinate women and hedonists. Hunting trips, fishing and hiking are an increasingly common past-times for the two as they review stately material and has shifted the King into accepting even more right-wing positions than he hold before."
sic.1610.a: "A Model Friendship"

sic.1620.t: "The King's Passing" 
sic.1620.d: "To the great pain of the Legion and especially to his close political ally Julius Evola, King Victor Emmanuel III has passed on due to a heart attack. He will be entombed in the capital while his son, Umberto II, takes the throne with Evola remaining his advisor."
sic.1620.a: "Long Live Umberto II!"

sic.1630.t: "Legion Sympathies" 
sic.1630.d: "We have established fruitful relations with the Romanian Iron Guard, with a handful even being sent over to help us stabilize the situation. They have already agreed to our idea for a defensive alliance, something more of our advisors support as it will still allow us to be flexible in our foreign policy. Most legionaries would prefer an outright alliance led by Two-Siciles but our advisors are claiming we simply would not have the strength to fight all of our enemies between just the two of us and a defensive alliance is more practical."
sic.1630.a: "A Defensive Alliance"
sic.1630.b: "To hell with compromise, make an outright alliance!"

sic.1640.t: "The Black Prince"
sic.1640.d: "While the Papacy evacuated the Pope and bureaucrats to stay weary of the King its attempts to dissolve all of its military and navy so that it would not fall into the hands of Evola were less than successful thanks to the intervention of Junio Valerio Borghese, AKA the Black Prince. An aristocrat and ultra-rightist, Borghese was a Papal admiral whom secretely harbored strong Evolian sympathies and founded a small cell of officers whom decided that if the Papacy evacuated they would stand by Rome and, therefor, the King of Savoy. The cell volunteered to stay behind to secure the evacuation and once they had left told the military and navy they were now in the services of Two Sicilies. A true Warrior and hero, the Black Prince shall be made an admiral of repute for his loyalty despite the Catholic Church's hatred of him, whom are now doing all they can to convince the populace this "treachery" was planned in conjunction with the House of Savoy."
sic.1640.a: "A Great Man"

sic.1650.t: "The Black Prince"
sic.1650.d: "While the Papacy evacuated the Pope and bureaucrats its attempts to dissolve all of its military and navy so that it would not fall into the hands of Evola were less than successful thanks to the intervention of Junio Valerio Borghese, AKA the Black Prince. An aristocrat and ultra-rightist, Borghese was a Papal admiral whom secretely harbored strong Evolian sympathies and founded a small cell of officers whom decided that if the Papacy evacuated they would stand by Rome and, therefor, the King of Savoy. When war broke out he commanded his navy to withhold attacking whenever possible and as soon as possible handed them over to Two-Sicilies rather than evacuate them as ordered. Considered by the Legion a true Warrior and hero, the Black Prince shall be made an admiral of repute for his loyalty despite the Catholic Church's hatred of him."
sic.1650.a: "A Great Man"

sic.1660.t: "Prominent Catholic Resistance"
sic.1660.d: "It appears Catholic and conservative resistance to our rule has grown."
sic.1660.a: "Modernist Death Throes"

sic.1670.t: "Christian Resistance Damaged"
sic.1670.d: "The Catholic resistance has taken severe blows in recent days and fewer sympathizers to their cause believe they can succeed in destroying us."
sic.1670.a: "They will need to be instructed further"

sic.1680.t: "The Insult"
sic.1680.d: "Count Paolo Ignazio Maria Thaon di Revel is a high-ranking count, longtime Legion member and loyal absolute monarchist whom, unbelievably, has been insulted by a younger Legion member whom has called his competetance into question and bragged he could do his tasks far better. It appears the Count heard about this and as a known champion fencer has requested the chance the duel the young man to the first blood or, failing that, the death. There is no question the Count would win and Evola has advised the King to allow it for the King's time is too important to micromanage every petty dispute of honor among the upper-class and that duels will encourage a culture of "truth, bravery and honor". More cautious on-lookers think the King should let his Court of Advisors simply settle these types of disputes themselves when the King does not have the time or desire to manage them."
sic.1680.a: "Allow Dueling"
sic.1680.b: "No Duels, the council will settle it"

sic.1690.t: "Peasants Revolt Suppressed" 
sic.1690.d: "In the capital of Calabria, Catanzaro, some of the serfs had yet to fully accept their place in the New Order and under the inspiration of an anti-Evolian poet named Filippo De Nobili decided revolt was their best chance, hoping it would inspire others to destroy our most Noble Beings. This failed of course but due to our reputation they decided to fight to the last man and women which made it especially costly to us, with the event already being called the Pillage of Catanzaro. More pressingly however the revolt only seemed to get out of hand because local soldiers decided to retreat instead of fighting them as ordered by their legionary commanders! We will need to set a precendent to make sure this does not happen again. The most popular proposal is to revive the Roman practice of decimatio, in which all of the disobedient soldiers will draw from a lottery and the ten percent who get the "losing straws" will be beaten to death by their comrades. Less popular proposals include leaving it in the hand of the commanders of themselves at the cost of the King's authority or wiping out every coward which, while tempting, would cost us much cannon fodder in our war against socialism. Of course this will also be setting a precedent for the future." 
sic.1690.a: "Decimatio it is"
sic.1690.b: "Leave it up to the commanders"
sic.1690.c: "Get rid of them all"

sic.1700.t: "Fall of Piedmont"
sic.1700.d: "The bastion of so-called Italian syndicalism is in our hands, demonstrating the superiority of our moral fiber. We must finish off our ultimate enemies while we can, namely the syndicalists whom destroy our flesh with their weapons and (even more dangerously) the "Christian Socialists" whom seek to destroy our Spirit through their disgusting advocacy of egalitarian-pacificism." 
sic.1700.a: "Socialism here is finished"
