## Ideas ##
MLT_langaune_question:0 "The Language Question"
MLT_langaune_question_desc:0 "One of the most pivotal questions of the current Maltese political scene, the Language Question, concerns the very future of every soul in the nation. With Malta long being the play thing of outside powers, her own culture reflects that. Influences from the British, Italians, and even the Germans can be felt everywhere one looks. While this has created a unique melting pot of cultures, due to the fact that not one these influences is fully in command, it has also caused great strife, further egged on by Germany's decision to remove English and Italian as official languages and add German to the list in 1930, leaving Maltese and German as the sole official languages of our island and inflaming tensions across the archipelago. All major parties within Malta argue for adopting their preferred major language, so that they can finally put this question to rest. With the rise of the New Sons however, this question, like all things has been put on hold, seemingly permanently."

MLT_republicanismonrise:0 "Pangs of Republicanism"
MLT_republicanismonrise_desc:0 "Since 1921, when Germany first gained control over Malta and restored the Sovereign Military Order of Malta to power over the archipelago, the people have lacked a truly democratic way to express themselves. While the 1930 elections did much to calm these calls for a return to democracy, the sudden rise of the New Sons and their paralyzing effect on the nation practically undid all good that came from it. Even with the New Sons in effective power, these calls for democracy carry on, seemingly as a way to parrot that Malta is not under the control of a sole entity."

MLT_commie_cells:0 "Socialist Cells"
MLT_commie_cells_desc:0 "Despite Malta's overwhelming Catholic and conservative population, some socialist cells within the Labour Party, rumored to have strong ties to the near-by Socialist Republic of Italy do exist. While posing little threat even before the New Sons come to be, if and when the New Sons should falter in their control over our fair isles, they could present a significant risk to our security."

MLT_blind_garrison:0 "The Blind Garrison"
MLT_blind_garrison_desc:0 "Present since 1921 and further bolstered in 1924, the Kasierreich's Malta Garrison has been effectively blind to the true ongoings of our state since the rise of the New Sons six years ago. Keeping the Kaiserreich ignorant with disappearances and bribery, the New Sons have duped the German Empire into thinking everything is function normal on our little archipelago, regardless of how actually paralyzed the local garrison is. Despite their blindness, the Garrison is still our only true defense against the outside world, and should Malta ever overstep, it can be assured that the Garrison would intervene, to protect the Kaiser's Mediterranean prize." 
MLT_sons_of_malta_base:0 "The ''New Sons of Malta''"
MLT_sons_of_malta_base_desc:0 "The ‘New’ Sons of Malta are a contemporary facsimile of the original Independent Order of the Sons of Malta, a fraternal organization similar to the Freemasons that was active during 1800s as a mystic secret society with many prominent politicians and world figures being members of its ranks. A far cry from this noble and harmless past, the New Sons are a group of pretenders - rich, powerful, and well connected men working together to pursue their own selfish agenda on a global scale. Using their vast fortunes and influence, these deluded dreamers have seized control of the archipelago of Malta after Germany loosened its grip in 1930. Since then, this shadowy cabal of cowardly businessmen and spoiled aristocrats have masqueraded as ne'er-do-wells and masterminds bent on freeing their home isles from German control by controlling the strings of the Kaiserreich from its dark underbelly. In reality, the New Sons have only managed to gain a small amount of influence within Germany's FAUD and among her investment banking class,  making their "Grand Plan" seemingly a pipe dream. In short, the New Sons may have been able to fool the naive and the poor citizens of Malta these long six years, but it seems they are destined to exposure and failure. Until then however, Malta is locked in their greedy vice, waiting for the moment that their future comes knocking..."

MLT_to_bring_down_an_empire:0 "To Bring Down an Empire"
MLT_to_bring_down_an_empire_desc:0 "The yoke of the Hohenzollern cancer has spread to our once proud island and now holds us as a playpen for “protection from the syndicalists” when we are little more than another possession of them. But the Maltese spirit shall not be destined to be chained down. Our order plants the seeds of devastation that will open up the chance for our freedom."
MLT_wild_cat_strikes:0 "Spark Wildcat Strikes!"
MLT_wild_cat_strikes_desc:0 "For the past several years since the end of the Weltkerig, if not even before, the economy of the Kaiserreich has been failing. Be it a stagnant world economy, the crashing of Wall Street, or even just the Reich's own overgrowth, her economy is headed for a recession. While such a thing will obviously come sooner or later, by using our influence within the FAUD to trigger wildcat strike around Germany, we could push the final domino down, and finally be able to enact our Grand Plan to free our isles!"
MLT_invester_pullout:0 "Spark Panic Pullouts!"
MLT_invester_pullout_desc:0 "For the past several years since the end of the Weltkerig, if not even before, the economy of the Kaiserreich has been failing. Be it a stagnant world economy, the crashing of Wall Street, or even just the Reich's own overgrowth, her economy is headed for a recession. While such a thing will obviously come sooner or later, by using our influence with the many investors within Germany, we could spark a round of panic pullouts and buyouts, possibly pushing the final domino down, and allowing us to finally be able to enact our Grand Plan to free our isles!"
MLT_our_chance:0 "A Chance for Freedom"
MLT_our_chance_desc:0 "Success! The German economy is in shambles, and her empire is at last vulnerable after years of waiting. Regardless if it was our intervention that caused Black Monday, our chance is finally here, and we cannot waste it!"
MLT_the_socialists:0 "Readying the Socialists"
MLT_the_socialists_desc:0 "The Socialists of Malta are far and few between, mostly hidden within the depths of the Labour Party. Regardless of this fact, they still make up part of Malta, and thus part of the Grand Plan. To ensure the Grand Plan's success, we must get the Socialists ready to go on strike, to cripple the Garrison's ability to get any items."
MLT_ready_the_revolution:0 "The Revolution on Standby"
MLT_ready_the_revolution_desc:0 "For the Grand Plan to work, the Socialists and their working class contacts must be on constant alert, ready to answer the call to action at any time of day. The Revolution simply must be on standby if we are to have any chance for victory."
MLT_the_knights:0 "Preparing the Knights"
MLT_the_knights_desc:0 "The Knights of Malta have long been the de-facto rulers of Malta since she fell under the Kaiser's boot following the British Revolution. While their numbers are small, and they are not what they used to be, the Knights still hold much valor. While their part in the Grand Plan is small, it is vital, and thus they must be prepared."
MLT_prep_crusade:0 "Awaken the Crusader Spirit"
MLT_prep_crusade_desc:0 "The Knights of Malta have the luxury of being one of the few orders of Crusaders still in existence. With a proven history of connection to the old Kingdom of Jerusalem, many younger members of the Order long to reclaim the Holy Land. By awaking this spirit, by painting the Germanic heretics as simply the first step in restoring Outremer, we can prepare them for the part they shall play in the Grand Plan."
MLT_the_republicans:0 "Frenzy the Republicans"
MLT_the_republicans_desc:0 "The various political parties of Malta, be it the Nazzjonalista or the Kostituzzjonali, are the most important peice of the Grand Plan. While their place in the actual liberation of Malta will be small to nonexistence, the post liberation world is a much different matter. They shall form the basis of our new civilzation, giving the people a true voice with the halls of power, thus they must be frenzied, and ready to act as soon as the time is ripe."
MLT_rally_republic:0 "Rally the People"
MLT_rally_republic_desc:0 "The people, the ones we are fighting for, are the future of our state. If we want to have any chance of success against kicking the perfidious Germans out of our land, we must rally and provoke the common folk. Only with their support and arms, can we kick out the Huns."

MLT_democratic_mandate:0 "A Democratic Mandate"
MLT_democratic_mandate_desc:0 "For the second time in Maltese history, truly democratic elections have finally taken place. No longer is the government of Malta something imposed by a foreign power, or enforced by a shadow organization. The people of Malta have finally spoken, and their voices have at last finally be heard. Never again will the people of Malta be governed by anyone but themselves."
MLT_nat:0 "A Nationalist Victory"
MLT_nat_desc:0 "Having been elected in a landslide majority in the elections of 1930, it comes as little shock that the Partit Nazzjonalista secured victory in Malta's second elections. Riding to power on a platform that wishes to codify the existing status quo, the Nazzjonalista strive to protect the Church's place in society and promote closer ties with Italy. The Party also pushes for a hardline against the dwindling British and German presence in Malta, as there is only one true motherland for the Maltese people, Italy. "
MLT_ensure_churches_place:0 "Safeguard Holy Mother Church"
MLT_ensure_churches_place_desc:0 "The Church and the Maltese State have always existed as intertwined entities. The Church commands and the State listens. While this state of affairs was once common throughout Eurupe, since the dawn of the enlightenment, it is becoming less and less the case. In this modern age, only Malta, Italy and perhaps Austria can brag about maintaining the basis of Christendom. To ensure that this Holy and Blessed state of affairs never wavers, the Partit Nazzjonalista has moved to enshrine the Church's place in a newly drafted Maltese constitution. Even despite the wishes of an increasingly secular world, never again shall Mother Church's place be threatened! "
MLT_anti_angloid:0 "Rabid Anti-Anglophilia"
MLT_anti_angloid_desc:0 "The Partit Nazzjonalista is the heir to one of Malta's first political parties, the Anti-Reform Party, which was founded as a way to combat England's attempts to remove Italian and the Church from Malta. Due to this, Anglophobia is within the Party's very DNA. As such, the Party has moved to do away with many of the remaining institutions and laws that were created during England's reign. On top of this, schools shall teach the youth the truth of those Imperialist war dogs that once threatened our great island. By doing this, we can ensure that never again will the Anglo rule Malta."
MLT_what_do_knights:0 "The Final Fate of Malta's Stoic Guardians"
MLT_what_do_knights_desc:0 "For nearly two hundred years, the Knights of Malta had ruled over our fair isle, until their eviction by the Emperor of the French in 1798. Since then, the Order of Saint John had existed in a strange limbo, technically being a sovereign entity, but not controlling any territory. This would come to an end following the Weltkrieg, where Germany would formally reinstate the Knights as the lords of Malta, both as a way to keep the population happy by having Catholic leadership and to be able to keep a strong hand . With the fall of the New Sons and with elections creating a popular government, the Knights, once again, have entered into a state of limbo. While technically still ruling over Malta, since the elections, the government of [root.getleader] has ruled every aspect of the island. With this being the case, the time has come for the Partit Nazzjonalista to decide just what to do with Malta's protectors."
MLT_a_pious_and_maltese_malta:0 "A Malta Worthy of Saint Paul's Legacy"
MLT_a_pious_and_maltese_malta_desc:0 "Saint Paul himself is the man who brought the faith of Christ to these fair shores. In almost every aspect of our culture, St. Paul is honored in some way. In recent years however, be it due to perfidious Albion, the New Sons or even the Knights themselves, Malta has been unworthy to even whisper St. Paul's name. With the rise of the Partit Nazzjonalista however, this has changed. Malta is no longer stagnant, under the thumb of a great power. Finally, Malta is a free nation, under God. At long last, we are truly worth to be Saint Paul's proudest children."
MLT_nationalistic_democracy:0 "A Uniquely Maltese Democracy"
MLT_nationalistic_democracy_desc:0 "Despite some calls within the Party to do away with democracy wholesale, this cannot be. While we may take a hard stance against liberalism, democracy is still perhaps the best way for us to maintain a popular mandate. Due to this, we shall maintain the democratic process. However, this does not mean that Maltese democracy will be a pure one. Far from it in fact, as if there is one thing that allows the demonic to enter government, it is unfettered access to the ballot box. To ensure that our democratic process does not fall into the Devil's traps, we shall implement various safeguards. While other parties will be able to still come to power, they shall do so under vicarious observation, staffed by clergy of Holy Mother Church. Maltese democracy shall be like no other on Earth, as ours shall be protected by God Himself. "
MLT_march_on_valletta:0 "The March on Valletta"
MLT_march_on_valletta_desc:0 "While coming to power on the back of the democratic process, it is becoming increasingly clear that since coming to power, factionalism and divide within the party has grown a thousandfold. While the causes for this factionalism are practically endless, under the leadership of [root.getleader], it is clear that the largest cause is democracy itself. For if one could lose their power by not constantly making promises, by changing the platform to appeal to the masses, factionalism becomes evident. Due to this, [root.getleader] has declared that democracy can no longer stand. Deciding that the easiest way to end democracy is by way of self-coup, the Tal-Ġakketta Blu has been ordered to march into Valletta and arrest oppositional leadership and dissolve their parties. By the end of the day, the Maltese state shall be the Partit Nazzjonalista, and the Partit Nazzjonalista shall be the state"
MLT_normie_nat:0 "Tradition Secured by the Orthodox Nazzjonalista"
MLT_normie_nat_desc:0 "Following a closely fought battle during the primaries following the elections, the orthodox and old guard faction of the Nationalist Party was elected to lead the party into the future. Under the watchful eye of Enrico Mizzi, the Party shall protect Holy Mother Church, the family and traditional Maltese values. In other words, the Party shall safeguard the status quo, come hell or high water."
MLT_demonize_lefty_cells:0 "Destroy the Demonic Leftists"
MLT_demonize_lefty_cells_desc:0 "While the overwhelming majority of Malta's population are conservative Catholics, a small number of syndicalist or otherwise socialist cells exist throughout our fair isles. These cells are nothing but the Devil attempting to worm his way into one of the few truly Catholic nations left on Earth. To combat this, Enrico Mizzi has authorized the police in tandem with the Tal-Ġakketta Blu to hunt down and destroy Leftism from the face of Malta. We shall never bend to the Red Menace, nor its Devilish master!"
MLT_the_holy_status_qup:0 "The Holy Status Quo"

Made up mostly of ex-police officers, the Tal-Ġakketta Blu have acted mostly as security during Party events, such as rallies. With the youth wing in power, the government has moved to make the Tal-Ġakketta Blu an official arm of the state. By granting these already ex-policemen power to enforce the law once again, we can ensure the people of Malta truly live up to the example the Party wishes them to. The fact that the Blueshirts also work directly against the Labour and Constitutionalists is just a happy accident. After all, Malta is a democratic state, no?"
MLT_maltese_syncertism:0 "Put an End to Nazzjonalista Syncretism"
MLT_maltese_syncertism_desc:0 "While the Youth Wing of the Nationalist Party is dedicated to destroying degenerates and socialists alike, the true unity of the wing falls apart shortly after. Due to Malta's position within the crossroads of empires, influences from Legionarism, Maurrassisme, Right Syndicalism and even Integralism can be felt. Due to this, the Party under the Youth Wing has entered a period of mass disunity, over which ideology is fit for Malta. To end this sad state of affairs, George Borg Olivier has called for a Party Congress, to finally decide the ideological direction of the Partit Nazzjonalista going forward."

We are now free to shape our military forces according to our own strategic objectives and priorities to safeguard the Maltese people's interests. Reforms are desperately needed within our command structures to improve efficiency and effectiveness in our battle plans. This is if Malta's sovereignty is threatened. It is also crucial that we upgrade our obsolete equipment and technology to meet any challenges that may descend upon our shores and to repel them successfully. For now, our force is small and fledgling, but it is the first and only line of defense we have, and it will be sharpened to be deadly."

As a result, general conscription notices will be prepared and issued in phases. While conscription will lead to some resentment within our general population, a nation's strength and resilience depend on its manpower. With growing tensions far away on distant shores, it is necessary to move away from our dependence on volunteers to ensure Malta's defense readiness. We can also utilize conscripts for various projects such as Malta's construction and industry sectors. These sectors will need significant assistance and monumental effort to be ready for future endeavors, including war if it ever comes to our doorstep."
MLT_begin_navy_reforms:0 "Towards a Truly Maltese Navy"
MLT_begin_navy_reforms_desc:0 "With one of the grandest armadas assembled since antiquity, the Ottoman Turks descended upon Malta in droves during the memorable and frightful Great Siege of Malta in 1565. Their fleet consisted of nearly 200 vessels, hosting 40,000 marauders who intended to wipe Malta off the face of the earth. Before European relief arrived and forced the Ottoman Turks into a shattered retreat, Malta held for four months with 6,000 brave souls. In order to ensure that such an initiative is once again championed by any foe that may make such a similar mistake in invading Malta, another line of defense will need to be established. An independent Maltese navy will form the basis of this line of defense. This will ensure that no enemy combatant steps foot on our shores. However, whatever limited shipbuilding facilities or dockyards within the Grand Harbor that we possess are inherited from British efforts prior to the Weltkrieg. It is with these facilities that we will lay the groundwork for the establishment of the Maltese navy, with the arming of fishing trawlers."
MLT_modernization_of_da_guns:0 "Modernize the Garrison's Firepower"
MLT_modernization_of_da_guns_desc:0 "Since our reform efforts, Maltese garrisons have faced critical weaponry issues. This is largely due to Malta's armories not being well maintained for decades. Furthermore, the German garrisons did not leave anything useful behind, leaving behind equipment dating back to the Weltkrieg. This has led to a majority of the equipment being unusable and unreliable. To make matters worse, the garrisons have had difficulty procuring new equipment and supplies due to the limited budget of the Maltese military. The garrison is, however, updated to match contemporary standards by obtaining weapons from other nations. We can at least replace outdated weaponry with unused stockpiles from other nations soon enough. This will allow the Maltese garrison to have an up-to-date arsenal and stand a better chance of fighting anyone who dares to invade Malta."
MLT_defenive_army:0 "A Purely Defensive Force"
MLT_defenive_army_desc:0 "For all of our efforts, there is no desire that a son of Malta will ever be sent off to foreign shores to fight in a conflict on a similar scale to the first Weltkrieg. The priority is established - Malta and its isles are the only redoubts worthy of withstanding a siege for. No Kaiser nor Chairman is worth a thousand of Malta's sons. In preparation for plausible amphibious landings against Malta, bunkers will be built on the shores and doctrines will be prepared and intensely drilled. Coastal patrols will occur daily and both anti-aircraft artillery and coastal battery emplacements will be constructed. With its garrison ready to deal with any attempt to breach Malta, the island will be an impregnable fortress of the Mediterranean."
MLT_army_of_invade:0 "The Best Defense..."
MLT_army_of_invade_desc:0 "In spite of our wishes or in our best interest, Malta must now prepare for combat not only within its own realm, but also beyond. However, Malta's sons are not expendable by any means, and as such, we will need to ensure that any operation we undertake is strategic and precise. We must also be aware of our limitations and act accordingly, understanding that our soldiers' lives are of the utmost importance. Our officer corps has already begun learning amphibious war doctrines to avoid bloody waters on foreign shores during any beach assault. In addition, they will have the proper equipment needed to minimize casualties and succeed in their mission. Amphibious warfare is not the only means we can use to gain a upper hand on our enemy, but also vertical envelopment - death from above. Jumping out of an airplane is one of the safest things a man can do, provided he follows proper procedure. The Air Wing has already started several experiments concerning deployment from aircraft, seeing large success with an initial batch of volunteers. With these developments, we can create a force that can do an infinite deal of mischief against our enemies before they even have a chance of repelling us."

Therefore, it is necessary to bolster another line of defense to Malta's sovereignty - an independent air corps to take to the skies and allow Malta to become an unsinkable aircraft carrier in the middle of the Mediterranean."

However, we're living in a world that's blowing itself to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it. We will again need to defend our stronghold. We are confident that our legacy and Military Prowess will be an invaluable asset in the fight.

MLT_build_up_eco:0 "Building up the Maltese Economy"
MLT_build_up_eco_desc:0 "While Malta's economy isn't as large as its European counterparts, it remains stable - but stagnant. The past century witnessed Malta's economy flourish and prosper due to the Napoleonic Wars as it became a major trading hub within the Mediterranean. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 also greatly benefitted Malta with the Mediterranean becoming the "world highway of trade", not to mention that we were already a base of operations for the British Mediterranean Fleet and a coaling station for vessels sailing from beyond the Canal. However, at the dawn of the 20th century, Malta found its former prosperity declining worryingly as ships switched from coal to oil and grew in size. This has led to the rate of port calls in Malta shrinking, as we can no longer accommodate these ships with our facilities. As a result, we must start looking at expanding the economic sector to gradually shift away from our reliance on the port - there have been several suggestions but expanding our maritime facilities, nurturing a tourist economy, and even banking are the most prevalent ones."
MLT_expand_great_harbor:0 "Expand the Great Harbor"
MLT_expand_great_harbor_desc:0 "To begin shifting Malta away from its reliance on its ports, it is ironically critical to initiate renovations of the facilities present at our ports. This is so that it can accommodate the tonnage of most maritime vessels present in the Mediterranean - namely cargo ships and oil tankers. This is also the first significant step to allowing us to slowly rebuild our economic prosperity. We have also acquired private investors from surrounding nations to finance these efforts. This has allowed us to begin the process of constructing upgraded jetties and docks to further enhance the efficiency of our ports, enabling them to receive larger vessels. Surrounding businesses in these areas have likewise been renovated to attract sailors during port calls. Hopefully, this investment will yield long-term benefits for our ports and the local economy."

The fueling stations in Malta will be renovated and expanded in order to accommodate most sea traffic passing by. We also plan to add new ports and harbors to further accommodate larger ships from all over the world. This will allow us to increase trade and tourism, further increasing our prosperity. Finally, we plan to finish modernize our existing ports and harbors to ensure efficient operations, along with a dry dock to also allow for maintenance operations and ship repairs. All these plans will be funded by both the government and private investors, with the goal of creating a modern and efficient port infrastructure. This will ensure that we can keep up with the demands of modern shipping and provide a safe harbor for all vessels that come through our waters."

As a result, we have had to rely on importing most of our foodstuffs for most of our history. In order to preserve some self-determination, we are looking into expanding our aquaculture sector to expand our fishing industry. The Mediterannean hosts a massive variety of wealth of natural creations of which we can surely increase our catch from - especially the Atlantic Bluefin tuna. We are hoping to increase our catch of this species through the construction of additional fisheries and subsidies to fishermen in order to provide more sustainable food sources for our people. Additionally, we will be able to export the fish to other countries, providing economic benefits to our country."

MLT_increase_supply_runs_desc:0 "Even though our aquaculture expansion has had some limited success, it is not sufficient to stabilize Malta's food security long-term. As a result, we must take advantage of our close proximity to shipping lanes and increase our imports of grains and foodstuffs from foreign nations. This will limit the strain placed on local farmers for the time being. We must also develop long-term strategies to increase our agricultural production capacity to some extent and secure our food supply for the future, as conflict looms on the horizon. To stockpile wheat and other grains, we will contact nations such as France, Italy, and Ukraine to determine whether agreements can be reached to aid us in our precarious situation. In order to support this initiative, the government will fund the construction and purchase of several cargo vessels. This will ensure that our food supply routes remain secure, and that no one in Malta remains hungry."

mlt.1.t:0 "A Future in Flux"
mlt.1.d:0 "After years of instability and decay gnawed away at their flimsy foundations, the New Sons of Malta have finally been ousted, and with them gone, their facade government had collapsed. Our archipelago now stands at the precipice of its new future, for citizens across Malta could easily wake up to one of two very different realities as the power vacuum rushes to be filled. \n\nThe two main groups currently holding the strength, ties, and support necessary to seize power peacefully with the support of at least a decent percent of the population are the Republicans, rallying around three main democratic parties, and the Knights of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. With the SMOM’s reputation as a German interest group growing, they may experience some pushback, but with the rising Socialist tendencies within some groups inside the Labour party, they may be needed to keep Malta from Socialism. We must tread carefully, for our destiny is dawning, and we best make the right choices now so as to not sully our new found freedom."
mlt.1.a:0 "Begin to organize elections! The Repubblika ta’ Malta shall be reaffirmed!"
mlt.1.b:0 "For stability and piety, the Knights wrest control as the false Sons fall."

mlt.2.t:0 "The Riots of St. Paul’s Bay"
mlt.2.d:0 "With the Sovereign Military Order of Malta’s decision to retain the reins of power in Malta and not give way to democratic practices, the various republican elements around our archipelago began to riot, particularly in the capital of Veletta. However, just a few miles away, a far larger uprising was growing in St. Paul’s Bay, Malta’s largest and most industrialized city. Long a hotspot for Socialist thought, especially among the intelligentsia and the local dockhands and factory workers, St. Paul’s Bay is now engulfed in popular uprising as the local Socialist cells, riled up and antagonized to action by the Knights and by their new allies in Socialist Italy. This uprising, bringing with it a mass general strike, has crippled Malta’s fledgling economy, and the Knights must act soon if they have any hope at stopping the Red Menace. With their weapons at the ready, the Knights dived into the heart of the city to try to save it from this foreign-backed crimson tide."
mlt.2.a:0 "The Knights are crushed by SRI marines, and the Red Star rises over Malta."
mlt.2.b:0 "The Socialists are routed before their SRI allies can save them."

mlt.3.t:0 "Labour Party Internal ‘Elections’"
mlt.3.d:0 "With the first free elections since 1917 nearing on the horizon, the Partit Laburista has called for an internal leadership election to decide the new face and direction of the party. With Paul Boffa’s reputation preceding him, much of the main body of the Labourists joined in with his camp without second thought. However, the rising radical faction led avowed Socialist Dominic Mintoff has seen skyrocketing support, and now poses a serious threat to Boffa’s long standing dominance. More concerningly, these ‘Radikali’ have been reported to not even be true Labourists at all, instead being infiltrators from the various Socialist and Syndicalist cells that stalk Malta, though these reports have been from our contacts in the SMOM and it is not known if we can truly trust them. Driven on in secret through funding from Socialists in Italy, these Radicals have long duped their partymates, and now may even have the power to seize the Labour nomination. With the final tally of the internal elections being counted, it is only a matter of time before the decision is made and the party’s fate is sealed. Let us hope the warnings from the Knights did not go unheeded."
mlt.3.a:0 "The Radikali under Mintoff wrests control of the party in secret."
mlt.3.b:0 "Party Leader Boffa holds on and disperses the Radikali."

mlt.4.t:0 "Nationalist Party Internal Elections"
mlt.4.d:0 "As the landmark elections near ever closer, the Partit Nazzjonalista have announced that they will be holding an internal election of their own to determine the future direction of the party. Unlike in the Labour Party, the main man in the PN is Enrico Mizzi without question, for only he has the respect and influence to get the disparate groups within the modern PN to cooperate. What these internal elections shall instead decide is who shall come to form the bulk of Mizzi’s cabinet should he be elected. Within the NP lies three major factions who stand a shot at earning Mizzi’s favour. The Ċentristi are the mainstay of the NP party, and form the bulk of its base. Priding themselves on Catholic conservatism and tradition, they are supported by much of the traditional and rural population, as well as being supported through foreign channels by the Italian Federation and the Pope. Their main opponent are the Knights themselves, whose Sovereign Military Order of Malta has long been the lords of our archipelago, but have lost respect over the years due to their bending to Germany and their ineffectiveness in stopping the New Sons of Malta. The darkshorse candidates are from the ‘Kavallieri Radikali’ - a group of radical and extremist Knights from the Order that long for past glories, holding their love in the Lord above all. These three varied groups must court Mizzi and his allies if they wish to have a shot at ruling our islands."
mlt.4.a:0 "The moderate Ċentristi win out."

mlt.4.c:0 "The darkhorse Kavallieri Radikali seizes control of the NP."

mlt.5.t:0 "Constitutionalist Party Internal Elections"
mlt.5.d:0 "Finally, following suit with the other democratic parties, the Partit Kostituzzjonali have announced their intention to hold internal elections. Like the PN, the PK has one main figure at its head capable of unifying its disparate factions - Baron Gerald Strickland. Remaining here after the fall of the British Empire to protect the remaining Anglos unable to flee the island as London fell to the reds and as German marines arrived on Malta, the 1st Baron Strickland is a capable, if aging, leader that has long kept the remaining British souls left in this archipelago from splitting apart. Within the PK lies two major wings - the Konservatiivi and the Liberali - both vying to form the majority of Strickland’s cabinet. Both seeking returned ties to the Entente and the British Crown, the groups mainly differ in their economic and social policies, with the Liberali being more progressive and populist while the Konservatiivi are far more concerned with the free proliferation of capitalism, though both are still rather conservatrve by any moderate metric. Whichever side wins out shall join Stickland to represent the few Anglos left on this tiny archipelago for their chance at returning home."

The stage is set, and the candidates and our citizens are ready for true democracy to return to our island paradise. Though we still exist in a state of relative chaos and disarray, we hope that this election shall mark the first step on our road to recovery. With the final votes being counted now, it is only a matter of time before the Repubblika ta’ Malta shall be fully reborn!"

mlt.7.t:0 "The Knights Make Their Move"
mlt.7.d:0 "With the shocking victory of Dom Mintoff and his Socialist Radikali who have long been infiltrating the Partit Laburista with support from the Italian Socialist Republic, the Knights of the SMOM have sprang to action to try to defend their bastion of tradition. Launching raids against the Socialist stronghold of St. Paul’s Bay, the Sovereign Order hopes to dislodge this vile threat before the SRI’s marines can land to relieve the militias and small Socialist cells. As Grand Master Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere gave the order however, reports came in that the Socialists under Mintoff and his extremist ally Carmelo Borg Pisani had invaded and fully seized the islands of Gozo and Comino, isolating the Knights to just the main island of Malta proper save for the small islands of Filfla, Cominotto, and in St. Paul’s Bay inlet, where the Knight’s standing fortresses have kept the Socialist at bay. The island is in a state of all out war, and it is only a matter of time before the dust will settle and one group stands alone."

mlt.8.t:0 "The Small, Shining Jewel of the Mediterranean"
mlt.8.d:0 "The small but stalwart archipelago of Malta has a long and storied history of constantly falling under the sway of different foreign powers. Whether it be the Sicilian Arabs of the long-gone Emirate or the French and British who both had their time as lords over this paradise within the Mediterranean, the islands rarely have been allowed to live their own way, and when they have, it was usually under the watch of the historic and heroic Knights of Malta. \n\nHowever, the Knights have fallen far from grace, and now largely exist as pro-German sycophants - a husk of their past power save for the few circles of radicals that still cling to the old ways. Led by the 76th Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere-Albani, the SMOM re-surged to national prominence as the heralds of the new German occupation following the fall of the British Empire. Allied and heavily backed by the Kaiserreich and its new Maltese Garrison, the Knights ruled as a soft military government while Germany mainly used the islands as an airstrip. This military government largely held on unopposed on the surface, but across the underground of Malta, Republican protests and Socialist agents worked to undermine their rule at every turn. Meanwhile, the infamous and perfidious New Sons of Malta worked from deeper in the shadows, pulling the strings from afar as they amassed their wealth and power in secret using a variety of dubious and black market methods. \n\nThis scheming came to a head in late 1930, when the Kaiserreich, unaware of the growing local radical tensions, decided to allow the native Maltese to form a civilian government underneath the Knights’ watch. Despite the local Nationalist-Conservative party, the ‘Partit Nazzjonalista’, winning the local elections, their rule was quickly and completely undermined when the New Sons of Malta finally played their hand. Appearing from the shadows like phantoms, they moved unseen, working with blackmail and extortion, bribery and assassination, to completely cripple both the German-Knights coalition government and the newly elected Partit Nazzjonalista cabinet. With this secret society of international elites and mysterious financiers seizing power over Malta, they have managed to rule for nearly six years, duping the German delegation and Berlin the entire time. \n\nHowever, the New Sons are far from secure in their rule, for after funding from their respective favored Italian factions and from the New Sons themselves in a bid to destabilize the German Garrison, the Democratic parties and Socialist cells within Malta have gained great power. Worse yet for them, the radical wing of the Knights have started to grow once again in popularity and Germany has begun to catch on to the New Sons’ plot, despite sedition acts passed by their puppeted facade government sending panic and disorganization through the archipelago. With these tensions rising, and the Republicans increasingly more vocal in their desire for new elections and an end to the clearly fake government’s charade, it would seem that time is ticking for the New Sons, and Malta shall soon be free to choose its destiny once again."

mlt.9.t:0 "The True Knights of Malta"
mlt.9.d:0 "Serving as the liaison between Germany and Malta before the rise of the New Sons, and as our main facade now, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, or the SMOM, is currently led by 76th Grand Master Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere-Albani. Devoutly Catholic, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and ever chivalrous and stalwart, this knightly military order has faded into and out of prominence for centuries, but once again finds itself thrust into national prominence as the New Sons and their coalition collapse. Viewed by some as traitors due to their ties with the Kaiserreich, the SMOM is fiercely dedicated to Maltese nationalism and the preservation of our archipelago, declaring adamantly that their cooperation with Germany is purely seen as a necessity to preserve Maltese culture and the survival of our people. Preaching for a pious and stable Malta tied to the German Empire, the front-face of the Order hides a more independent, illustrious, and possibly deluded secret faction that holds far greater aspirations for the archipelago tied to former and long-dead glories. Regardless of their obsession with the past and that they possibly harbor far more dangerous zealots and radicals within their ranks, the Order is wholly devoted to protecting Malta in perpetuity, no matter the cost. Once the German Garrison is forced from the island in accordance with the Great Plan, the SMOM will once again play their party to ensure Maltese independence, for they are planned to become the main military of the nation, and regardless of their political aspirations, there they shall serve admirably in the defence of the nation, though we will have to keep tabs their deep ties to the Partit Nazzjonalista. No matter the outcome of the Grand Plan, the Maltese people can always rely on these knights in shining armor to save them."
mlt.9.a:0 "Tuitio fidei et obsequium pauperum!"

mlt.10.t:0 "The Republican Element"
mlt.10.d:0 "Currently forced to languish as a powerless facade under the regime of the New Sons to save face with the German Empire, the republican ‘government’ of Malta is largely non-existent, with most republicans in the nation forced into being little more than a resistance movement - one that perfectly fits into the Grand Plan. Coalescing under a provisional government until the first elections can be organized and held - if and only when our gamble pays off, the current democratic scene is mainly divided into three camps: Partit Nazzjonalista, Partit Kostituzzjonali, and Partit Laburista. \n\nThe Partit Nazzjonalista is a right-wing, conservative, and nationalist party that has rallied around Enrico Mizzi and is further divided into three subfactions all vying for influence: the Ċentristi who are mainly moderates split between either preferring cooperation with Italy or maintaining full independence, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta who seek to bring measured military rule Malta while maintaining ties to the Kaiserreich, and the Kavallieri Radikali - a secretive factions within the SMOM that seek to reestablish a government similar to the old crusader state system of the Knights. \n\nThe Partit Kostituzzjonali is the main liberal party of Malta, forming the middleground of the democratic process. They have largely rallied around Baron Gerald Strickland, an Anglo who stayed behind after the British Collapse in order to protect the remaining Anglo population left behind and has since risen to become an anti-German champion among the Maltese people. Split between a more capitalistic Konservatiivi faction and a more progressive Liberali faction, the party still largely agrees that cooperation with the Entente is the best way forward for Malta, and has pursued close ties with the Algiers Regime and Canada. \n\nThe least cemented camp is the Partit Laburista, which is currently caught in an internal rift the party hides from the public and its supporters. Paul Boffa leads the base of the party as a champion of European-style Social Democracy and non-Syndicalist labourite policies, but his position has been slowly eroded away by the Radikali led by Dominic Mintoff and Carmelo Borg Pisani. These Radikali have surged to prominence due to a large influx of funding coming from the Socialist Republic of Italy - something our organization has been hard at work trying to circumvent, and have begun to steal supporters from Boffa’s labourites in an attempt to quietly seize the party. \n\nTogether, these varied groups make up the republican elements of Malta, and with these desperate democrats in our hands, the Grand Plan is sure to succeed."
mlt.10.a:0 "Virtute et constantia!"

mlt.11.t:0 "The Socialist Vermin of Malta"
mlt.11.d:0 "For many years, the Partit Laburista has harbored a tumor. Slowly growing and metastasizing throughout the party, the cancer of radical Socialism has infected Paul Boffa’s beloved hub of social democracy. Fueled, supplied, radicalized, and influenced by the Third Internationale - and primarily Italy, these Socialist cells have begun to take over the Partit Laburista, slowly pushing Boffa out of his own party while the rest of the nation is none the wiser. Led by Dominic Mintoff, an avowed Christian Syndicalist taking inspiration from Italy’s Alceste De Ambris and Giacomo Matteoti, and Carmelo Borg Pisani, a Maltese nationalist who greatly admires the Renaissance and emulates Bennito Mussolini’s Totalism while also pulling from Italo Balbo’s ideas, these ‘Radikali’ seek to infiltrate our democracy and tear it down from within. Though much of the nation remains unaware of these rats and their vile plot, Paul Boffa and his labourites currently are engaged in political war for the soul of the Partit Laburista and possibly for the fate of the nation. Despite their current goals and feud with the Labourites, these Socialists still have a part to play in the Grand Plan, and with our guidance and additional financial assistance, they too shall help our gamble pay off."

mlt.12.t:0 "Malta Declares Independence!"
mlt.12.d:0 "With the fallout from Black Monday continuing to wreak havoc upon both our economy and the wider empire at large, our great and mighty Kaiserreich has begun to falter; our tendrils of influence that once spread across the globe now wither and die as local groups use this time of weakness to enact their dastardly plans for independence. Across the Kaiserreich, bastions of German influence falter to native unrest and seditious activity, usurping our colonial mandates and military garrisons in the far reaches of our Kaiserreich. \n\nOne such region using this time of instability to their advantage is the New Sons of Malta, who have used their considerable fortunes to rally the local Maltese political factions under a shared banner in a semi-cohesive and barely-cooperating coalition aimed at toppling the German garrison that has held the islands since the fall of the British Empire. Though these ‘New Sons’ have vast amounts of wealth at their disposal, their influence has been vastly drowned out by the swelling tide of Maltese nationalist and nativist sentiments that have consumed the archipelago, and their ‘rule’ over Malta shall soon and assuredly fall to one of the myriad of local political factions that have temporarily set aside their differences to free their islands from our grasp. \n\nDespite being an important naval and air base for the Kaiserreich, Malta serves no larger or necessary purpose within our empire, and with Black Monday still ravaging our economy, we are in little position to stop them. It seems Malta has won its independence, at least for now."
mlt.12.a:0 "Oh no! Anyway..."

mlt.13.t:0 "The Collapse of the New Sons of Malta"
mlt.13.d:0 "Using their vast fortunes and political ties, the varied and anonymous financiers and captains of industry that make up the New Sons of Malta have saved our archipelago from the grasp of the Hun and their greedy Kaiser. By funding and supplying all political groups within the nation, ranging from the Republican elements shackled under the German Garrison to the various nationalist and socialist cells and groups that pervade these islands, the New Sons have propelled the Maltese people to carry themselves to victory. However, this situation has spiralled out of the control of the New Sons, for the very movements they once funded have swelled to be both uncontrollable and no longer beholden to these bored rich men masquerading as a secret order. \n\nShortly after the German flag was torn down over Valletta, so too was the shadow order of the New Sons, with their identities revealed and their surviving members forced to flee the island lest they face retribution. Our Malta, now freed from the grasp of both the Hun and the New Sons, is now free to pursue its own destiny, and with the ever tumultuous political landscape of our small archipelago now free to blast off in a new direction, our newly freed nation and people now stand at a crossroads as the coalition created by the New Sons collapses nearly as quickly as it formed. We must brace ourselves for the future as we move to establish a provisional government in the wake of this new shift until a more permanent direction can be established."
mlt.13.a:0 "For a free and independent Malta!"

mlt.14.t:0 "Malta Secures Independence!"
mlt.14.d:0 "Following the disaster that was Black Monday, the Kaiserreich was beset by numerous uprisings and revolts within nations and territories under their grasp as local populations across the German Empire attempted to stab the Global Hegemon in the back as it lay weak and exposed. Though most of these revolts proved to be fruitless wastes of human life, the same cannot be said for what has occurred in the small archipelago of Malta, which has recently secured their own independence after a local masonic order known as the New Sons of Malta supplied seperatist forces on the island and roused them to establish a temporary coalition and rebel. Now, with their financiers forced to flee the island and with the German flag over Valletta now lowered, the small island nation of Malta stands at a crossroads while the rest of the world rages around them."
mlt.14.a:0 "Who cares about Malta?"

mlt.15.t:0 "A Return to Tradition?" 
mlt.15.d:0 "With our hold over Malta now secure, the time has finally come to square away one of the largest internal problems facing the Order of St. John. While always existing in a form of militaristic nostalgia, but greatly invigorated by the New Sons, a sect of the order has long wished for a return to our crusading origins. While not directly linked to founding of the great Crusader Kingdoms, our order was founded within the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and we are perhaps one of the last vestiges of that long-dead Kingdom to still exist. This fact has lead many within the order, especially those in the younger generation, to yearn for a return to the old order, one in which Catholicism and Catholic Kings and Princes ruled over the Holy Land. Having ties to the Austrian Order of the Golden Fleece and viewing Austria as the one power that may actually support such a rival, this grouping poses little actual threat to the Order of St. John as a whole. Despite this, due to the fact that the order is the undisputed master of Malta, their presence could possibly lead to disunity in the future. Thus, the Grand Master has called an emergency meeting to finally make a ruling on these radical traditionalists , once and for all."
