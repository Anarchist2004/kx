## Ideas ##
MLT_langaune_question:0 "The Language Question"
MLT_langaune_question_desc:0 "One of the most pivotal questions of the current Maltese political scene, the Language Question, concerns the very future of every soul in the nation. With Malta long being the play thing of outside powers, her own culture reflects that. Influences from the British, Italians, and even the Germans can be felt everywhere one looks. While this has created a unique melting pot of cultures, due to the fact that not one these influences is fully in command, it has also caused great strife, further egged on by Germany's decision to remove English and Italian as official languages and add German to the list in 1930, leaving Maltese and German as the sole official languages of our island and inflaming tensions across the archipelago. All major parties within Malta argue for adopting their preferred major language, so that they can finally put this question to rest. With the rise of the New Sons however, this question, like all things has been put on hold, seemingly permanently."

MLT_republicanismonrise:0 "Pangs of Republicanism"
MLT_republicanismonrise_desc:0 "Since 1921, when Germany first gained control over Malta and restored the Sovereign Military Order of Malta to power over the archipelago, the people have lacked a truly democratic way to express themselves. While the 1930 elections did much to calm these calls for a return to democracy, the sudden rise of the New Sons and their paralyzing effect on the nation practically undid all good that came from it. Even with the New Sons in effective power, these calls for democracy carry on, seemingly as a way to parrot that Malta is not under the control of a sole entity."

MLT_commie_cells:0 "Socialist Cells"
MLT_commie_cells_desc:0 "Despite Malta's overwhelming Catholic and conservative population, some socialist cells within the Labour Party, rumored to have strong ties to the near-by Socialist Republic of Italy do exist. While posing little threat even before the New Sons come to be, if and when the New Sons should falter in their control over our fair isles, they could present a significant risk to our security."

MLT_blind_garrison:0 "The Blind Garrison"
MLT_blind_garrison_desc:0 "Present since 1921 and further bolstered in 1924, the Kasierreich's Malta Garrison has been effectively blind to the true ongoings of our state since the rise of the New Sons six years ago. Keeping the Kaiserreich ignorant with disappearances and bribery, the New Sons have duped the German Empire into thinking everything is function normal on our little archipelago, regardless of how actually paralyzed the local garrison is. Despite their blindness, the Garrison is still our only true defense against the outside world, and should Malta ever overstep, it can be assured that the Garrison would intervene, to protect the Kaiser's Mediterranean prize." 
MLT_sons_of_malta_base:0 "The ''New Sons of Malta''"
MLT_sons_of_malta_base_desc:0 "The ‘New’ Sons of Malta are a contemporary facsimile of the original Independent Order of the Sons of Malta, a fraternal organization similar to the Freemasons that was active during 1800s as a mystic secret society with many prominent politicians and world figures being members of its ranks. A far cry from this noble and harmless past, the New Sons are a group of pretenders - rich, powerful, and well connected men working together to pursue their own selfish agenda on a global scale. Using their vast fortunes and influence, these deluded dreamers have seized control of the archipelago of Malta after Germany loosened its grip in 1930. Since then, this shadowy cabal of cowardly businessmen and spoiled aristocrats have masqueraded as ne'er-do-wells and masterminds bent on freeing their home isles from German control by controlling the strings of the Kaiserreich from its dark underbelly. In reality, the New Sons have only managed to gain a small amount of influence within Germany's FAUD and among her investment banking class,  making their "Grand Plan" seemingly a pipe dream. In short, the New Sons may have been able to fool the naive and the poor citizens of Malta these long six years, but it seems they are destined to exposure and failure. Until then however, Malta is locked in their greedy vice, waiting for the moment that their future comes knocking..."

MLT_prep_crusade:0 "Awaken the Crusader Spirit"
MLT_prep_crusade_desc:0 "The Knights of Malta have the luxury of being one of the few orders of Crusaders still in existence. With a proven history of connection to the old Kingdom of Jerusalem, many younger members of the Order long to reclaim the Holy Land.

While their place in the actual liberation of Malta will be small to nonexistence, the post liberation world is a much different matter.

Malta and the new sons of malta have just declared indpence from the reich, and have taken the garrison with them. the new sons larp as the illumatinat and have united literally all maltese factions into one enity for freedom. they infulenced black monday slightly, but were't the cause of it. it's also just a bunch of old dudes with fuck you money so yeah. due to black monday still effecting us, we can't do shit"
malta.1.a:0 "damn bro that's crazy"

malta.2.t:0 "The Collapse of the New Sons of Malta"
malta.2.d:0 "malta is free now but due to the fact that big tent poltiics are fake and gay, and cuz they literally just throw money at people, they ded now. very sad, the knights are now free to act as they see fit for the first time in nearly 7 years"
malta.2.a:0 "Their time has come."

malta.3.t:0 "Maltese Independence(news event)"
malta.3.d:0 "malta is free thanks to free mason larpers. the larpers are also ded now pretty sus bro."
malta.3.a:0 "wow"

mlt.1.t:0 "A Future in Flux"
mlt.1.d:0 "After years of instability and decay gnawed away at their flimsy foundations, the New Sons of Malta have finally been ousted, and with them gone, their facade government had collapsed. Our archipelago now stands at the precipice of its new future, for citizens across Malta could easily wake up to one of two very different realities as the power vacuum rushes to be filled. \n\nThe two main groups currently holding the strength, ties, and support necessary to seize power peacefully with the support of at least a decent percent of the population are the Republicans, rallying around three main democratic parties, and the Knights of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. With the SMOM’s reputation as a German interest group growing, they may experience some pushback, but with the rising Socialist tendencies within some groups inside the Labour party, they may be needed to keep Malta from Socialism. We must tread carefully, for our destiny is dawning, and we best make the right choices now so as to not sully our new found freedom."
mlt.1.a:0 "Begin to organize elections! The Repubblika ta’ Malta shall be reaffirmed!"
mlt.1.b:0 "For stability and piety, the Knights wrest control as the false Sons fall."

mlt.2.t:0 "The Riots of St. Paul’s Bay"
mlt.2.d:0 "With the Sovereign Military Order of Malta’s decision to retain the reins of power in Malta and not give way to democratic practices, the various republican elements around our archipelago began to riot, particularly in the capital of Veletta. However, just a few miles away, a far larger uprising was growing in St. Paul’s Bay, Malta’s largest and most industrialized city. Long a hotspot for Socialist thought, especially among the intelligentsia and the local dockhands and factory workers, St. Paul’s Bay is now engulfed in popular uprising as the local Socialist cells, riled up and antagonized to action by the Knights and by their new allies in Socialist Italy. This uprising, bringing with it a mass general strike, has crippled Malta’s fledgling economy, and the Knights must act soon if they have any hope at stopping the Red Menace. With their weapons at the ready, the Knights dived into the heart of the city to try to save it from this foreign-backed crimson tide."
mlt.2.a:0 "The Knights are crushed by SRI marines, and the Red Star rises over Malta."
mlt.2.b:0 "The Socialists are routed before their SRI allies can save them."

mlt.3.t:0 "Labour Party Internal ‘Elections’"
mlt.3.d:0 "With the first free elections since 1917 nearing on the horizon, the Partit Laburista has called for an internal leadership election to decide the new face and direction of the party. With Paul Boffa’s reputation preceding him, much of the main body of the Labourists joined in with his camp without second thought. However, the rising radical faction led avowed Socialist Dominic Mintoff has seen skyrocketing support, and now poses a serious threat to Boffa’s long standing dominance. More concerningly, these ‘Radikali’ have been reported to not even be true Labourists at all, instead being infiltrators from the various Socialist and Syndicalist cells that stalk Malta, though these reports have been from our contacts in the SMOM and it is not known if we can truly trust them. Driven on in secret through funding from Socialists in Italy, these Radicals have long duped their partymates, and now may even have the power to seize the Labour nomination. With the final tally of the internal elections being counted, it is only a matter of time before the decision is made and the party’s fate is sealed. Let us hope the warnings from the Knights did not go unheeded."
mlt.3.a:0 "The Radikali under Mintoff wrests control of the party in secret."
mlt.3.b:0 "Party Leader Boffa holds on and disperses the Radikali."

mlt.4.t:0 "Nationalist Party Internal Elections"
mlt.4.d:0 "As the landmark elections near ever closer, the Partit Nazzjonalista have announced that they will be holding an internal election of their own to determine the future direction of the party. Unlike in the Labour Party, the main man in the PN is Enrico Mizzi without question, for only he has the respect and influence to get the disparate groups within the modern PN to cooperate. What these internal elections shall instead decide is who shall come to form the bulk of Mizzi’s cabinet should he be elected. Within the NP lies three major factions who stand a shot at earning Mizzi’s favour. The Ċentristi are the mainstay of the NP party, and form the bulk of its base. Priding themselves on Catholic conservatism and tradition, they are supported by much of the traditional and rural population, as well as being supported through foreign channels by the Italian Federation and the Pope. Their main opponent are the Knights themselves, whose Sovereign Military Order of Malta has long been the lords of our archipelago, but have lost respect over the years due to their bending to Germany and their ineffectiveness in stopping the New Sons of Malta. The darkshorse candidates are from the ‘Kavallieri Radikali’ - a group of radical and extremist Knights from the Order that long for past glories, holding their love in the Lord above all. These three varied groups must court Mizzi and his allies if they wish to have a shot at ruling our islands."
mlt.4.a:0 "The moderate Ċentristi win out."
mlt.4.b:0 "The Sovereign Military Order’s moderates maintain their mandate."
mlt.4.c:0 "The darkhorse Kavallieri Radikali seizes control of the NP."

mlt.5.t:0 "Constitutionalist Party Internal Elections"
mlt.5.d:0 "Finally, following suit with the other democratic parties, the Partit Kostituzzjonali have announced their intention to hold internal elections. Like the PN, the PK has one main figure at its head capable of unifying its disparate factions - Baron Gerald Strickland. Remaining here after the fall of the British Empire to protect the remaining Anglos unable to flee the island as London fell to the reds and as German marines arrived on Malta, the 1st Baron Strickland is a capable, if aging, leader that has long kept the remaining British souls left in this archipelago from splitting apart. Within the PK lies two major wings - the Konservatiivi and the Liberali - both vying to form the majority of Strickland’s cabinet. Both seeking returned ties to the Entente and the British Crown, the groups mainly differ in their economic and social policies, with the Liberali being more progressive and populist while the Konservatiivi are far more concerned with the free proliferation of capitalism, though both are still rather conservatrve by any moderate metric. Whichever side wins out shall join Stickland to represent the few Anglos left on this tiny archipelago for their chance at returning home."
mlt.5.a:0 "The capitalistic Konservatiivi win the day."
mlt.5.b:0 "The progressive Liberali earn the ticket."

mlt.6.t:0 "The Maltese Elections of [GetYear]"
mlt.6.d:0 "The New Sons of Malta are well and truly dead, and the three main democratic parties here in our beautiful archipelago have each solidified around a unified position of their own. The stage is set, and the candidates and our citizens are ready for true democracy to return to our island paradise. Though we still exist in a state of relative chaos and disarray, we hope that this election shall mark the first step on our road to recovery. With the final votes being counted now, it is only a matter of time before the Repubblika ta’ Malta shall be fully reborn!"
mlt.6.a:0 "Partit Nazzjonalista secures victory, leaving the conservative majority relieved."
mlt.6.b:0 "Partit Laburista is triumphant, and the workers of Malta cheer for it."
mlt.6.c:0 "Partit Kostituzzjonali wins, marking a possible turning point for the Maltese Anglos."

mlt.7.t:0 "The Knights Make Their Move"
mlt.7.d:0 "With the shocking victory of Dom Mintoff and his Socialist Radikali who have long been infiltrating the Partit Laburista with support from the Italian Socialist Republic, the Knights of the SMOM have sprang to action to try to defend their bastion of tradition. Launching raids against the Socialist stronghold of St. Paul’s Bay, the Sovereign Order hopes to dislodge this vile threat before the SRI’s marines can land to relieve the militias and small Socialist cells. As Grand Master Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere gave the order however, reports came in that the Socialists under Mintoff and his extremist ally Carmelo Borg Pisani had invaded and fully seized the islands of Gozo and Comino, isolating the Knights to just the main island of Malta proper save for the small islands of Filfla, Cominotto, and in St. Paul’s Bay inlet, where the Knight’s standing fortresses have kept the Socialist at bay. The island is in a state of all out war, and it is only a matter of time before the dust will settle and one group stands alone."
mlt.7.a:0 "Tuitio Fidei et Obsequium Pauperum! The Knights of Malta rise again!"
mlt.7.b:0 "The Red Star of Socialism shall rise over our archipelago!"


mlt.8.t:0 "The Small, Shining Jewel of the Mediterranean"
mlt.8.d:0 "The small but stalwart archipelago of Malta has a long and storied history of constantly falling under the sway of different foreign powers. Whether it be the Sicilian Arabs of the long-gone Emirate or the French and British who both had their time as lords over this paradise within the Mediterranean, the islands rarely have been allowed to live their own way, and when they have, it was usually under the watch of the historic and heroic Knights of Malta. \n\nHowever, the Knights have fallen far from grace, and now largely exist as pro-German sycophants - a husk of their past power save for the few circles of radicals that still cling to the old ways. Led by the 76th Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere-Albani, the SMOM re-surged to national prominence as the heralds of the new German occupation following the fall of the British Empire. Allied and heavily backed by the Kaiserreich and its new Maltese Garrison, the Knights ruled as a soft military government while Germany mainly used the islands as an airstrip. This military government largely held on unopposed on the surface, but across the underground of Malta, Republican protests and Socialist agents worked to undermine their rule at every turn. Meanwhile, the infamous and perfidious New Sons of Malta worked from deeper in the shadows, pulling the strings from afar as they amassed their wealth and power in secret using a variety of dubious and black market methods. \n\nThis scheming came to a head in late 1930, when the Kaiserreich, unaware of the growing local radical tensions, decided to allow the native Maltese to form a civilian government underneath the Knights’ watch. Despite the local Nationalist-Conservative party, the ‘Partit Nazzjonalista’, winning the local elections, their rule was quickly and completely undermined when the New Sons of Malta finally played their hand. Appearing from the shadows like phantoms, they moved unseen, working with blackmail and extortion, bribery and assassination, to completely cripple both the German-Knights coalition government and the newly elected Partit Nazzjonalista cabinet. With this secret society of international elites and mysterious financiers seizing power over Malta, they have managed to rule for nearly six years, duping the German delegation and Berlin the entire time. \n\nHowever, the New Sons are far from secure in their rule, for after funding from their respective favored Italian factions and from the New Sons themselves in a bid to destabilize the German Garrison, the Democratic parties and Socialist cells within Malta have gained great power. Worse yet for them, the radical wing of the Knights have started to grow once again in popularity and Germany has begun to catch on to the New Sons’ plot, despite sedition acts passed by their puppeted facade government sending panic and disorganization through the archipelago. With these tensions rising, and the Republicans increasingly more vocal in their desire for new elections and an end to the clearly fake government’s charade, it would seem that time is ticking for the New Sons, and Malta shall soon be free to choose its destiny once again."
