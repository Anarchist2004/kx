## Ideas ##
MLT_langaune_question:0 "The Language Question"
MLT_langaune_question_desc:0 "One of the most pivotal questions of the current Maltese political scene, the Language Question, concerns the very future of every soul in the nation. With Malta long being the play thing of outside powers, her own culture reflects that. Influences from the British, Italians, and even the Germans can be felt everywhere one looks. While this has created a unique melting pot of cultures, due to the fact that not one these influences is fully in command, it has also caused great strife, further egged on by Germany's decision to remove English and Italian as official languages and add German to the list in 1930, leaving Maltese and German as the sole official languages of our island and inflaming tensions across the archipelago. All major parties within Malta argue for adopting their preferred major language, so that they can finally put this question to rest. With the rise of the New Sons however, this question, like all things has been put on hold, seemingly permanently."

MLT_republicanismonrise:0 "Pangs of Republicanism"
MLT_republicanismonrise_desc:0 "Since 1921, when Germany first gained control over Malta and restored the Sovereign Military Order of Malta to power over the archipelago, the people have lacked a truly democratic way to express themselves. While the 1930 elections did much to calm these calls for a return to democracy, the sudden rise of the New Sons and their paralyzing effect on the nation practically undid all good that came from it. Even with the New Sons in effective power, these calls for democracy carry on, seemingly as a way to parrot that Malta is not under the control of a sole entity."

MLT_commie_cells:0 "Socialist Cells"
MLT_commie_cells_desc:0 "Despite Malta's overwhelming Catholic and conservative population, some socialist cells within the Labour Party, rumored to have strong ties to the near-by Socialist Republic of Italy do exist. While posing little threat even before the New Sons come to be, if and when the New Sons should falter in their control over our fair isles, they could present a significant risk to our security."

MLT_blind_garrison:0 "The Blind Garrison"
MLT_blind_garrison_desc:0 "Present since 1921 and further bolstered in 1924, the Kasierreich's Malta Garrison has been effectively blind to the true ongoings of our state since the rise of the New Sons six years ago. Keeping the Kaiserreich ignorant with disappearances and bribery, the New Sons have duped the German Empire into thinking everything is function normal on our little archipelago, regardless of how actually paralyzed the local garrison is. Despite their blindness, the Garrison is still our only true defense against the outside world, and should Malta ever overstep, it can be assured that the Garrison would intervene, to protect the Kaiser's Mediterranean prize." 
MLT_sons_of_malta_base:0 "The ''New Sons of Malta''"
MLT_sons_of_malta_base_desc:0 "The ‘New’ Sons of Malta are a contemporary facsimile of the original Independent Order of the Sons of Malta, a fraternal organization similar to the Freemasons that was active during 1800s as a mystic secret society with many prominent politicians and world figures being members of its ranks. A far cry from this noble and harmless past, the New Sons are a group of pretenders - rich, powerful, and well connected men working together to pursue their own selfish agenda on a global scale. Using their vast fortunes and influence, these deluded dreamers have seized control of the archipelago of Malta after Germany loosened its grip in 1930. Since then, this shadowy cabal of cowardly businessmen and spoiled aristocrats have masqueraded as ne'er-do-wells and masterminds bent on freeing their home isles from German control by controlling the strings of the Kaiserreich from its dark underbelly. In reality, the New Sons have only managed to gain a small amount of influence within Germany's FAUD and among her investment banking class,  making their "Grand Plan" seemingly a pipe dream. In short, the New Sons may have been able to fool the naive and the poor citizens of Malta these long six years, but it seems they are destined to exposure and failure. Until then however, Malta is locked in their greedy vice, waiting for the moment that their future comes knocking..."

MLT_to_bring_down_an_empire:0 "To Bring Down an Empire"
MLT_to_bring_down_an_empire_desc:0 "The yoke of the Hohenzollern cancer has spread to our once proud islands and now holds us as a playpen for “protection from the syndicalists” when we are little more than another possession of them. But the Maltese spirit is not destined to be chained down. Our order plants the seeds of devastation that will open up the chance for our freedom."
MLT_wild_cat_strikes:0 "Spark Wildcat Strikes!"
MLT_wild_cat_strikes_desc:0 "For the past several years since the end of the Weltkerig, if not even before, the economy of the Kaiserreich has been failing. Be it a stagnant world economy, the crashing of Wall Street, or even just the Reich's own overgrowth, her economy is headed for a recession. While such a thing will obviously come sooner or later, by using our influence within the FAUD to trigger wildcat strikes around Germany, we could push the final domino down, and finally be able to enact our Grand Plan to free our isles!"
MLT_invester_pullout:0 "Spark Panic Pullouts!"
MLT_invester_pullout_desc:0 "For the past several years since the end of the Weltkerig, if not even before, the economy of the Kaiserreich has been failing. Be it a stagnant world economy, the crashing of Wall Street, or even just the Reich's own overgrowth, her economy is headed for a recession. While such a thing will obviously come sooner or later, by using our influence with the many investors within Germany, we could spark a round of panic pullouts and buyouts, possibly pushing the final domino down, and allowing us to finally be able to enact our Grand Plan to free our isles!"
MLT_our_chance:0 "A Chance for Freedom"
MLT_our_chance_desc:0 "Success! The German economy is in shambles, and her empire is at last vulnerable after years of waiting. Regardless if it was our intervention that caused Black Monday, our chance is finally here, and we cannot waste it!"
MLT_the_socialists:0 "Readying the Socialists"
MLT_the_socialists_desc:0 "The Socialists of Malta are far and few between, mostly hidden within the depths of the Labour Party. Regardless of this fact, they still make up part of Malta, and thus part of the Grand Plan. To ensure the Grand Plan's success, we must get the Socialists ready to go on strike, to cripple the Garrison's ability to repair and restock"
MLT_ready_the_revolution:0 "The Revolution on Standby"
MLT_ready_the_revolution_desc:0 "For the Grand Plan to work, the Socialists and their working class contacts must be on constant alert, ready to answer the call to action at any time of day. The Revolution simply must be on standby if we are to have any chance for victory."
MLT_the_knights:0 "Preparing the Knights"
MLT_the_knights_desc:0 "The Knights of Malta have long been the de-facto rulers of Malta since she fell under the Kaiser's boot following the British Revolution. While their numbers are small, and they are not what they used to be, the Knights still hold much valor. While their part in the Grand Plan is small, it is vital, and thus they must be prepared."
MLT_prep_crusade:0 "Awaken the Crusader Spirit"
MLT_prep_crusade_desc:0 "The Knights of Malta have the luxury of being one of the few orders of Crusaders still in existence. With a proven history of connection to the old Kingdom of Jerusalem, many younger members of the Order long to reclaim the Holy Land. By awaking this spirit, by painting the Germanic heretics as simply the first step in restoring Outremer, we can prepare them for the part they shall play in the Grand Plan."
MLT_the_republicans:0 "Frenzy the Republicans"
MLT_the_republicans_desc:0 "The various political parties of Malta, be it the Nazzjonalista or the Kostituzzjonali, are the most important peice of the Grand Plan. While their place in the actual liberation of Malta will be small to nonexistence, the post liberation world is a much different matter. They shall form the basis of our new civilzation, giving the people a true voice with the halls of power, thus they must be frenzied, and ready to act as soon as the time is ripe."

MLT_democratic_mandate:0 "A Democratic Mandate"
MLT_democratic_mandate_desc:0 "For the second time in Maltese history, truly democratic elections have finally taken place. No longer is the government of Malta something imposed by a foreign power, or enforced by a shadow organization. The people of Malta have finally spoken, and their voices have at last finally be heard. Never again will the people of Malta be governed by anyone but themselves."
MLT_nat:0 "A Nationalist Victory"
MLT_nat_desc:0 "Having been elected in a landslide majority in the elections of 1930, it comes as little shock that the Partit Nazzjonalista secured victory in Malta's second elections. Riding to power on a platform that wishes to codify the existing status quo, the Nazzjonalista strive to protect the Church's place in society and promote closer ties with Italy. The Party also pushes for a hardline against the dwindling British and German presence in Malta, as there is only one true motherland for the Maltese people, Italy. "
MLT_ensure_churches_place:0 "Safeguard Holy Mother Church"
MLT_ensure_churches_place_desc:0 "The Church and the Maltese State have always existed as intertwined entities. The Church commands and the State listens. While this state of affairs was once common throughout Eurupe, since the dawn of the enlightenment, it is becoming less and less the case. In this modern age, only Malta, Italy and perhaps Austria can brag about maintaining the basis of Christendom. To ensure that this Holy and Blessed state of affairs never wavers, the Partit Nazzjonalista has moved to enshrine the Church's place in a newly drafted Maltese constitution. Even despite the wishes of an increasingly secular world, never again shall Mother Church's place be threatened! "
MLT_anti_angloid:0 "Rabid Anti-Anglophilia"
MLT_anti_angloid_desc:0 "The Partit Nazzjonalista is the heir to one of Malta's first political parties, the Anti-Reform Party, which was founded as a way to combat England's attempts to remove Italian and the Church from Malta. Due to this, Anglophobia is within the Party's very DNA. As such, the Party has moved to do away with many of the remaining institutions and laws that were created during England's reign. On top of this, schools shall teach the youth the truth of those Imperialist war dogs that once threatened our great island. By doing this, we can ensure that never again will the Anglo rule Malta."
MLT_what_do_knights:0 "The Final Fate of Malta's Stoic Guardians"
MLT_what_do_knights_desc:0 "For nearly two hundred years, the Knights of Malta had ruled over our fair isle, until their eviction by the Emperor of the French in 1798. Since then, the Order of Saint John had existed in a strange limbo, technically being a sovereign entity, but not controlling any territory. This would come to an end following the Weltkrieg, where Germany would formally reinstate the Knights as the lords of Malta, both as a way to keep the population happy by having Catholic leadership and to be able to keep a strong hand . With the fall of the New Sons and with elections creating a popular government, the Knights, once again, have entered into a state of limbo. While technically still ruling over Malta, since the elections, the government of [root.getleader] has ruled every aspect of the island. With this being the case, the time has come for the Partit Nazzjonalista to decide just what to do with Malta's protectors."
MLT_a_pious_and_maltese_malta:0 "A Malta Worthy of Saint Paul's Legacy"
MLT_a_pious_and_maltese_malta_desc:0 "Saint Paul himself is the man who brought the faith of Christ to these fair shores. In almost every aspect of our culture, St. Paul is honored in some way. In recent years however, be it due to perfidious Albion, the New Sons or even the Knights themselves, Malta has been unworthy to even whisper St. Paul's name. With the rise of the Partit Nazzjonalista however, this has changed. Malta is no longer stagnant, under the thumb of a great power. Finally, Malta is a free nation, under God. At long last, we are truly worth to be Saint Paul's proudest children."
MLT_nationalistic_democracy:0 "A Uniquely Maltese Democracy"
MLT_nationalistic_democracy_desc:0 "Despite some calls within the Party to do away with democracy wholesale, this cannot be. While we may take a hard stance against liberalism, democracy is still perhaps the best way for us to maintain a popular mandate. Due to this, we shall maintain the democratic process. However, this does not mean that Maltese democracy will be a pure one. Far from it in fact, as if there is one thing that allows the demonic to enter government, it is unfettered access to the ballot box. To ensure that our democratic process does not fall into the Devil's traps, we shall implement various safeguards. While other parties will be able to still come to power, they shall do so under vicarious observation, staffed by clergy of Holy Mother Church. Maltese democracy shall be like no other on Earth, as ours shall be protected by God Himself. "
MLT_march_on_valletta:0 "The March on Valletta"
MLT_march_on_valletta_desc:0 "While coming to power on the back of the democratic process, it is becoming increasingly clear that since coming to power, factionalism and divide within the party has grown a thousandfold. While the causes for this factionalism are practically endless, under the leadership of [root.getleader], it is clear that the largest cause is democracy itself. For if one could lose their power by not constantly making promises, by changing the platform to appeal to the masses, factionalism becomes evident. Due to this, [root.getleader] has declared that democracy can no longer stand. Deciding that the easiest way to end democracy is by way of self-coup, the Tal-Ġakketta Blu has been ordered to march into Valletta and arrest oppositional leadership and dissolve their parties. By the end of the day, the Maltese state shall be the Partit Nazzjonalista, and the Partit Nazzjonalista shall be the state"
MLT_normie_nat:0 "Tradition Secured by the Orthodox Nazzjonalista"
MLT_normie_nat_desc:0 "Following a closely fought battle during the primaries following the elections, the orthodox and old guard faction of the Nationalist Party was elected to lead the party into the future.

With the youth wing in power, the government has moved to make the Tal-Ġakketta Blu an official arm of the state. By granting these already ex-policemen power to enforce the law once again, we can ensure the people of Malta truly live up to the example the Party wishes them to.

Due to this, the Party under the Youth Wing has entered a period of mass disunity, over which ideology is fit for Malta.

While we shall not go as far to declare a secular state, for that would be a bridge too far at this point, we shall begin building walls between Church and State.

For our dream to truly succeed, all power must be vested in his sure and steady hands, so all supreme power and final say in the government - executive, legislative, and judicial - shall be entrusted to his post, for the Reise shall steer us through thick and thin until we create the Totalist paradise we all dream of."

With the Church burning to ash behind us and with the Revolution secured with the aid of the Crimson Corsairs, the masses must now be whipped up into a nationalistic frenzy so that their unbridled fervor and fanaticism can be channeled into action. On the backs of the proletarian masses, we shall achieve our national ambitions and final destinies, so let us ensure that each and every one of them is on our side first, indoctrinated or eliminated until an entire society united as one and dedicated to the sole task of preserving the Revolution is all that is left."

Though we shall not bend our will to any false Arab faith, we shall embrace the golden age that existed when their kind once ruled over our archipelago, shifting Malta’s culture, architecture, art, and way of life towards a more tolerant and utopian way of life supported by the piracy actions of our new Crimson Corsairs and by the National Syndicalist ideology of Pisani."

Empowering the growing clique of Neo-Qarmatians within his National Syndicalist coalition and using their influence to replace the Futurists in power among us, we shall shift our focus from the future to the past in order to breed the perfect Maltese society.

Utilizing adapted and fused concepts first dreamed up by Benito Mussolini and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Carmelo Borg Pisani will create a new Rome here in Malta, dragging our storied past - and Rome’s customs, art, and wider society along with it - into the speeding future in a modernized, bastardized socioeconomic, cultural, and political fusion of Classicalism and Futurism none could have expected and all will surely praise."

Due to this, the Grandmaster has issued a decree, formally banning any political party opposed to our rule and barring from office anyone who held membership in these organizations.

Due to this, and due to the meddling of the New Sons, the future of the Order of St. John is up in the air. A faction of the Order, having existed in some form since our foundation in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, that wishes to see the reclamation of the Holy Land from the hold of the Mohammedans, has been greatly invigorated in recent days. With this faction calling for us to sail for Jerusalem growing only louder, and with much of the Order's leadership unsure how to react to the departure of the Reich from Malta, Grandmaster Ludovico has called for a general assembly.

While the history of the Icon itself is long and storied, it eventually ended up in the hands of the Russian Tsars. Following the various Russian revolutions, the Icon, along with a relic of the True Cross and the hand of St. John the Baptist was returned by the Kerensky government to the Knights of Malta, as an act of goodwill between our two nations. While the Icon and other relics have remained venerated and protected since their return, a new sense of reverence has fallen over the Order regarding these relics. With the Order reconnecting to it's Crusader roots, the Knights have begun to honor their patroness with a new found vigor. To encourage this, the Grandmaster has ordered that replicas of the ancient Icon are to be hung in every church that falls under the Knights' protection. By this act, we can honor Our Lady, and perhaps in return, she will honor us before her son."

From these humble origins, the Order would grow, eventually being militarized by our second Grandmaster, Raymond du Puy. Even though it has been almost a thousand years, and though the Order has many more functions then simply running hospitals, we have never forgotten our origins, nor our founder. Thus, in a way to honor our saintly founder and fulfill his mission while also preparing to reclaim Jerusalem, the Grandmaster has authorized the creation of an extensive welfare system throughout our held lands. Be it providing medical care free of charge or providing food or shelter to the hungry and homeless, the Order of St. John shall provide these services.

One such solution lies less than 200 miles to our north, the island of Sicily, which lacks neither population nor farms. Sicily itself, a place where the Faith and Tradition still reigns, has been under the control of Socialists for the better part of the last twenty years. The Sicilians clamor for freedom from the Atheistic and Industrial minded socialists, who care not for the people of their largest island. Who better to aid in their quest for freedom then the Knights of Malta? By linking up with key resistance leaders, and by working with local leadership such as the Mafia, we could take the island without firing a shot.

We have taken a backwards archipelago and transformed it into a model Catholic nation.

While it is still perhaps the largest sore spot between Catholics and the Orthodox, for a short time, it led to the creation of a Catholic Empire in Greece, which lead to the spreading of Catholicism in those ancient lands. With the Greek government having rejected God and His divinely ordained government, perhaps the time has come to restore the Latin Empire. While we do not mean to subject the Greeks to an unjust government, they already toil and suffer under one that rejects God, thus we have the reason we need to recreate one of the many lost Empires of Christendom. Beyond this, Greece shares a direct border with the Turks, whom shall be our enemy number one when the Crusade begins, and having Greece in our pocket could be of great use in cutting the Turks down to size."

However, many of these so-called Catholics, hold dangerous heresies in their hearts.

With the clock ticking for our glorious Crusade against the perfidious Turks, the leadership of the Order have determined that a probing strike, launched against Rhodes, should be undertaken.

Be it the various Spanish Orders, the famed yet dissolved Knights Templar or groups like the Teutonic Order, we shall work to build up these Orders to what they once were.

Taking from this legacy, the Grandmaster and the leaders of other Orders we have already won over, shall begin a similar speaking campaign, aiming to get as many people to join our Crusade as possible. To make this even easier, a new Order, the Military Order of Blessed Urban II shall be created.

Under the direct supervision of His Holiness, the Order representatives the cream of the crop when it comes to the Orders. In an effort to win over the Order, great reformations of the State are to take place. Malta, already a Catholic state, shall become inseparable from the Church.

By having most major legal work done in the German language, it comes as no shock that German also was added on top of the melting pot of languages that call Malta home. With Malta returning to the fold of Germany, making German the official language is simply a logical conclusion for the direction our state has been taken. "

With the ascension of the radical wing of the Knights of Malta, this will no longer remain the case.

While borders and administrations have changed in the 300 years since then, the current Maltese state is the direct heir of the Knights. Thus, as we begin looking into the world, why not attempt to reclaim what was once ours? To do this, we shall simply offer a fair price for these islands. After All, it's not like the various global empires that control them will miss them right?

Regardless of the reason for the unrest, the Leewards are also a hotbed for this activity, thus our government has declared that in an effort to aid the Federation, we could buy the islands off them.

By focusing on the commons between our culture, such as aquacultural based economies or a shared faith in Christ, we may just be able to eke out an Identity for all Mediterraneans to hold.

Thus, bridges across islands, sea tunnels and a government run ferry service shall be created. Only by this action can we hope to fully integrate these lands.

With the Church now once again at the top of the Holy Land, many are wondering if the time has come to do away with this antiquated notion. The Catholic Church is the sole Church of Christ no? So why should we go along with the opinions of schismatics and heretics?

The need for adequate personnel becomes paramount. To ensure Malta's defense and stability, it is crucial to maximize available manpower. As a result, general conscription notices will be prepared and issued in phases. While conscription will lead to some resentment within our general population, a nation's strength and resilience depend on its manpower. With growing tensions far away on distant shores, it is necessary to move away from our dependence on volunteers to ensure Malta's defense readiness. We can also utilize conscripts for various projects such as Malta's construction and industry sectors. These sectors will need significant assistance and monumental effort to be ready for future endeavors, including war if it ever comes to our doorstep."
MLT_begin_navy_reforms:0 "Towards a Truly Maltese Navy"
MLT_begin_navy_reforms_desc:0 "With one of the grandest armadas assembled since antiquity, the Ottoman Turks descended upon Malta in droves during the memorable and frightful Great Siege of Malta in 1565. Their fleet consisted of nearly 200 vessels, hosting 40,000 marauders who intended to wipe Malta off the face of the earth. Before European relief arrived and forced the Ottoman Turks into a shattered retreat, Malta held for four months with 6,000 brave souls. In order to ensure that such an initiative is once again championed by any foe that may make such a similar mistake in invading Malta, another line of defense will need to be established. An independent Maltese navy will form the basis of this line of defense. This will ensure that no enemy combatant steps foot on our shores. However, whatever limited shipbuilding facilities or dockyards within the Grand Harbor that we possess are inherited from British efforts prior to the Weltkrieg. It is with these facilities that we will lay the groundwork for the establishment of the Maltese navy, with the arming of fishing trawlers."

MLT_modernization_of_da_guns_desc:0 "Since our reform efforts, Maltese garrisons have faced critical weaponry issues. This is largely due to Malta's armories not being well maintained for decades. Furthermore, the German garrisons did not leave anything useful behind, leaving behind equipment dating back to the Weltkrieg. This has led to a majority of the equipment being unusable and unreliable. To make matters worse, the garrisons have had difficulty procuring new equipment and supplies due to the limited budget of the Maltese military. The garrison is, however, updated to match contemporary standards by obtaining weapons from other nations. We can at least replace outdated weaponry with unused stockpiles from other nations soon enough. This will allow the Maltese garrison to have an up-to-date arsenal and stand a better chance of fighting anyone who dares to invade Malta."

The priority is established - Malta and its isles are the only redoubts worthy of withstanding a siege for. No Kaiser nor Chairman is worth a thousand of Malta's sons. In preparation for plausible amphibious landings against Malta, bunkers will be built on the shores and doctrines will be prepared and intensely drilled. Coastal patrols will occur daily and both anti-aircraft artillery and coastal battery emplacements will be constructed. With its garrison ready to deal with any attempt to breach Malta, the island will be an impregnable fortress of the Mediterranean."

However, Malta's sons are not expendable by any means, and as such, we will need to ensure that any operation we undertake is strategic and precise. We must also be aware of our limitations and act accordingly, understanding that our soldiers' lives are of the utmost importance. Our officer corps has already begun learning amphibious war doctrines to avoid bloody waters on foreign shores during any beach assault. In addition, they will have the proper equipment needed to minimize casualties and succeed in their mission. Amphibious warfare is not the only means we can use to gain a upper hand on our enemy, but also vertical envelopment - death from above. Jumping out of an airplane is one of the safest things a man can do, provided he follows proper procedure. The Air Wing has already started several experiments concerning deployment from aircraft, seeing large success with an initial batch of volunteers. With these developments, we can create a force that can do an infinite deal of mischief against our enemies before they even have a chance of repelling us."

With a second Great War clearing approaching, it is time we capitalize on our engineering spirit. The government has greenlit the creation of a new Maltese Corp of Engineers.

While most of the research was taken when both sides left Malta, enough has been left that the Corp of Engineers believes that we could reverse Engineer the technology.

However, the existence of these mighty fortresses has led the Corp of Engineers to start their latest project. Dubbed the Castrum Malta Project, the plan envisions a Malta completely and utterly prepared for an attempt at invasion. By building new coastal bunkers, checkpoints in cities and even reporting a few old fortresses, the Corp seeks to create an unbreakable Malta, and even should an invading force land, we shall fight them tooth and nail, going from city to city, island to island, until either they are repelled, or Malta has drained them of the will to fight on."

While the Germans attempted to maintain it, the Dockyard quickly fell behind in technology. Not wishing to invest the vast funds to modernize it, the Germans simply left it in the hands of the Knights of Malta. Lacking funds and being practically frozen in the hands of the New Sons, the Dockyard fell into disrepair. With the New Sons gone, and with us needing a proper base for our own navy, the government has decided to bit the bullet.

Through these reforms, we've effectively done so as the military is ready to take on any obstacle that may present itself. However, we're living in a world that's blowing itself to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it. We will again need to defend our stronghold. We are confident that our legacy and Military Prowess will be an invaluable asset in the fight.

MLT_build_up_eco_desc:0 "While Malta's economy isn't as large as its European counterparts, it remains stable - but stagnant. The past century witnessed Malta's economy flourish and prosper due to the Napoleonic Wars as it became a major trading hub within the Mediterranean. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 also greatly benefitted Malta with the Mediterranean becoming the "world highway of trade", not to mention that we were already a base of operations for the British Mediterranean Fleet and a coaling station for vessels sailing from beyond the Canal. However, at the dawn of the 20th century, Malta found its former prosperity declining worryingly as ships switched from coal to oil and grew in size. This has led to the rate of port calls in Malta shrinking, as we can no longer accommodate these ships with our facilities. As a result, we must start looking at expanding the economic sector to gradually shift away from our reliance on the port - there have been several suggestions but expanding our maritime facilities, nurturing a tourist economy, and even banking are the most prevalent ones."

This is also the first significant step to allowing us to slowly rebuild our economic prosperity. We have also acquired private investors from surrounding nations to finance these efforts. This has allowed us to begin the process of constructing upgraded jetties and docks to further enhance the efficiency of our ports, enabling them to receive larger vessels.

We also plan to add new ports and harbors to further accommodate larger ships from all over the world. This will allow us to increase trade and tourism, further increasing our prosperity. Finally, we plan to finish modernize our existing ports and harbors to ensure efficient operations, along with a dry dock to also allow for maintenance operations and ship repairs.

In order to preserve some self-determination, we are looking into expanding our aquaculture sector to expand our fishing industry. The Mediterranean hosts a massive variety of wealth of natural creations of which we can surely increase our catch from - especially the Atlantic Bluefin tuna.

This will limit the strain placed on local farmers for the time being. We must also develop long-term strategies to increase our agricultural production capacity to some extent and secure our food supply for the future, as conflict looms on the horizon. To stockpile wheat and other grains, we will contact nations such as France, Italy, and Ukraine to determine whether agreements can be reached to aid us in our precarious situation.

Our archipelago now stands at the precipice of its new future, for citizens across Malta could easily wake up to one of two very different realities as the power vacuum rushes to be filled. \n\nThe two main groups currently holding the strength, ties, and support necessary to seize power peacefully with the support of at least a decent percent of the population are the Republicans, rallying around three main democratic parties, and the Knights of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. With the SMOM’s reputation as a German interest group growing, they may experience some pushback, but with the rising Socialist tendencies within some groups inside the Labour Party, they may be needed to keep Malta from Socialism. We must tread carefully, for our destiny is dawning, and we best make the right choices now so as to not sully our new found freedom."

However, just a few miles away, a far larger uprising was growing in St. Paul’s Bay, Malta’s largest and most industrialized city. Long a hotspot for Socialist thought, especially among the intelligentsia and the local dockhands and factory workers, St. Paul’s Bay is now engulfed in popular uprising as the local Socialist cells, riled up and antagonized to action by the Knights and by their new allies in Socialist Italy. This uprising, bringing with it a mass general strike, has crippled Malta’s fledgling economy, and the Knights must act soon if they have any hope at stopping the Red Menace.

However, the rising radical faction led avowed Socialist Dominic Mintoff has seen skyrocketing support, and now poses a serious threat to Boffa’s long standing dominance. More concerningly, these ‘Radikali’ have been reported to not even be true Labourists at all, instead being infiltrators from the various Socialist and Syndicalist cells that stalk Malta, though these reports have been from our contacts in the SMOM and it is not known if we can truly trust them. Driven on in secret through funding from Socialists in Italy, these Radicals have long duped their partymates, and now may even have the power to seize the Labour nomination.

Their main opponent are the Knights themselves, whose Sovereign Military Order of Malta has long been the lords of our archipelago, but have lost respect over the years due to their bending to Germany and their ineffectiveness in stopping the New Sons of Malta. Should this faction of the Party win election, it is likely the Knights would simply use the mandate to fully instate themselves into absoulte power. The darkshorse candidates are from the ‘Radikali’ - a group of radical and young Nationalist who holding their love for Malta and the Lord above all, they are led by George Borg Olivier.

Whether it be the Sicilian Arabs of the long-gone Emirate or the French and British who both had their time as lords over this paradise within the Mediterranean, the islands rarely have been allowed to live their own way, and when they have, it was usually under the watch of the historic and heroic Knights of Malta. \n\nHowever, the Knights have fallen far from grace, and now largely exist as pro-German sycophants - a husk of their past power save for the few circles of radicals that still cling to the old ways. Led by the 76th Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere-Albani, the SMOM, long existing in a state of exile, were reinstated by the Kaiserreich as a means to both have a strong hand and to keep the Catholic population happy, as to keep the Grand Harbor running without issue. Allied and heavily backed by the Kaiserreich and its new Maltese Garrison, the Knights ruled as a soft military government while Germany mainly uses the islands as an airstrip. This military government largely held on unopposed on the surface, but across the underground of Malta, Republican protests and Socialist agents worked to undermine their rule at every turn. Meanwhile, a highly secretive group of disenfranchised Maltese businessmen and aristocrats formed the so-called New Sons of Malta. Pulling the strings from afar as they amassed their wealth and power in secret using a variety of dubious and black market methods, the New Sons sought to drive Germany from Malta at cost, all from behind the scenes. \nn\nThis scheming came to a head in late 1930, when the Kaiserreich, unaware of the growing local racial tensions, decided to allow the native Maltese to form a civilian government underneath the Knights’ watch. Despite the local Nationalist-Conservative party, the ‘Partit Nazzjonalista’, winning the local elections, their rule was quickly and completely undermined when the New Sons of Malta finally played their hand. Appearing from the shadows like phantoms, they moved unseen, working with blackmail and extortion, bribery and assassination, to completely cripple both the German-Knights coalition government and the newly elected Partit Nazzjonalista cabinet, effectively freezing Maltese politics. With this secret society of elites and mysterious financiers seizing power over Malta, they have managed to rule for nearly six years, duping the German delegation and Berlin the entire time. \n\nHowever, the New Sons are far from secure in their rule, for after funding from their respective favored Italian factions and from the New Sons themselves in a bid to destabilize the German Garrison, the Democratic parties and Socialist cells within Malta have gained great power. Worse yet for them, a radical wing of the Knights which wishes to see Jerusalem reclaimed, have started to grow in popularity and Germany has begun to catch on to the New Sons’ plot, despite sedition acts passed by their puppeted façade government sending panic and disorganization through the archipelago. With these tensions rising, and the Republicans increasingly more vocal in their desire for new elections and an end to the clearly fake government’s charade, it would seem that time is ticking for the New Sons, and Malta shall soon be free to choose its destiny once again."

Devoutly Catholic, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and ever chivalrous and stalwart, this knightly military order has faded into and out of prominence for centuries, but once again finds itself thrust into national prominence as the New Sons and their coalition collapse. Viewed by some as traitors due to their ties with the Kaiserreich, the SMOM is fiercely dedicated to Maltese nationalism and the preservation of our archipelago, declaring adamantly that their cooperation with Germany is purely seen as a necessity to preserve Maltese culture and the survival of our people. Preaching for a pious and stable Malta tied to the German Empire, the front-face of the Order hides a more independent, illustrious, and possibly deluded secret faction that holds far greater aspirations for the archipelago tied to former and long-dead glories. Regardless of their obsession with the past and that they possibly harbor far more dangerous zealots and radicals within their ranks, the Order is wholly devoted to protecting Malta in perpetuity, no matter the cost. Once the German Garrison is forced from the island in accordance with the Great Plan, the SMOM will once again play their party to ensure Maltese independence, for they are planned to become the main military of the nation, and regardless of their political aspirations, there they shall serve admirably in the defense of the nation, though we will have to keep tabs their deep ties to the Partit Nazzjonalista.

Coalescing under a provisional government until the first elections can be organized and held - if and only when our gamble pays off, the current democratic scene is mainly divided into three camps: Partit Nazzjonalista, Partit Kostituzzjonali, and Partit Laburista. \n\nThe Partit Nazzjonalista is a right-wing, conservative, and nationalist party that is divided into three subfactions all vying for influence: the Ċentristi who are mainly moderates split between either preferring cooperation with Italy or maintaining full independence, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta who seek to bring measured military rule Malta while maintaining ties to the Kaiserreich, and the Radikali - a faction that seeks to restablish a strong and Maltese state, arm-in-arm with the Church. \n\nThe Partit Kostituzzjonali is the main liberal party of Malta, forming the middleground of the democratic process.  Split between a more capitalistic Konservatiivi faction and a more progressive Liberali faction, the party still largely agrees that cooperation with the Entente is the best way forward for Malta, and has pursued close ties with the Algiers Regime and Canada. \n\nThe least cemented camp is the Partit Laburista, which is currently caught in an internal rift the party hides from the public and its supporters. Paul Boffa leads the base of the party as a champion of European-style Social Democracy and non-Syndicalist labourite policies, but his position has been slowly eroded away by the Radikali led by Dominic Mintoff and Carmelo Borg Pisani. These Radikali have surged to prominence due to a large influx of funding coming from the Socialist Republic of Italy - something our organization has been hard at work to ensure, and have begun to steal supporters from Boffa’s labourites in an attempt to quietly seize the party. \n\nTogether, these varied groups make up the republican elements of Malta, and with these desperate democrats in our hands, the Grand Plan is sure to succeed."
mlt.10.a:0 "Virtute et constantia!"

mlt.11.t:0 "The Socialist Vermin of Malta"
mlt.11.d:0 "For many years, the Partit Laburista has harbored a tumor. Slowly growing and metastasizing throughout the party, the cancer of radical Socialism has infected Paul Boffa’s beloved hub of social democracy. Fueled, supplied, radicalized, and influenced by the Third Internationale - primarily Italy - these Socialist cells have begun to take over the Partit Laburista, slowly pushing Boffa out of his own party while the rest of the nation is none the wiser. Led by Dominic Mintoff, an avowed Christian Socialist taking inspiration from Italy’s Alceste De Ambris and Giacomo Matteoti, and Carmelo Borg Pisani, a Maltese nationalist who greatly amires and seeks to emulates Bennito Mussolini’s Totalism while also pulling from Italo Balbo’s ideas. These ‘Radikali’ seek to infiltrate democracy and tear it down from within. Though much of the nation remains unaware of these rats and their vile plot, Paul Boffa and his labourites currently are engaged in political war for the soul of the Partit Laburista and possibly for the fate of the nation. Despite their current goals and feud with the Labourites, these Socialists still have a part to play in the Grand Plan, and with our guidance and additional financial assistance, they too shall help our gamble pay off."

mlt.12.t:0 "Malta Declares Independence!"
mlt.12.d:0 "With the fallout from Black Monday continuing to wreak havoc upon both our economy and the wider empire at large, our great and mighty Kaiserreich has begun to falter; our tendrils of influence that once spread across the globe now wither and die as local groups use this time of weakness to enact their dastardly plans for independence. Across the Kaiserreich, bastions of German influence falter to native unrest and seditious activity, usurping our colonial mandates and military garrisons in the far reaches of our Empire. \n\nOne such region using this time of instability to their advantage is Malta. A group calling themselves the 'New Sons of Malta' have used their considerable fortunes to rally the local Maltese political factions under a shared banner in a semi-cohesive and barely-cooperating coalition aimed at toppling our  garrison that has held the islands since the fall of the British Empire. Though these ‘New Sons’ have vast amounts of wealth at their disposal, their influence has been vastly drowned out by the swelling tide of Maltese nationalist and nativist sentiments that have consumed the archipelago, and their ‘rule’ over Malta shall soon and assuredly fall to one of the myriad of local political factions that have temporarily set aside their differences to free their islands from our grasp. \n\nDespite being an important naval and air base for the Kaiserreich, Malta serves no larger or necessary purpose within our empire, and with Black Monday still ravaging our economy, we are in little position to stop them. It seems Malta has won its independence, at least for now."
mlt.12.a:0 "Oh no! Anyway..."


mlt.13.t:0 "The Collapse of the New Sons of Malta"
mlt.13.d:0 "Using their vast fortunes and political ties, the varied and anonymous financiers and captains of industry that make up the New Sons of Malta have saved our archipelago from the grasp of the Hun and their greedy Kaiser. By funding and supplying all political groups within the nation, ranging from the Republican elements shackled under the German Garrison to the various nationalist and socialist cells and groups that pervade these islands, the New Sons have propelled the Maltese people to carry themselves to victory. However, this situation has spiralled out of the control of the New Sons, for the very movements they once funded have swelled to be both uncontrollable and no longer beholden to these bored rich men masquerading as a secret order. \n\nShortly after the German flag was torn down over Valletta, so too was the shadow order of the New Sons, with their identities revealed and their surviving members forced to flee the island lest they face retribution. Our Malta, now freed from the grasp of both the Hun and the New Sons, is now free to pursue its own destiny, and with the ever tumultuous political landscape of our small archipelago now free to blast off in a new direction, our newly freed nation and people now stand at a crossroads as the coalition created by the New Sons collapses nearly as quickly as it formed. We must brace ourselves for the future as we move to establish a provisional government in the wake of this new shift until a more permanent direction can be established."
mlt.13.a:0 "For a free and independent Malta!"

mlt.14.t:0 "Malta Secures Independence!"
mlt.14.d:0 "Following the disaster that was Black Monday, the Kaiserreich was beset by numerous uprisings and revolts within nations and territories under their grasp as local populations across their  empire attempted to stab the Global Hegemon in the back as it lay weak and exposed. Though most of these revolts proved to be fruitless wastes of human life, the same cannot be said for what has occurred in the small archipelago of Malta, which has recently secured their own independence after a local masonic order known as the New Sons of Malta supplied seperatist forces on the island and roused them to establish a temporary coalition and rebel. These so-called 'New Sons' however, were unable to secure their rule and collapsed just as quickly as Malta it's gained freedom. Now, with their financiers forced to flee the island and with the German flag over Valletta now lowered, the small island nation of Malta stands at a crossroads while the rest of the world rages around them."
mlt.14.a:0 "The Heart of Mediterranean rises into freedom."

mlt.15.t:0 "A Return to Tradition?" 
mlt.15.d:0 "With our hold over Malta now secure, the time has finally come to square away one of the largest internal problems facing the Order of St. John. While always existing in a form of militaristic nostalgia, but greatly invigorated by the New Sons, a sect of the order has long wished for a return to our crusading origins. While not directly linked to founding of the great Crusader Kingdoms, our order was founded within the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and we are perhaps one of the last vestiges of that long-dead Kingdom to still exist. This fact has lead many within the order, especially those in the younger generation, to yearn for a return to the old order, one in which Catholicism and Catholic Kings and Princes ruled over the Holy Land. Having ties to the Austrian Order of the Golden Fleece and viewing Austria as the one power that may actually support such a rival, this grouping poses little actual threat to the Order of St. John as a whole. Despite this, due to the fact that the Order is the undisputed master of Malta, their presence could possibly lead to disunity in the future. Thus, the Grandmaster has called for a general assembly to finally make a ruling on these radical traditionalists , once and for all."

mlt.28.d:0 "Whilst Malta may have lost its icon of the knights who stood sentinel of the isle, it has gained some new heroes of the proletarian masses on the island. These heroes are those corsairs that have begun striking out from the isle, using fast boats and highly professional tactics (skills that some speculate originate from the elite body of the disbanded knights)to board and seize vessels throughout the mediterranean. The shock assaults and daring maneuvers have surprised the quiet and previously peaceful seas, as now these skillful pirates under the red banner of revolution have performed impressive feats. From directly striking at bustling harbors where they can capture even more plunder from the stored goods on the piers, to direct strikes unto Entente and German military vessels, where our red corsairs have shown a particular venom towards the imperialists who had a influence upon our island, yet did nothing to lift any of the workers from poverty. These redistributors of the high seas have gained much acclaim here at home, where when they return from a successful nautical voyage, they spread the goods to the population. The mystery of these pirates who leave and return with shared plunder is making the waves in a literal sense, as now all in the sea learn of the name ‘blackheart’, and can only speculate as reports of legions of these corsairs venture out of their blackstone coves. Some of the more cowardly of our government have voiced concerns about bringing the wrath of larger powers unto our isle by giving such open love to these pirates that originate from here, but what must we fear when our shores are guarded by such revolutionary elites?"

mlt.29.t:0 "The Red Knights of Malta" 
mlt.29.d:0 "Today, the tiled streets and busy cornerstones of Malta rang out to the lockstep of boots and a drummer’s tune. But rather than what the workers feared to be a resurgence of archaic knights marching to a foreign whip, they were shocked by the greeting of the Sovereign Order’s banner, now accompanied on its weave by a red star. The Knights barracks and monastery’s now blare internationalist songs from their trumpets, while glass panes of Jesus and Saint Paul of Tarsus among others replace the old kings that reigned over Malta and the crusader kingdoms. The radio cries out with announcements from the Prime Minister's office, where the change was announced concurrently with the knights reveal parade. These are Malta’s new guardians. The ones who had stood guard over Maltese customs for so long have not been tossed aside with the revolution, but given new heart as they can be reformed into the life-aid’s of the masses, who shall embrace proletarian ideals alongside their love of the isle’s identity. The once tight order has been opened up to the public, where any good laborer who wishes to become a sentinel of the people’s struggle can now join them, although that does not make entrance any easier. The demand for them to remain an elite corps militarily, and highly prestigious in the ceremonial aspect has meant the tough screening remains, blocking out any quiet quitters weak of will."
