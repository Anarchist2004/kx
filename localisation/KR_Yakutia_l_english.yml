### Events ###
yak.1.t:0 "Sakha Sire!"
yak.1.d:0 "For too long have we being oppressed by the Russian colonists, who brought their culture, taxes and diseases. We never received the autonomy we desired, and now, while Kolchak's country is slowly dissolving, we must proclaim our independence. The provisional government of VYaONU, consisting of Yakut Oblastniki has declared the independence of Sakha people."
yak.1.a:0 "Independence!"

yak.2.t:0 "The Yakut People's Army"
yak.2.d:0 "The Yakut people's Army, which was destroyed by the Russian troops and forgotten, must be revived. We need professional fighters who are ready to defend our country from the greatest threat."
yak.2.a:0 "The army will bring us safety"

yak.3.t:0 "Sending a Special Division to Yakutia?"
yak.3.d:0 "While we are dealing with internal chaos, the Yakuts have seceded, but they don't have any organized force to fight back. They can only use their landscape to fight us. Perhaps we shall send a division avoiding the main tracts and try to encircle them and capture Yakutsk.\n\nThere are two choices: Innokentiy Smolin, a talented general, who was born in Yakutsk and who knows well the area or Anatoliy Pepelyaev, our field marshal, who is definetely more experienced than Smolin and proved to be a good soldier."
yak.3.a:0 "Send there Smolin"
yak.3.b:0 "Send there Pepelyaev"
yak.3.c:0 "We don't see any reasons to send there our generals."


yak.4.t:0 "Siberian Army Division in Yakutia"
yak.4.d:0 "It seems that the [TRM.GetAdjective] government has sent a special division to our region, avoiding the Tracts, perhaps to encircle and crush us. Our partisans have already found the division, consisting of about 100 soldiers, though knowing their professionalism, the battle can be too costly for us. We can leave them alone, hoping they will die in the Yakutian Winter, or try to start a battle with them."
yak.4.a:0 "Not a single Siberian soldier in our territory!"
yak.4.b:0 "Don't waste our time on them - they will probably be dead by tomorrow."

yak.5.t:0 "The Siberian Army Captures Yakutsk!"
yak.5.d:0 "The Siberian Army Division has seized our capital city, leaving our border security without any supplies. [ROOT.GetLeader] has been arrested and now the Siberian Army demands we give up."
yak.5.a:0 "We shall fight back for our independence!"
yak.5.b:0 "We give up!"

yak.6.t:0 "Siberian Army Crushed!"
yak.6.d:0 "We have crushed the Siberian division and let them die in torment. Their leader has been arrested and taken into prison in Yakutsk. We sent an ultimatum to the Far-Eastern government that if they don't recognize our independence, their general will be executed."
yak.6.a:0 "A victory for Yakut People!"

yak.7.t:0 "The Siberian Division Lost in Snow"
yak.7.d:0 "We still have no reports on the Sibirian Division of Pepelyaev, it seems that there were lost in snow and dead now. This operation became another another failure of our regime and a loss of a talented general."
yak.7.a:0 "Rest in Peace, Anatoliy"

yak.8.t:0 "Yakutsk Battle Lost"
yak.8.d:0 "We lost the battle of Yakutsk and once again became just a colony of Russians. Innokentiy Smolin, proclaiming himself the Governor of Yakutia, has established military control over capital city. Even though there are still partisans, fighting for their freedom, it seems that the independence of Sakha people is doomed."
yak.8.a:0 "The End of Yakut Winter."

yak.9.t:0 "Governorate of Yakutia"
yak.9.d:0 "The division of Smolin has successfully seized control over Yakutia, destroying the opposition to our regime."
yak.9.a:0 "That is great!"

yak.10.t:0 "Yakut Spring"
yak.10.d:0 "The ice melted and now we are a totally independent state. The border control at the Yakutian Tracts has been established and now we don't allow anybody enter or leave our country. Of course, this measures are temporarily, until we finally realize that the Russians respect our sovereignity. It is time to hold the first elections and decide on our national flag."
yak.10.a:0 "Yakut people are strong."

yak.11.t:0 "Yakut Soldiers Raise the White Flag"
yak.11.d:0 "It seems that our resistance was vain. The Yakut soldiers, unable to contain the Siberian Army are raising the white flags and surrender. The Siberian Army is already approaching Yakutsk, and there is nothing we can do now, but to give up the power to Russians."
yak.11.a:0 "A Tragedy!"

yak.12.t:0 "Smuggling Foreign Equipment"
yak.12.d:0 "Our young republic needs weapons to protect its borders, but as a result of the lack of any significant production plants, we are forced to buy weapons from Japan clandestinely. Once a month, we will receive weapons supplies from them, but the success of these deliveries directly depends on the Japanese. At some point, their supply may be intercepted by enemy countries, or they themselves may refuse further supplies, but in these realities we are forced to exist now."
yak.12.a:0 "Let's start!"

yak.13.t:0 "Smuggling Equipment to [FROM.GetName]"
yak.13.d:0 "We have negotiated with [FROM.GetAdjective] government to smuggle them weapons every month, even though this can be dangerous and there is a chance our shipment won't reach its destination. We are free to reject this illegal trade even now, but if we want to help Yakuts in their fight against Russians, they will definetely need some guns."
yak.13.a:0 "Send them a bunch of weapons."
yak.13.b:0 "That's too risky..."

yak.14.t:0 "Weapons From [FROM.GetName]"
yak.14.d:0 "The shipment of Japanese weapons has reached our borders and we successfully received our weapons!"
yak.14.a:0 "Waiting for the next delivery!"

yak.15.t:0 "Weapons Captured"
yak.15.d:0 "The weapons that were sent to the Yakuts have been captured by Russians! This brings us to the discussion if we should stop our shipments, as we risk to arm the Russian soldiers with free Japanese guns!"
yak.15.a:0 "We shall still try to send them weapons."
yak.15.b:0 "That's too risky..."

yak.16.t:0 "Successful Shipment to Yakutia!"
yak.16.d:0 "The shipment of our weapons has reached the borders of Yakutia and they successfully received our weapons!"
yak.16.a:0 "Send them more!"
yak.16.b:0 "That's too risky..."

yak.17.t:0 "Japan Stops the Shipments!"
yak.17.d:0 "It seems that the [JAP.GetAdjective] government has stopped sending us the equipment, perhaps because of the frequent interceptions."
yak.17.a:0 "We have to cope ourselves now!"

yak.18.t:0 "Yhyakh Celebration!"
yak.18.d:0 "Sakha people celebrate the New Year in summer – according to the ancient traditions. The winter temperatures sometimes reach minus 60°C, while the summer is very short, lasting only three months. The holiday is celebrated in the middle of June, at the beginning of summer.\nThe Sakha Yhyakh festival (literally meaning "abundance") is related to a cult of a solar deity, with a fertility cult. Ancient Sakha celebrated the New Year at the Yhyakh festival. Its traditions include women and children decorating trees and tethering posts with "salama" (nine bunches of horse hair hung on horse-hair ropes). The oldest man, wearing white, opens the holiday. He starts the ritual by sprinkling kymys on the ground, feeding the fire. He prays to the Aiy spirits for the well-being of the people who depend on them and asks the spirits to bless all the people gathered. Afterwards, people sing and dance Ohuakhai, play national games, eat national dishes, and drink kymys."
yak.18.a:0 "Khaya-D'yenke!

yak.19.t:0 "Choosing the National Flag"
yak.19.d:0 "Originally used in the Yakut Uprising in 1918, the flag was a black-white-red tricolor, and was indistinguishable from the civil flag of the German Empire. Until now, the flag has remained an unchanged symbol of the Yakut independence. However, in connection with the emergence of our state, many members of the government think that perhaps a new flag is needed, which would more accurately symbolize the Sakha people, and not be associated with the German Imperial flag. There is also a second variant, the white-green-black tricolor, where the White color symbolizes Siberian snow, green-taiga, and black-earth, which of course more reflects the national characteristics of Sakha"
yak.19.a:0 "Black-White-Red tricolor"
yak.19.b:0 "White-Green-Black tricolor"

yak.20.t:0 "[GetYear] Yakut Constituent Elections"
yak.20.d:0 "The time has come for people of Yakutia to vote. There are 4 parties present at the elections.\nThe leftists, MNSPSBK(k) or Confederalists, led by Pavel Ksenofontov are seeking to establish an equal and modernized Yakut society based on ideas of fraternity and socialism. Their ideas though are based on the Bukharin's ideology of market socialism as Ksenofontov believes that only through having a solid national economy with progressive taxation Sakha will prosper.\n\nThe second party is the Federalists, led by Gavriil Ksenofontov (a namesake of the previous candidate, though), who believe that Yakut people should be educated and live in a capitalist society, though his views on autonomy is quite tolerant.\n\nThe third party are the Conservatives, led by Kulumnuur, a representative from Yakut intelligentsia, who was once elected the Governor of Yakutia in 1918, though quickly losing his position in the chaos of the Civil War. First off, their main goal is to preserve the Sakha culture.\n\nThe last but not the least is the nationalist party of Urangai Sakha, led by an eccentric poet and writer Platon Oyunsky, whose views, while being rather close to the Conservatives, are a bit more radical. He believes that only through independence and armed defence the Sakha people will prosper.\nThe elections have already started in Yakutsk and soon we will know the results." 
yak.20.a:0 "Confederalists!"
yak.20.b:0 "Federalists!"
yak.20.c:0 "Conservatives!"
yak.20.e:0 "Nationalists!"

yak.21.t:0 "Sakha Constitution"
yak.21.d:0 "There is only one thing Pavel Ksenofontov is absolutely sure to become the main achievement of the Sakha people - the Constitution, which will guarantee its independence, development and safety of cultural norms and traditions. The adoption of Consitution is an essential step in our nation-building process."
yak.21.a:0 "Glory to the Constitution!"

yak.22.t:0 "First Stage of Vseobuch"
yak.22.d:0 "Vseobuch, short for Universal Education , is the beginning of the rebirth of the Yakut people from the colonial period. The state will allocate money for the construction of schools and universities, so that young and adult Yakuts learn writing and mathematics and can move our society forward."
yak.22.a:0 "A Great Reform!"

yak.23.t:0 "New Foreign Partners"
yak.23.d:0 "Esablishing friendly relations with foreign nations is considered to be an important step in building our country. We shall send delegations to the Great Powers of the world and ask for their recognition of our state and, perhaps, even to open their Embassies in Yakutsk. Their recognition will show to the world that Sakha are strong and that our nation is respected."
yak.23.a:0 "Let's wait for their answers."

yak.24.t:0 "Yakutia Seeks For Recognition"
yak.24.d:0 "The nation of Yakuts have recently declared their independence and now they are seeking for international recognition of their state. While formally recognizing them will definetely worsen our relations with Russia, perhaps it is not so bad as it can seem?"
yak.24.a:0 "We will recognize them"
yak.24.b:0 "We will recognize them and open an Embassy there."
yak.24.c:0 "Who?.."

yak.25.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Recognizes Us"
yak.25.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Ministry of Foreign Affairs has agreed to recognize our independence. Now we shall send them a request to invest in our economy..."
yak.25.a:0 "A Great Victory for Sakha people!"

yak.26.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Will Open Embassy in Yakutsk"
yak.26.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recognized our independence and even agreed to open their embassy in Yakutsk. Now we shall send them a request to invest in our economy..."

yak.27.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused to Recognize Us!"
yak.27.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] have refused to recognize our state..."
yak.27.a:0 "Too bad..."

yak.28.t:0 "Invest in [FROM.GetName]?"
yak.28.d:0 "The Yakut government offered us to invest in their economy. They claim that gold has already been found in their area, and that they are now in search of the so-called 'blue clay', whatever that means."
yak.28.a:0 "A new Klondike?"
yak.28.b:0 "They are too far away"

yak.29.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Agreed to Invest!"
yak.29.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government agreed to invest in our economy, which is definetely great for us!"
yak.29.a:0 "A toast to our new friends!"

yak.30.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused to Invest!"
yak.30.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to invest in our economy, which is definetely not too great for us"
yak.30.a:0 "Well, at least they recognized us!"

yak.31.t:0 "The Reformation Period"
yak.31.d:0 "A complex of measures to improve our national-cultural development has been accepted by the president [ROOT.GetLeader] and soon they will be implemented. They include subsidies for local farmers and landowners, increased wages for workers and low taxes for citizens. It seems we are definetely closer and closer to become a true state."
yak.31.a:0 "Splendid!"

yak.32.t:0 "The Local Traditions Bill"
yak.32.d:0 "President [ROOT.GetLeader] has introduced a bill, that will legitimize our local customs and traditions, such as making Yhyakh, a national New Year celebration, a public holiday. Moreover, cattle breeding and fishing and hunting will become state-protected industries of national economy, which will guarantee high salary for the employees. As [ROOT.GetLeader] mentions, more customs and traditions will be legitimized as well, bringing prosperity to our nation and at the same time preserve our culture."
yak.32.a:0 "That's great!"

yak.33.t:0 "The Great Yytachy"
yak.33.d:0 "The very word 'President' is a concept imposed by Russia, which is not inherent in our people, which denies the very essence of Sakha. Our national leader is the person who will guide our country on the path to prosperity, so he should be given the appropriate name. From now on, our leader will call Yytachy, or The Guide. Faith in his great rule will help our people to cope with all the troubles, especially with the Russian colonizers."
yak.33.a:0 "Long Live Yytachy!"

yak.34.t:0 "The Fate of Evenks"
yak.34.d:0 "The people of the Evenks, or Tungus, who inhabit the lower reaches of the Lena River, although not completely under the jurisdiction of our state, have minorities on our territory. They are not our kindred people, coming from Mongolia and China, who profess a different faith and do not recognize us, the Sakha, as the legitimate rulers of the Sakha. And the position of the Great Guide is as follows. The Evenks must recognize the Sakha and recognize themselves as the Sakha. Otherwise, they have no place on the territory of our country. Let them leave here or become us. Nothing else is given."
yak.34.a:0 "Isn't it too cruel?"

yak.35.t:0 "Urung Aar Toyon"
yak.35.d:0 "The Aiys are the inhabitants of the Upper World, the progenitors of the Sakha people, the supreme patrons who gave our people independence. Thanks to their support, we managed to survive. Shamanism and the belief in Aiy, previously persecuted by Russian colonists, will now be free and institutionalized. Urung Aar Toyon, oh the Bright Creator Lord, bring glory and prosperity to our people, we, the flock of yours, pray to you!"
yak.35.a:0 "The Brightest Lords of Sakha"

yak.50.t:0 "Aldanzoloto Industries"
yak.50.d:0 "In 1923, when Yakutia was still a Russian territory, gold was found by Yakut free prospectors on the banks of the Aldan River. The development of the mines was prevented by the Kolchak putsch, as a result of which Yakutia became part of Transamur. Despite the fact that the mines continued to be developed, the pace was very low. Now that Yakutia is finally independent, we can attract foreign investors and creditors and form the Aldanzoloto Industries state Trust for the purpose of extracting this valuable mineral and its subsequent sale. Thanks to the trust, Yakutia will become one of the richest countries in the Far East."
yak.50.a:0 "Sakha Klondike is opened!"

yak.51.t:0 "The New Expedition to Find the §CBlue Clay§!"
yak.51.d:0 "The pathfinder and guide Ulukitkan, known throughout Yakutia, became one of the leaders of the blue clay search expedition. Many years ago, rumors spread across Siberia about the existence of an amazing blue clay-sparkling and incredibly durable. However, these were just rumors spread by some fools. Despite the fact that there was distrust of this information, by this time it was already known about the discovery of precious diamonds in South Africa and the Kolchak government unsuccessfully tried to find diamonds in Yakutia. Valuable stones would serve as sources of wealth for the country and for people.\n\nNow, the expedition is headed by an experienced Yakut guide, who will definitely be able to help in the discovery of diamonds in Yakutia."
yak.51.a:0 "Good luck to them!"

yak.52.t:0 "The Discovery Of a Diamond Deposit!"
yak.52.d:0 "This is incredible! We did not rely on Ulukitkan for nothing. Thanks to his knowledge of the terrain and hidden places, we came across a whole diamond deposit. A sample of diamond rock has already been delivered to Yakutsk, and leading experts on precious stones have also been invited."
yak.52.a:0 "That's incredible!"

yak.53.t:0 "Diamonds Discovered in Yakutia"
yak.53.d:0 "The news have reached the world from the partially recognized state of Yakutia in the heart of Siberian Taiga.\n\nLocated in the basin of the river Lena in the Eastern Siberia, Yakutia is known for its rich gold mines, already named the New Klondike. Now, it seems, that their land is also rich with diamonds. Several foreign powers are already starting negotiations to invest in Yakutia and have better conditions to trade with them."
yak.53.a:0 "Unbelievable!"

yak.54.t:0 "Independence of Yakutia"
yak.54.d:0 "A new country has emerged in the Eastern Siberia. The Sakha people, or Yakuts, have used the chaos in the Far-Eastern Republic of Transamur to declare their independence and once again establish their own state.\n\nAlready rebelling against Russian yoke, the last most successful revolt was in 1919, during the Russian Civil War. Now, it seems that the Yakuts have finally secured their independence against the Russians."
yak.54.a:0 "Where is it even located?"

yak.60.t:0 "Trial of VYaONU"
yak.60.d:0 "An extremist group of Yakut national separatists, calling themselves the Provisional Yakut Regional People's Administration, headed by Georgy Efimov, are accused of high treason to the Supreme Ruler of Russia. Having seized power in the Yakut region, the accused declared the overthrow of the Russian government in Yakutia and the proclamation of an independent state, which is contrary to the Constitution of Russia of 1921, and contrary to the decree of the Supreme Ruler of 1925 on the indivisibility and impossibility of alienating the territories of Russia. On the basis of these documents, the perpetrators are sentenced to death by firing squad."
yak.60.a:0 "Traitors of Russia!"

yak.61.t:0 "The New Supreme Ruler"
yak.61.d:0 "Due to the Kolchak's failure, Smolin considers that there is no other way, but claim the mantle of the Supreme Ruler of Russia.\n\nEven though he is captured here, in Yakutia, among resistant Yakuts, perhaps this is the only thing he has to do. The chances of reclaiming all of Russia are very low - but perhaps this will play out."
yak.61.a:0 "Long live the Supreme Ruler!"

yak.70.t:0 "The Socialist Unrest"
yak.70.d:0 "outraged by our authoritarian rule, in some villages the most enterprising citizens declared their distrust of our government. The Yakut peasants insist on social protection and privileges for them, while our policy drives them into poverty and misery, while the nobility rejoices.\n\nCitizens unite under the slogans 'All power - to the Yakut Council' and 'We trust Ammosov, not [ROOT.GetLeader]'. We can subsidize the peasants and hope that they will be satisfied, or we can ignore their demands."
yak.70.a:0 "Help the poor!"
yak.70.b:0 "Who are they to dictate the rules?"

yak.71.t:0 "Socialist Revolution!"
yak.71.d:0 "Enraged by the disregard for them, the Yakut peasants, united by Ammosov, declared their disobedience to our government. From all villages and villages, peasants are uniting under red flags and have announced a march to Yakutsk in order to seize power into their own hands. Our government mobilized the Yakut Army in order to calm the rebels, but the soldiers, the same ordinary Yakuts, refused to shoot at the rebels and suppress the protest, and some even joined. The beneficiaries of the uprising - the Ammosov clique, also known as YaNSP, broke into the building of the Council of Yakutia, and using their advantage, arrested and suspended former members of the government, including [ROOT.GetLeader]. After that, the flag of Yakutia was removed, and a red banner was raised instead. Ammosov declared the victory of the Soviets and declared himself the First Chairman of Yakutia."
yak.71.a:0 "Long live Soviet Yakutia!"

yak.100.t:0 "Offer From [FROM.GetName]"
yak.100.d:0 "The 'government' of [FROM.GetName] has approached us with an offer to join our country as a region with wide autonomy. We can always reject if we consider their territory as integral part of our country, but perhaps we should respect their desire to have autonomy?"
yak.100.a:0 "We agree."
yak.100.b:0 "No, we must claim their territory!"

yak.101.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Agrees!"
yak.101.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government agreed to give us wide autonomy. We will save our current government and even national elections!"

yak.102.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
yak.102.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to give us wide autonomy. Moreover, they claimed our territory as their rightful. We must be ready for war."

yak.103.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetName] has approached us with a friendly request to join our alliance. Will we accept them?"

yak.104.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses Alliance!"
yak.104.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to have us in their alliance. This is a great disgrace, but we will be good on our own."

yak.200.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Invades Siberia!"
yak.200.d:0 "The self-proclaimed [FROM.GetAdjective] government has invaded their 'claims' in Eastern Siberia, violating our borders, since the area is impassable for the troups or any border security. We must do something!"
yak.200.a:0 "Declare war on them!"
yak.200.b:0 "We can't do it now!"

yak.201.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Invades Okhotsk!"
yak.201.d:0 "The self-proclaimed [FROM.GetAdjective] government has invaded their 'claims' in Eastern Siberia, violating our border with only reason to have access to the sea. What shall we do?"
yak.201.a:0 "Let them have this..."
yak.201.b:0 "Declare war on them!"
