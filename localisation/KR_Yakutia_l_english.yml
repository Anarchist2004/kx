### Events ###
yak.1.t:0 "Sakha Sire!"
yak.1.d:0 "For too long have we being oppressed by the Russian colonists, who brought their culture, taxes and diseases. We never received the autonomy we desired, and now, while Kolchak's country is slowly dissolving, we must proclaim our independence. The provisional government of VYaONU, consisting of Yakut Oblastniki has declared the independence of Sakha people."
yak.1.a:0 "Independence!"

yak.2.t:0 "The Yakut People's Army"
yak.2.d:0 "The Yakut people's Army, which was destroyed by the Russian troops and forgotten, must be revived. We need professional fighters who are ready to defend our country from the greatest threat."
yak.2.a:0 "The army will bring us safety"

yak.3.t:0 "Sending a Special Division to Yakutia?"
yak.3.d:0 "While we are dealing with internal chaos, the Yakuts have seceded, but they don't have any organized force to fight back. They can only use their landscape to fight us. Perhaps we shall send a division avoiding the main tracts and try to encircle them and capture Yakutsk.\n\nThere are two choices: Innokentiy Smolin, a talented general, who was born in Yakutsk and who knows well the area or Anatoliy Pepelyaev, our field marshal, who is definetely more experienced than Smolin and proved to be a good soldier."
yak.3.a:0 "Send there Smolin"
yak.3.b:0 "Send there Pepelyaev"
yak.3.c:0 "We don't see any reasons to send there our generals."


yak.4.t:0 "Siberian Army Division in Yakutia"
yak.4.d:0 "It seems that the [TRM.GetAdjective] government has sent a special division to our region, avoiding the Tracts, perhaps to encircle and crush us. Our partisans have already found the division, consisting of about 100 soldiers, though knowing their professionalism, the battle can be too costly for us. We can leave them alone, hoping they will die in the Yakutian Winter, or try to start a battle with them."
yak.4.a:0 "Not a single Siberian soldier in our territory!"
yak.4.b:0 "Don't waste our time on them - they will probably be dead by tomorrow."

yak.5.t:0 "The Siberian Army Captures Yakutsk!"
yak.5.d:0 "The Siberian Army Division has seized our capital city, leaving our border security without any supplies. [ROOT.GetLeader] has been arrested and now the Siberian Army demands we give up."
yak.5.a:0 "We shall fight back for our independence!"
yak.5.b:0 "We give up!"

yak.6.t:0 "Siberian Army Crushed!"
yak.6.d:0 "We have crushed the Siberian division and let them die in torment. Their leader has been arrested and taken into prison in Yakutsk. We sent an ultimatum to the Far-Eastern government that if they don't recognize our independence, their general will be executed."
yak.6.a:0 "A victory for Yakut People!"

yak.7.t:0 "The Siberian Division Lost in Snow"
yak.7.d:0 "We still have no reports on the Sibirian Division of Pepelyaev, it seems that there were lost in snow and dead now. This operation became another another failure of our regime and a loss of a talented general."
yak.7.a:0 "Rest in Peace, Anatoliy"

yak.8.t:0 "Yakutsk Battle Lost"
yak.8.d:0 "We lost the battle of Yakutsk and once again became just a colony of Russians. Innokentiy Smolin, proclaiming himself the Governor of Yakutia, has established military control over capital city. Even though there are still partisans, fighting for their freedom, it seems that the independence of Sakha people is doomed."
yak.8.a:0 "The End of Yakut Winter."

yak.9.t:0 "Governorate of Yakutia"
yak.9.d:0 "The division of Smolin has successfully seized control over Yakutia, destroying the opposition to our regime."
yak.9.a:0 "That is great!"

yak.10.t:0 "Yakut Spring"
yak.10.d:0 "The ice melted and now we are a totally independent state. The border control at the Yakutian Tracts has been established and now we don't allow anybody enter or leave our country. Of course, this measures are temporarily, until we finally realize that the Russians respect our sovereignity. It is time to hold the first elections and decide on our national flag."
yak.10.a:0 "Yakut people are strong."

yak.12.t:0 "Smuggling Foreign Equipment"
yak.12.d:0 ""
yak.12.a:0 ""

yak.18.t:0 "Yhyakh Celebration!"
yak.18.d:0 "Sakha people celebrate the New Year in summer – according to the ancient traditions. The winter temperatures sometimes reach −60 °C, while the summer is very short, lasting only three months. The holiday is celebrated in the middle of June, at the beginning of summer.\nThe Sakha Yhyakh festival (literally meaning "abundance") is related to a cult of a solar deity, with a fertility cult. Ancient Sakha celebrated the New Year at the Yhyаkh festival. Its traditions include women and children decorating trees and tethering posts with "salama" (nine bunches of horse hair hung on horse-hair ropes). The oldest man, wearing white, opens the holiday. He starts the ritual by sprinkling kymys on the ground, feeding the fire. He prays to the Aiy spirits for the well-being of the people who depend on them and asks the spirits to bless all the people gathered. Afterwards, people sing and dance Ohuakhai, play national games, eat national dishes, and drink kymys."
yak.18.a:0 "Khaya-D'yenke!

yak.19.t:0 "Choosing the National Flag"
yak.19.d:0 "Originally used in the Yakut Uprising in 1918, the flag was a black-white-red tricolor, and was indistinguishable from the civil flag of the German Empire. Until now, the flag has remained an unchanged symbol of the Yakut independence. However, in connection with the emergence of our state, many members of the government think that perhaps a new flag is needed, which would more accurately symbolize the Sakha people, and not be associated with the German Imperial flag. There is also a second variant, the white-green-black tricolor, where the White color symbolizes Siberian snow, green-taiga, and black-earth, which of course more reflects the national characteristics of Sakha"
yak.19.a:0 "Black-White-Red tricolor"
yak.19.b:0 "White-Green-Black tricolor"

yak.20.t:0 "[GetYear] Yakut Constituent Elections"
yak.20.d:0 "The time has come for people of Yakutia to vote. There are 4 parties present at the elections.\nThe leftists, MNSPSBK(k) or Confederalists, led by Pavel Ksenofontov are seeking to establish an equal and modernized Yakut society based on ideas of fraternity and socialism. Their ideas though are based on the Bukharin's ideology of market socialism as Ksenofontov believes that only through having a solid national economy with progressive taxation Sakha will prosper.\n\nThe second party is the Federalists, led by Gavriil Ksenofontov (a namesake of the previous candidate, though), who believe that Yakut people should be educated and live in a capitalist society, though his views on autonomy is quite tolerant.\n\nThe third party are the Conservatives, led by Kulumnuur, a representative from Yakut intelligentsia, who was once elected the Governor of Yakutia in 1918, though quickly losing his position in the chaos of the Civil War. First off, their main goal is to preserve the Sakha culture.\n\nThe last but not the least is the nationalist party of Urangai Sakha, led by an eccentric poet and writer Platon Oyunsky, whose views, while being rather close to the Conservatives, are a bit more radical. He believes that only through independence and armed defence the Sakha people will prosper.\nThe elections have already started in Yakutsk and soon we will know the results." 
yak.20.a:0 "Confederalists!"
yak.20.b:0 "Federalists!"
yak.20.c:0 "Conservatives!"
yak.20.e:0 "Nationalists!"

yak.21.t:0 "Sakha Constitution"
yak.21.d:0 "There is only one thing Pavel Ksenofontov is absolutely sure to become the main achievement of the Sakha people - the Constitution, which will guarantee its independence, development and safety of cultural norms and traditions. The adoption of Consitution is an essential step in our nation-building process."
yak.21.a:0 "Glory to the Constitution!"

yak.22.t:0 "First Stage of Vseobuch"
yak.22.d:0 "Vseobuch, short for Universal Education , is the beginning of the rebirth of the Yakut people from the colonial period. The state will allocate money for the construction of schools and universities, so that young and adult Yakuts learn writing and mathematics and can move our society forward."
yak.22.a:0 "A Great Reform!"

yak.23.t:0 "New Foreign Partners"
yak.23.d:0 "Esablishing friendly relations with foreign nations is considered to be an important step in building our country. We shall send delegations to the Great Powers of the world and ask for their recognition of our state and, perhaps, even to open their Embassies in Yakutsk. Their recognition will show to the world that Sakha are strong and that our nation is respected."
yak.23.a:0 "Let's wait for their answers."

yak.24.t:0 "Yakutia Seeks For Recognition"
yak.24.d:0 "The nation of Yakuts have recently declared their independence and now they are seeking for international recognition of their state. While formally recognizing them will definetely worsen our relations with Russia, perhaps it is not so bad as it can seem?"
yak.24.a:0 "We will recognize them"
yak.24.b:0 "We will recognize them and open an Embassy there."
yak.24.c:0 "Who?.."

yak.25.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Recognizes Us"
yak.25.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Ministry of Foreign Affairs has agreed to recognize our independence. Now we shall send them a request to invest in our economy..."
yak.25.a:0 "A Great Victory for Sakha people!"

yak.26.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Will Open Embassy in Yakutsk"
yak.26.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recognized our independence and even agreed to open their embassy in Yakutsk. Now we shall send them a request to invest in our economy..."

yak.27.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused to Recognize Us!"
yak.27.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] have refused to recognize our state..."
yak.27.a:0 "Too bad..."

yak.28.t:0 "Invest in [FROM.GetName]?"
yak.28.d:0 "The Yakut government offered us to invest in their economy. They claim that gold has already been found in their area, and that they are now in search of the so-called 'blue clay', whatever that means."
yak.28.a:0 "A new Klondike?"
yak.28.b:0 "They are too far away"

yak.29.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Agreed to Invest!"
yak.29.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government agreed to invest in our economy, which is definetely great for us!"
yak.29.a:0 "A toast to our new friends!"

yak.30.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused to Invest!"
yak.30.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to invest in our economy, which is definetely not too great for us"
yak.30.a:0 "Well, at least they recognized us!"

yak.31.t:0 "The Reformation Period"
yak.31.d:0 "A complex of measures to improve our national-cultural development has been accepted by the president [ROOT.GetLeader] and soon they will be implemented. They include subsidies for local farmers and landowners, increased wages for workers and low taxes for citizens. It seems we are definetely closer and closer to become a true state."
yak.31.a:0 "Splendid!"

yak.32.t:0 "The Local Traditions Bill"
yak.32.d:0 "President [ROOT.GetLeader] has introduced a bill, that will legitimize our local customs and traditions, such as making Yhyakh, a national New Year celebration, a public holiday. Moreover, cattle breeding and fishing and hunting will become state-protected industries of national economy, which will guarantee high salary for the employees. As [ROOT.GetLeader] mentions, more customs and traditions will be legitimized as well, bringing prosperity to our nation and at the same time preserve our culture."
yak.32.a:0 "That's great!"

yak.33.t:0 "The Great Yytachy"
yak.33.d:0 "The very word 'President' is a concept imposed by Russia, which is not inherent in our people, which denies the very essence of Sakha. Our national leader is the person who will guide our country on the path to prosperity, so he should be given the appropriate name. From now on, our leader will call Yytachy, or The Guide. Faith in his great rule will help our people to cope with all the troubles, especially with the Russian colonizers."
yak.33.a:0 "Long Live Yytachy!"

yak.34.t:0 "The Fate of Evenks"
yak.34.d:0 "The people of the Evenks, or Tungus, who inhabit the lower reaches of the Lena River, although not completely under the jurisdiction of our state, have minorities on our territory. They are not our kindred people, coming from Mongolia and China, who profess a different faith and do not recognize us, the Sakha, as the legitimate rulers of the Sakha. And the position of the Great Guide is as follows. The Evenks must recognize the Sakha and recognize themselves as the Sakha. Otherwise, they have no place on the territory of our country. Let them leave here or become us. Nothing else is given."
yak.34.a:0 "Isn't it too cruel?"

yak.35.t:0 "Urung Aar Toyon"
yak.35.d:0 "The Aiys are the inhabitants of the Upper World, the progenitors of the Sakha people, the supreme patrons who gave our people independence. Thanks to their support, we managed to survive. Shamanism and the belief in Aiy, previously persecuted by Russian colonists, will now be free and institutionalized. Urung Aar Toyon, oh the Bright Creator Lord, bring glory and prosperity to our people, we, the flock of yours, pray to you!"
