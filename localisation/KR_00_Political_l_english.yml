### Subtype Descriptions ###
totalist_subtype_desc:0 "The term Totalism comes from the Totalist Charter, an agreement of cooperation between Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois and Benito Mussolini which outlined the main tenets of the ideology. Totalists abandon the federative element of Syndicalist state organization, stating that until world revolution has been achieved, revolutionary states need to be centralized and militarized to fight the remaining capitalist states. The extent to which society is transformed by Totalist regimes is significantly greater as well, often veering to totalitarian control of society and the construction of personality cults. Totalism is also often used to describe left-wing states which are not affiliated with Charter Totalism, but nevertheless display traits such as militarization, centralization, and totalitarian transformation of society."
syndicalist_subtype_desc:0 "Syndicalism is the leading left-wing revolutionary ideology whose rise to worldwide prominence began with the French revolution of 1919. Though Syndicalism is divided between various currents, some of them influenced by other ideologies such as Marxism and Anarchism, orthodox Syndicalism is based upon the works of the leaders of Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), codified in the Charter of Amiens of 1906, and considers Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to be its forerunners. Syndicalism is defined by the concepts of revolutionary spontaneity and direct action - the belief that the workers themselves, organized in labour unions, must combat capitalism, instead of relying upon an external agent such as a political party. The transformation of a capitalist society to a Syndicalist one must occur via a General Strike - a nationwide rejection of capitalism and a transfer of all means of production to labour unions. Syndicalist states are decentralized and federal, all industries are organized into syndicates, labour councils elected from these trade unions manage local governance, and central government is vested in a national congress of trade union representatives. The extent to which these tenets are implemented varies from country to country, however."
radical_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Radical Socialism is a catch-all phrase for the various Socialist, Communist and Anarchist ideologies that aren't directly associated with Syndicalism. Countries with this ideology operate with a socialist economy, usually accompanied with some kind of elected form of government; Their ultimate goal is to create a paradise for the working class, the details of which varies from movement to movement."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanise it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a plutocratic form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Social liberalism is a variation on mainstream Market liberalism, with the main difference being the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of their status."
market_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Market liberals see themselves as the mainstream liberal ideology. The main tenants of market liberalism are an unregulated free market and a democratic plutocratic political system. Market liberals believe that the freer the market the freer the people, and they will staunchly defend the political and economic rights of the individual."
social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Conservatism is a political ideology centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society in order and stable. Usually they promote a regulated market economy, but more liberal economic policies aren't unheard of."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian democracy is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partial democratic political system. Authoritarian democratic regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues and promote liberal-capitalist economies with limited state intervention. The aim of these regimes are to maintain national stability and provide the people both a popular and responsible government."
paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a monarch or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state controlled economy."
national_populist_subtype_desc:0 "Encompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy. Often espousing racial politics and violent rhetoric, National Populism is vehemently opposed by most other political parties."

Though Syndicalism is divided between various currents, some of them influenced by other ideologies such as Marxism and Anarchism, orthodox Syndicalism is based upon the works of the leaders of Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), codified in the Charter of Amiens of 1906, and considers Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to be its forerunners. Syndicalism is defined by the concepts of revolutionary spontaneity and direct action - the belief that the workers themselves, organized in labour unions, must combat capitalism, instead of relying upon an external agent such as a political party. The transformation of a capitalist society to a Syndicalist one must occur via a General Strike - a nationwide rejection of capitalism and a transfer of all means of production to labour unions. Syndicalist states are decentralized and federal, all industries are organized into syndicates, labour councils elected from these trade unions manage local governance, and central government is vested in a national congress of trade union representatives.
