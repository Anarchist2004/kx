### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ALI_SHIRE_DESC:0 "Having taken up the throne of the Warsangali Sultanate in 1897 after a protracted power struggle with his father Gerad Cali Shiire, he descends from a line of kings that has lasted almost 600 years in the Horn of Africa. While being nominally subservient to British interests, Maxamuud Cali Shiire's support of Abdullah Hassan, the Mad Mullah, was crucial in defeating Italy in Africa during the Weltkrieg. A savvy political navigator, Maxamuud has united the sultanates of Somalia under a federal monarchy under his nominal leadership; but can a man who declared war against his own father for power be trusted not to infringe on constitutional prerogatives?"
POLITICS_BARRE_DESC:0 "A Marehan Darod hailing from the Ogaden, Siad Barre has always been a competent and enthusiastic officer. He is uncommonly young and surprisingly vicious with his enemies, and his ideological inflexibility certainly comes from his training from members of the Muslim Socialist Committee. His vision of a Somalia united beyond clan bonds is one that is bound to find resistance at every level of Somali society."
POLITICS_HAAJI_MAHAMMAD_DESC:0 "Haaji Mohammed is the chief among a group of officers and intellectuals who defend the concept of a Greater Somalia above all else, and the unification of the people under one purpose. Despite his deep admiration for Abdullah Hassan, his group seeks completely detach Islam from the state, and such a measure is bound to unpopular at many levels of society."
POLITICS_JAMA_QUALIB_DESC:0 "Jama Abdullahi Qalib is a young liberal hailing from Hargresia. His faith on liberalism as the way to Somalia's future is admirable, but his readiness to work with foreigners has raised concerns on the populace, and so have his liberal ideas on the complete secularisation of the state"
POLITICS_ADEN_ADDE_DESC:0 "Born in 1909 in Beledweyne, Aden Abdullah remembers very well how it is to grow up under the thrall of Colonialism. His studies bring him closer and closer to Syndicalist ideologies, which he believes fit Somalia well; each clan is a trade union which works best autonomously, but most cooperate with its neighbours. He has been strongly influenced recently by French scholarship on matters of decentralised leadership, and hopes that he can ensure that Somalia's rough recent years can culminate in something good on the long run."
POLITICS_SHERMAKE_DESC:0 "A Majarteen from Mudog, Ali Shermarke is a competent young scholar, well versed in both Islamic, Federal and foreign laws. He wishes for a non-aligned and peaceful foreign policy, but his wishes may very well be overturned by the influences foreign powers exert now on Somalia."
POLITICS_BASHIR_YUSUF_SOM_DESC:0 "Hailing from the Osman Mahmoud clan of the Majarteen, Yusuf defends a more democratic and equal Somalia, even if he lacks the fervour for change that many of his colleagues do. His hopes are of a Somali Democratic Federation where the small clans and the city folk alike have their voices heard by the powers that be, and vows to fight poverty on rural areas of the nation."

### Ideas ###
SOM_iron_fist_of_warsangali:0 "Iron Fist of Warsangali"
SOM_iron_fist_of_warsangali_desc:0 "Warsangali is the leading state within Somalia, with its power base strong alongside deep German and Ottoman foreign ties dating to the Weltkrieg. While the capital is nominally in Mogadishu, much of the actual decision making is made in Las Khorey, and those who defy it are swiftly silenced."
SOM_gendarmerie_idea:0 "Soomaali Gandarmaariiga"
SOM_gendarmerie_idea_desc:0 "Based on the western gendarmeries, the Soomaali Gandarmaariiga ensure that the peace and safety of the Kingdom are not threatened or harmed by radicals or other sorts of troublemakers; Anarchists and other deviants beware!"
SOM_theclanassembly:0 "National Assembly of Clans"
SOM_theclanassembly_desc:0 "Each clan, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, now has the power to elect either one or two councilmen for the newly founded National Assembly of Clans, which serves as a lower house and is beneath the House of Lords."
SOM_xeer_checked:0 "Xeer In Check"
SOM_xeer_checked_desc:0 "Xeer, or customary law, has always been something of a legally grey area. However, we will restructure it in such a way that will allow each state and clan to regulate its own laws to a certain extent. However, locally created laws shall remain beneath Somali State Law and this will, therefore, end the contradictions and loopholes that had existed prior to reform."
SOM_HANGASH:0 "Hangash"
SOM_HANGASH_desc:0 "The newly founded Hay'adda Nabad Gal'yada Gaashaandhiga, or Hangash for short, is a Military Intelligence Unit designed to keep the balance of peace and harmony in the Kingdom of Somalia. The Boqor is now able to directly protect his subjects."
SOM_alles_blau:0 "Political Reforms Finished"
SOM_alles_blau_desc:0 "We may now reap the rewards of Ali Shire's reforms due to the united, peaceful, and harmonious state of the new, and reformed, Somalia."
SOM_cashcrops_idea:0 "Intensified Cashcrops"
SOM_cashcrops_idea_desc:0 "Because of the potential for famine, it is crucial that we store food reserves in order to best prepare ourselves, and the nation, for one. As it stands, our best bet would be to intensify the production of cash crops."
SOM_foodplease:0 "Food Shortages"
SOM_foodplease_desc:0 "The prosperity Somalia has experienced, with regards to urbanisation, foreign investment, and cultural renaissance, has not been without its downsides. The growing population, military, and the lack of less able farming hands means that food shortages, while somewhat uncommon, still factor into rural life in Somalia."
SOM_lesshunger:0 "Food Shortages Under Control"
SOM_lesshunger_desc:0 "Measures are now being taken in order to end famine in Somalia. We have begun by increasing the amount of arable land and have also begun purchasing foreign grain and foodstuffs."
SOM_nohunger:0 "No More Hunger"
SOM_nohunger_desc:0 "Whether it'd be urban or rural life, famine is now no longer a problem within Somalia. Finally, it seems as though our future is bright."
SOM_BM:0 "Black Monday Hits the Horn"
SOM_BM_desc:0 "Despite sparing us from much of its harsh effects, the ripples from Black Monday that had reached Somalia caused enough damage to wipe out our, admittedly, sparse industry as well as ruin our foreign investments, due to panic from investors. If we do not act fast, this could cause long term instability and lead to our downfall!"
SOM_prodeff:0 "Foreign Production Methods"
SOM_prodeff_desc:0 "Efforts are being made to reform and upgrade the few factories we possess in order to bring their standards up to date with Western ones."
SOM_great_again:0 "Pan Somali Ethos"
SOM_great_again_desc:0 "Pan-Somali ideas have long flourished within the circles of certain intellectuals and military officers living within our young nation. It is clear that the time to act has neared. We shall unite every Somali under our banner!"
SOM_osmanya:0 "Osmanya Alphabet Endorsed"
SOM_osmanya_desc:0 "Cusmaan Yuusuf Keenadiid, the Suldaan of Hobyo, is a well learned man who had designed a new script for the Somali language. While his alphabet has received widespread acclaim and is used within various universities, academies, and other institutes, it has not been used within daily Somali life. We shall endorse and expand upon it as to adopt it as the official script of the Somali language."
SOM_osmanya_2:0 "Osmanya Alphabet Endorsed"
SOM_osmanya_2_desc:0 "Cusmaan Yuusuf Keenadiid, the Suldaan of Hobyo, is a well learned man who had designed a new script for the Somali language. While his alphabet has received widespread acclaim and is used within various universities, academies, and other institutes, until recently, it was not used in daily Somali life. Thanks mostly to our efforts to encourage his alphabet and the offering of state-sponsored scholarships to prodigal students, the alphabet has begun to spread to the general populace."
SOM_university_rush_get_ballistics:0 "Officer and Soldier Academies"
SOM_university_rush_get_ballistics_desc:0 "Our military officers, both well known and unknown, now have greater education opportunities and new benefits available to them. This will both improve the quality of our NCOs while incentivising prospective officers to join the army."
SOM_militia_equip:0 "Well Equipped Militias"
SOM_militia_equip_desc:0 "Militias from constituent states are now equipped with the best gear and weapons available, designed and engineered both at home and abroad."
SOM_militia_fightbetter:0 "Well Trained Militias"
SOM_militia_fightbetter_desc:0 "Militias from constituent states now must train under a stricter regimen in order to better boost their organisation and co-ordination. We shall turn these men into proper soldiers, who will fight for the defence of the nation!"
SOM_cavriders:0 "Noble Horsemen"
SOM_cavriders_desc:0 "The upper echelons from our constituent states opt to fight on horseback, while adapting their techniques to better suit modern warfare, also updating their training methods and purchasing state of the art equipment."
SOM_moredoods:0 "Mass Recruiting"
SOM_moredoods_desc:0 "More and more men have joined their local militia to help defend Somalia; are you doing your part?"
SOM_planningsped:0 "Joint Planning Teams"
SOM_planningsped_desc:0 "While maintaining their nominal hierachies, CSMs now plan and operate as cohesive units."
SOM_militia_gottagofast:0 "Irregular Mobility"
SOM_militia_gottagofast_desc:0 "Our irregular forces have long been the backbone of our armed forces and we shall follow the footsteps of Hassan, whom the thwarted imperialists have taken to calling the Mad Mullah, and we will move swiftly within the lands we know, while striking hard within the ones we don't, in order to secure Somalia's future."

SOM_strenght_desc:0 "While the prosperity and development of Somalia have been astounding, Ali Shire had made sure to follow a 'let sleeping dogs lie' policy in terms of politics. Meanwhile, Somalis had rejoiced, basking in their freedom, unquestionably of the primacy of Las Khorey. However, news of administrative reform in Ethiopia and Egypt have convinced the Boqor that reform are, indeed, required."
SOM_gendarmerie_desc:0 "Maintaining order has been traditionally entrusted to local militias. The chief of each militia was entrusted with looking after the people. However, in order to better ensure peace and prosperity in the empire, we must outfit a force of men who are capable of containing riots, protests, revolts, and crimes. This new force will be known as the Soomaali Gandarmaariiga, based off of their western counterparts."
SOM_negotiate_desc:0 "The administrative model of the German Empire is an enlightened one and has pleased many of our Sheiks, Suldaans, and other rulers. The Boqor will rule as First Among Equals and every clan, no matter how small, will make up Somalia, each a federal unit."
SOM_unitedinwill_desc:0 "So long as the Somali nation and its people are united—in spirit, in determination, and in outlook—we can ensure that no goal is too big for us to conquer. In order to attain that ideal, however, we must first focus on resolving the problems within the empire..."
SOM_theassembly_desc:0 "Each clan, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, now has the power to elect either one or two councilmen for the newly founded National Assembly of Clans, which serves as a lower house and is beneath the House of Lords."
SOM_constituitionreform_desc:0 "A formalised constitution, which limits the powers of the states, territories, and of the union, will ensure that the pacts within the last few months are not but empty promises."
SOM_landofthefree_desc:0 "Since we've now completed laying down the framework for a democratic Somalia, and have finalised the rules with the new constitution, it's now up to the people to decide Somalia's future. Let the elections begin!"
SOM_justicetraditionsa_desc:0 "Xeer, or customary law, has always been something of a legally grey area. However, we will restructure it in such a way that will allow each state and clan to regulate its own laws to a certain extent. However, locally created laws shall remain beneath Somali State Law and this will, therefore, end the contradictions and loopholes that had existed prior to reform."
SOM_crackdownonclanism_desc:0 "Minor lords within Somalia have had the power to influence our decisions for far too long. Any notions of this facade of a federation must be dispelled, once and for all!"
SOM_unityistrenght_desc:0 "Somalia is a united nation, comprised of a singular group of people, under one sovereign. We had fought a lengthy and arduous battle to secure our future and we will not let petty infighting compromise that!"
SOM_formalizekingdomstructure_desc:0 "Somalia shall be, for all intents and purposes, a centralised kingdom in which the monarch has near absolute control. In order to bring about this new reality, however, a referendum shall take place to help determine the future of the kingdom."
SOM_tfwnoclans_desc:0 "As a formality, to quiet liberal dissent, elections shall be held. However, by utilising the work of propagandists, we can ensure that turnout remains at an absolute minimum. Let us remind the people who had fought alongside Hassan and his brave men, and who had cowered and licked the boots of the Italians."
SOM_forthegreatergood_desc:0 "Enemies about at every corner. Knifes in the dark, ready to strike at the elderly, fragile Boqor who gave so much of his life selflessly for his people. Traitors will be dealt with; swithfly and efficiently."
SOM_finishgovermentreforms_desc:0 "With the future of the nation safeguarded, tomorrow is brighter than ever. Now we must begin to plan for it..."
SOM_economicaldev_desc:0 "While our population has grown prosperous, we need to make sure that this prosperity is not something that will pass, by developing the economy into an industrial one. Our valued partners in the Porte and in Berlin will help us in this endeavour."
SOM_basicinfra_desc:0 "A nation as young as Somalia will always need investments linking provinces and regions; especially if we are to truly modernise."
#SOM_cashcrops_desc:0 "Hunger is still an issue within Somalia and food reserves are required in order to curb its effects. The best thing we can do is intensify cash crop production for some time." already defined above as an idea
SOM_endhunger_desc:0 "We must begin to take serious measures to help end famine in Somalia. Our first step will be to increase the amount of arable land within the empire and begin purchasing foreign grain and foodstuffs."
SOM_endhunger2_desc:0 "We have effectively ended the disaster that was famine. Now, hunger is no longer prevalent within Somalia, with both our rural and urban regions possessing enough food to feed their people. Our future seems bright!"
SOM_blackmonday_desc:0 "Despite not suffering as poorly from the effects of Black Monday as the nations within the German economic orbit, Somalia is still facing a major economic downturn. This cannot be allowed to happen; we must take action as soon as possible!"
SOM_warindustries_desc:0 "A harsh reality that we must come to terms with is the fact that war has drastically changed in the past decades. We can no longer hope to preserve Somalia with outdated equipment, utilising the same tactics and strategies our forefathers had used. Modern equipment, rigorous drilling, and updated planning are all essential for our survival."
SOM_foreignmethods_desc:0 "The few military factories within our possession must produce goods at maximum capacity and operate at full efficiency in order to give us a fighting chance against our imperialistic neighbours."
SOM_prepareforwar_desc:0 "War is coming to Somalia, whether we like it or not. Presuming otherwise is foolish, for the envious powers, residing within Addis Ababa, refuse to acknowledge the loss of Ogaden, a region they had never truly ruled over. Our preparations and planning must be extensive, swift, and efficient!"
SOM_lisencsingdeals_desc:0 "We require the help of foreign experts, foreign equipment, and foreign tactics if our military is to punch above its weight and meet the demanding requirements of modern war."
SOM_infra2thereinfraning_desc:0 "Connecting Somalia, from Barwaga to Zelia through the usage of railways and roads, is of the utmost importance. Our produce, our people, and our armies can no longer rely on dirt roads for transportation."
SOM_actualportsandairports_desc:0 "In the past, our ports had been sufficient for both our imports and exports. However, with our increased agricultural and industrial output, the pressure for public investment for the expansion and creation of new ports is now increasing, especially among our coastal lords."
SOM_pansomaliethos_desc:0 "Pan-Somali ideas have long flourished within the circles of certain intellectuals and military officers living within our young nation. It is clear that the time to act has neared. We shall unite every Somali under our banner!"
SOM_statefunded_national_revival_desc:0 "Our nation has had a glorious past and, ahead of it, has an even greater future. By sponsoring brilliant personalities and teachers who acknowledge this fact, and working hard to make sure our national pride is always high, we can truly make every citizen within our empire proud to be Somali."
SOM_put_down_the_lion_desc:0 "There are few things more pitiful than an old, sickly lion. Once a powerful empire, who had harboured the faithful in their hour of need, Abssinya is now little more than an amalgamation of scheming dukes who play dress-up and impersonate German officers. It's high time we put this once grand empire to rest."
SOM_civilianindustry_desc:0 "Our people are now able to afford new goods, imported from foreign nations. However, the cost of importing goods is far too expensive, especially for some luxury items. Perhaps it would be in our best interest to begin manufacturing these goods at home, instead of having our citizens purchase them from abroad?"
SOM_constructechnics_desc:0 "The reformation of any nation is never an easy job. While the task may be arduous, foreign expertise and skilled personnel will be be required if Somalia is to be dragged into the age of advancement."
SOM_consumergoods_desc:0 "Our consumer goods industry is severely limited due to low demand locally. By producing cheaper goods and exporting produce to nearby regions, we can ensure our industries will grow at an unprecedented rate."
SOM_politicalgoodwill_desc:0 "Much of the government still retains something of a provisional air, damaging its legitimacy and power. We must strive towards uniting and consolidating our alliances with both clan leaders and intellectuals within Somalia."
SOM_increasealphabetusage_desc:0 "Cusmaan Yuusuf Keenadiid, the Suldaan of Hobyo, is a well learned man who had designed a new script for the Somali language. While his alphabet has received widespread acclaim and is used within various universities, academies, and other institutes, it has not been used within daily Somali life. We shall endorse and expand upon it as to adopt it as the official script of the Somali language."
SOM_techslot_desc:0 "Well prepared and intelligent students will now be granted access to higher education, which will greatly assist our universities as they will now be bustling with active students and fresh ideas. Of course, this also means the state can benefit from these educated individuals to help advance itself."
SOM_techslot2_desc:0 "War is, oftentimes, a sporadic event which means we must plan and prepare for every single scenario. While our generals receive constant tweaks and updates to their battle plans, so must our engineers and planners who can help us best ready ourselves for any oncoming war."
SOM_higherlearning_desc:0 "Higher education within Somalia is still lacking, and if our nation is to be taken seriously among the global academia we must begin heavy investments, the opening of more universities outside of Mogadishu, the education and re-education of our militia officers, and the guarantee of every region within the nation possessing a higher learning institution."
SOM_royalarmy_desc:0 "Reforming the army is requires more than simply appointing new men to new positions. A new mentality is required alongside modernised equipment. The priorities and duties of a modern military force is tough in and of itself."
SOM_reformsreorgan_desc:0 "The reformation of any army is always easier said than done. The first obstacle we face is where to focus our efforts. In addition, the question of centralising the army or allowing it to retain it a degree of autonomy is vital to its modernisation. Of course, such a decision would have political consequences, no matter what we choose, which is why further efforts must be preceded by sweeping political reforms."
SOM_clanmilitiaarmament_desc:0 "Every constituent state will now require its own militia which will fall under our centralised control. The clans will be granted weapons in exchange for providing us with manpower."
SOM_isthatamiltiagungiseewithabursa_desc:0 "While an army compromised of militiamen may be grand in size, it will fail against trained foes if it is untrained. Ensuring that our soldiers are trained using modern doctrines and efficient regimens is crucial."
SOM_clancavreg_desc:0 "It has been known that, for centuries, the nobles living within Somalia have been proficient in the art of horsemanship. Providing these modern day knights with a purpose to defend Somalia is crucial if we are to better protect our nation."
SOM_hobyoyards_desc:0 "Alongside his studies, the Sultan of Hobyo has also focused his attention on the sea and has made grand investments into the shipyards within the area. He has effectively bestowed upon Hobyo one of the largest and most up to date naval bases within Somalia. More is planned, of course, but in order to advance further the Sultan requires federal assistance."
SOM_logisticsformilitoas_desc:0 "Supplying an army that is so decentralised as ours is no easy task. Logistical routes must be found and mapped out, and we must ensure that the supplies sent to our troops will reach their destination safely. Thankfully, we've men qualified for the task."
SOM_jointplanningteams_desc:0 "We will gather up the best men within Somalia and, through the use of centralised joint planning teams, shall ensure that the states will strike together as one cohesive unit. We must defend the motherland!"
SOM_mobilization_effort_desc:0 "Somali men, heed the call for your clan, your family, and your country need you! Come to the nearest recruiting station to sign up to fight and, together with your brothers, work hard to ensure that Somalia shall never again fall under the yoke of imperialism!"
SOM_magarteenartillery_desc:0 "The Sultan of Majarteen, with his infinite wisdom, knew that our safety was transitory and, thus, had invested much into the creation of an armoury which is able to produce the finest modern artillery. Based off of Turkish designs, and funded through the Sultan's own pocket, we cannot let this opportunity go to waste. Let us all join forces to defend Somalia!"
SOM_moblity_desc:0 "Investing in advanced technology, such as tanks and motorised infantry, is important in order to keep up with the current state of warfare. We shall defend our homeland through the use of speed, outmanoeuvring our enemies and attaining victory!"
SOM_advanced_naval_engagements_desc:0 "By utilising naval doctrine alongside military doctrine and making sure that the two can work in lockstep with one another, we can ensure that our army can handle any threat, whether it'd be at sea or on land."
SOM_onkod_warfare_desc:0 "Somalia's militia has long been our backbone and our pride. By following the steps of Hassan, whom the defeated imperialists call the Mad Mullah, we will move swiftly through lands we know and strike forcefully through the land we don't. We must secure Somalia's future through any means necessary."
SOM_unfiedarmy_desc:0 "The army is an invaluable part of the state and it shall maintain order, face continual modernisation, and be administered in a centralised fashion, following the lead of the European nations."
SOM_factory_desc:0 "Ensuring that we possess enough factories to properly supply a modern military is crucial to Somalia's survival. Such an effort will demand much of our attention and resources, however."
SOM_planning_strategically_desc:0 "Our officers, eager to educate themselves in the ways of modern war, will have the aid of foreign experts at their disposal. This will ensure that the defeat of Somalia's enemies will be imminent, both on a tactical and strategic level."
SOM_tankbuy_desc:0 "Tanks are costly, hard to produce, and infinitely harder to properly maintain. However, on the off chance that we can produce them, they will be an invaluable asset in any future wars and will give us a definite advantage over our enemies."
SOM_factory2_desc:0 "Our factories must operate at full industrial capacity, producing military goods to better supply and equip our army. After all, supply is an extremely crucial factor of any sort of warfare and can determine the outcome of any war or, on a smaller scale, any battle."
SOM_equipment_desc:0 "In order to convince our men that the army has truly undergone a reformation, we must provide them with new boots, new guns, and better rations in order to provide evidence of the effectiveness of our reforms."
SOM_modern_guns_desc:0 "Artillery pieces and handguns within our possession are relics from the Weltkrieg era, some even dating back to an age far before the war itself. New equipment is required to modernise the armed forces."
SOM_support_eq_desc:0 "We shall turn our focus to the production of support equipment and introduce logistical support training in order to better modernise our armed forces."
SOM_thatsthepointsarge_desc:0 "The cream of the crop, men who are handpicked from Las Khorey by the Sultan himself, shall comprise the elite forces of Somalia. These men possess the most loyalty out of all of our subjects and have lent their full support to Somalia and the Boqor, above all else."
SOM_military_doctrine_effort_desc:0 "War is raging worldwide, with countries pit against one another in a desperate struggle for victory. In order to best prepare for this scenario, we must remain aware of the tactical and strategic developments during these times and find ways to exploit them in order to defend the motherland."
SOM_support_companies_desc:0 "Support companies will most certainly be crucial to future war efforts and are a must need for any modern fighting force. In order to establish them, we will require the support and knowledge of foreign officers to help train our men. Of course, everything, including hiring foreign officers, has a price."
SOM_inthenavy_desc:0 "Somalia stands at a crucial point in its history and its strategic location cannot be brushed aside. If we manage to build up and organise a powerful navy and a proper air force, we may find ourselves in control of the world's busiest shipping lane."
SOM_royalnavy_desc:0 "Currently, our warships are little more than outdated Weltkrieg era ships, sold to us by the great powers. If we are to wrest control of the high seas, we must begin the reformation of the Royal Navy. In order to do so, we require new ships, skilled sailors, and competent officers."
SOM_buildup_desc:0 "We will begin a large scale naval buildup programme in order to help aid us in creating more ships. While this will prove to be a costly endeavour, hopefully it will grant us much reward in the near future."

A young general and Pan-Somali Left-Nationalist with a penchant for corruption and authoritarian militarism, Barre is expected to drive Somalia and the rest of the Horn towards Marxist-inspired Communism and Pan-Somali Nationalism as he tries to sate his own lust for power and wealth along the way while attempting to figure out what to do with Somalia’s traditionally tribal society."

With Barre now in power, his party is free to pursue just that, and they shall do so without impunity. The archaic Somali society and culture shall be forged into a modern Socialist state, supported by Marxist teachings, a latinized script and writing system, a modernized language, a new modernist culture, and Somali nationalism to create a new and wholly modernized vision of Somali socioeconomics and day-to-day life under Barre’s one-party state."

They are the vehicle that shall drive the Somali Proletariat towards greatness, equality, and prosperity, and so their will must be followed at all times while their numbers must ever-expand until all within the state are a member of the Vanguard. Party members will receive special benefits and privileges as incentives while they help guide wider Somali society towards the perfectionist gaia that Scientific Socialism can bring, and all Somali proletariat shall eventually cry out with glee as they are sheparded towards Marxist majesty under Barre and the one-party state apparatus of the SRSP."

Though their original movement died out in 1920, we honor their spirit and ideas in the platform of the GSL.

### Events ###

som.1.t:0 "United We Stand!"
som.1.d:0 "The multiple states of Somalia were preyed upon by colonists and, in the eyes of the international community, we were seen as weak. We had fallen, divided, with brother against brother. However, after Abdullah Hassan's astounding victories over the Italians during the Weltkrieg, Italy had completely withdrawn from Somalia and the Sultan of Warsangali had, in all but name, slipped from British control as they were preoccupied with fighting the Germans. The Peace with Honour, officially concluding the Weltkrieg, paradoxically made Somalia free while remaining a protectorate of Britain due to Ali Shire's treaties. This status-quo, which had benefitted both parties, did not last for long, however, as the British Empire had collapsed. In a moment of what some may call opportunism, Warsangali's forces seized what was left of British Somaliland and the lords allied to him proclaimed him Bogor, or emperor, of Somalia. However, he sought to style himself as King of Somalia in the West as a way to court the monarchs of the Central Powers while recognising the ultimate authority of the Caliph. Prosperity followed for Somalia, with our fields growing rich and our cities larger. In addition, we'd managed to secure control over Ogaden in spite of the opposition from Ethiopia. Our roads, books, and universities are all symptoms of this event which has been dubbed the Somali Renaissance, but great danger may lie ahead for the wise understand that good times cannot be maintained indefinitely. Halie Selassie eyes our great nation enviously and Mittelafrika's new Statthalter remains diplomatically unapproachable. Whatever the future may hold, we can sit content with the fact that we have seized every possible opportunity presented to us and, together as one, leading Somalia to a better and brighter future."

Barre has long been a Leftist inspired by Marx, and has devoted himself for years to Marxist causes, the ideas of Lenin, and the ideology of Communism at large, adamantly denying the new wave of Syndicalism in disgust. Setting up the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party as a vanguard organization, he has longed to turn Somalia over to the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, this push has put him at odds with the tribes and familial clans that have long dominated Somali society. Usually an opponent to these forces, Barre has increasingly yielded to or sided with tribalist internets as of late, spitting in the face of his Marxist roots in order to earn the loyalty of Somalia’s traditionalist masses and along with them, the Pan-Somalian majority. \n\nJustifying this shift by stating that his old Marxist tendencies may become corrupt with Syndicalist Liberalism, Barre may fully jump ship from his Leninist foundation. Further fueling this shift is Barre’s own greed and blind ambition, revealing kleptocratic and other selfish tendencies that the Red General struggles to continue to hide. All in all, Siad Barre is a diverse revolutionary now torn in several directions, and only he can choose which final path he shall take."

He could either maintain a full grasp on politics, and stop the reforms short of allowing any form of real democracy, effectively puppeting the entire government from top to bottom under Husseen, or he could allow some minor democratic reform to come into play, creating a fusion of Pan-Somali Nationalism, Islamic Republicanism, and Conservative Democracy to benefit all true and faithful sons of Somalia.

However, despite the Internationale aiding in Barre’s initial rise, they have been so far reluctant to accept his ideas on the international stage. If Barre is to win the full support of Paris and London, he will likely have to fully bend to the ideas of Western Syndicalism, in one form or another. Is altering the Revolution and the fate of Somalia as a whole worth the support of these Western giants?"
