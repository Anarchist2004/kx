POLITICS_WILLIAM_TUBMAN_FALLOUT_DESC:0 "Few men in Human history have had the weight of an entire civilization on their shoulders, and fewer still have had the ability to do anything to stop the inevitable collapse that comes for every empire, but William Tubman is no mere man - at least, not anymore. \n\nBorn long before this metaversal mess in another realm, William Vacanarat Shadrach Tubman served as President of Liberia, bringing liberty to his people on the Windward Coast as the Cold War and later Resource Wars began to tear the world apart. Hearing rumors of doomsday-devices being constructed by the world’s Superpowers and ever cautious of the ever-escalating war, President Tubman began to prepare for the worst. Amassing resources and technologies from all over the globe through his far-reaching connections, President Tubman plotted to save what he could of humanity as the clock ticked ever faster towards midnight. Creating networks of bunkers protected by a nation-spanning missile-defense system and powered by nuclear reactors, President Tubman labored hard to save his people, but as the ravages of stress, time, age, and radiation began to take effect on him, something drastic had to be done. Utilizing temperamental and experimental technology stolen from the American Southwest, this heroic madman transferred his own consciousness to a system of computers, digitizing himself and becoming bodiless but immortal. With endless time to prepare, Tubman was able to turn Liberia into a paradisiacal fortress before all hell let loose. \n\nOnce the final bell tolled and the bombs finally fell, nearly all life on Earth was eradicated within moments, and though even the mightiest nations fell before the sword, our Liberia stood strong! Due to President Tubman’s preparations, we were saved from this hellfire apocalypse, hidden away under vast underground vaults and sheltered behind the most sophisticated defense system ever built. In the new wasteland, Liberia prospered for many decades, but now all that has changed. After being transferred through time and space by God knows what, this ‘Mr. Tubman’ as his AI form calls himself is unsure of what to make of this new reality, but is still as hell-bent as ever to secure liberty for Liberia and its people at all cost."

### Events ###
april.1.t:0 "The APCC Metaversal Manipulator Malfunctions!"
april.1.d:0 "Breaking news! A malfunction in the American Preservation and Colonization Committee's experimental time-tampering technology has resulted in a catastrophic failure of the primary time-circuits, as well as the flux capacitor and the various chrono-triggers. This dangerous and reality-warping calamity has caused two previously separate universes within the wider Multiverse to slam together, fusing into a weird centaur-like mix of the two realities. With the fallout of such an event being as deadly as it is reality-changing, few are prepared for the strange world that now lies before us. Quickly, we must get our bearings in this outlandish and seemingly irradiated wasteland."
april.1.a:0 "Did we just set the world on fire?"

april_lib.2.t:0 "Mr. Tubman Arrives"
april_lib.2.d:0 "Coming through the interdimensional rift that caused this whole chronological calamity, Mr. Tubman - the immortal AI form of President William Tubman who transferred his brain into a series of computers in order to live forever and save Liberia - has begun to take over the apparatus of state. With an army of Securitron robots and endless other advanced technologies at his disposal, all have been powerless to stop him as he completely takes control of Liberia. Redubbing the nation ‘New Monrovia’, this rogue but ingenious AI has one directive - to save Liberia and to bring liberty to its people at all costs. Immortal and unmatchable, Mr. Tubman shall set the nation free and guide us towards utopia under his genius leadership and foresight."
april_lib.2.a:0 "If you want to see the fate of democracies, look out the windows."

april_lib.3.t:0 "Picking the Muscle"
april_lib.3.d:0 "Upon the orders of Mr. Tubman, we have moved to broker an alliance with one of the dominant groups in New Monrovia. Among the many gangs, cliques, tribes, and other conglomerates, a few stand supreme. \n\nThe first and most obvious choice would be to align with the Firestone Company. Not only did they help Mr. Tubman source the materials and technologies needed to save New Monrovia and transfer himself to immortality, for they also build and maintain his vast army of Securitrons. The second and still likely option is to align with the Masons, composed of Mr. Tubman’s loyalists and close associates. They have their strengths as the ones who control the day to day operations of the Liberian government as Mr. Tubman deals with greater tasks, while also controlling the cities of New Monrovia, but there are rumors that they seek to one day usurp Tubman’s rule. \n\nThe third choice would be to align with the tribal secret society based in the Hinterlands called the Poro. The Poro, contrary to the tribal nature of its members, is highly organized as well as incredibly efficient and violent. They run all sorts of lucrative scams, sinful business, and even hire themselves out as hired guns, and being the largest group by far they have the numbers to back it up. Finally, the strange Leopard Society stands in the shadows. A secret society like the Masons and the Poro, the Leopard Society and their smaller partner gang the Crocodile Society are known cannibals and practitioners of witchcraft and sorcery, which has only been enhanced by the radiation of our olh homeland pre-Rift. Brutally effective assassins, specialists, and esoterics, these madmen would be perfect to form a special forces corp if they could be tamed."
