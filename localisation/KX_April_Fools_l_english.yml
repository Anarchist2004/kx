### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_WILLIAM_TUBMAN_FALLOUT_DESC:0 "Few men in Human history have had the weight of an entire civilization on their shoulders, and fewer still have had the ability to do anything to stop the inevitable collapse that comes for every empire, but William Tubman is no mere man - at least, not anymore. \n\nBorn long before this metaversal mess in another realm, William Vacanarat Shadrach Tubman served as President of Liberia, bringing liberty to his people on the Windward Coast as the Cold War and later Resource Wars began to tear the world apart. Hearing rumors of doomsday-devices being constructed by the world’s Superpowers and ever cautious of the ever-escalating war, President Tubman began to prepare for the worst. Amassing resources and technologies from all over the globe through his far-reaching connections, President Tubman plotted to save what he could of humanity as the clock ticked ever faster towards midnight. Creating networks of bunkers protected by a nation-spanning missile-defense system and powered by nuclear reactors, President Tubman labored hard to save his people, but as the ravages of stress, time, age, and radiation began to take effect on him, something drastic had to be done. Utilizing temperamental and experimental technology stolen from the American Southwest, this heroic madman transferred his own consciousness to a system of computers, digitizing himself and becoming bodiless but immortal. With endless time to prepare, Tubman was able to turn Liberia into a paradisiacal fortress before all hell let loose. \n\nOnce the final bell tolled and the bombs finally fell, nearly all life on Earth was eradicated within moments, and though even the mightiest nations fell before the sword, our Liberia stood strong! Due to President Tubman’s preparations, we were saved from this hellfire apocalypse, hidden away under vast underground vaults and sheltered behind the most sophisticated defense system ever built. In the new wasteland, Liberia prospered for many decades, but now all that has changed. After being transferred through time and space by God knows what, this ‘Mr. Tubman’ as his AI form calls himself is unsure of what to make of this new reality, but is still as hell-bent as ever to secure liberty for Liberia and its people at all cost."
POLITICS_ZAPATA_AI_DESC:0 "Emiliano Zapata - the fourth and final son of Tlaloc - has taken to the ideals of his human counterpart fiercely: seeking to eradicate inequality and poverty §RSYSTEM ERROR, Rebooting...§!\nEmiliano Zapata, freedom fighter of the Mexican Revolution, was a leading figure in the conflict. He fought against the corrupt regime of Porfirio Díaz until he was killed in an ambush in April 1919. After his death, Zapatista generals aligned with §RSYSTEM ERROR, Rebooting...§!\nFollowing the Mexican Revolution and after three back-to-back PLM presidents, Zapata broke their political monopoly and achieved victory in Mexico's 1932 Presidential election with his PNA. Since taking office, he has promoted the development of Mexico's collective farms, 'Ejidos', and through economic incentives and with Mexican oil on offer, has fostered close diplomatic ties with the Third Internationale. However, his vaguely Socialist stances and deeply Socialist allies have angered many §RSYSTEM ERROR, Rebooting...§!\nEmiliano Zapata is the ultimate culmination of humanity’s hubris. A god of saturnite, plasma and human ingenuity built for only one purpose: the complete destruction of Capitalism as a conceptual idea. Zapata will bring about his agrarian-socialist utopia, even if he has to kill every last capitalist in the wasteland to do it."

april.1.d:0 "Breaking news! A malfunction in the American Preservation and Colonization Committee's experimental time-tampering technology has resulted in a catastrophic failure of the primary time-circuits, as well as the flux capacitor and the various chrono-triggers. This dangerous and reality-warping calamity has caused two previously separate universes within the wider Multiverse to slam together, fusing into a weird centaur-like mix of the two realities. With the fallout of such an event being as deadly as it is reality-changing, few are prepared for the strange world that now lies before us. Quickly, we must get our bearings in this outlandish and seemingly irradiated wasteland."

april_lib.2.t:0 "Mr. Tubman Arrives"
april_lib.2.d:0 "Coming through the interdimensional rift that caused this whole chronological calamity, Mr. Tubman - the immortal AI form of President William Tubman who transferred his brain into a series of computers in order to live forever and save Liberia - has begun to take over the apparatus of state. With an army of Securitron robots and endless other advanced technologies at his disposal, all have been powerless to stop him as he completely takes control of Liberia. Redubbing the nation ‘New Monrovia’, this rogue but ingenious AI has one directive - to save Liberia and to bring liberty to its people at all costs. Immortal and unmatchable, Mr. Tubman shall set the nation free and guide us towards utopia under his genius leadership and foresight."

april_lib.3.t:0 "Picking the Muscle"
april_lib.3.d:0 "Upon the orders of Mr. Tubman, we have moved to broker an alliance with one of the dominant groups in New Monrovia. Among the many gangs, cliques, tribes, and other conglomerates, a few stand supreme. \n\nThe first and most obvious choice would be to align with the Firestone Company. Not only did they help Mr. Tubman source the materials and technologies needed to save New Monrovia and transfer himself to immortality, for they also build and maintain his vast army of Securitrons. The second and still likely option is to align with the Masons, composed of Mr. Tubman’s loyalists and close associates. They have their strengths as the ones who control the day to day operations of the Liberian government as Mr. Tubman deals with greater tasks, while also controlling the cities of New Monrovia, but there are rumors that they seek to one day usurp Tubman’s rule. \n\nThe third choice would be to align with the tribal secret society based in the Hinterlands called the Poro. The Poro, contrary to the tribal nature of its members, is highly organized as well as incredibly efficient and violent. They run all sorts of lucrative scams, sinful business, and even hire themselves out as hired guns, and being the largest group by far they have the numbers to back it up. Finally, the strange Leopard Society stands in the shadows. A secret society like the Masons and the Poro, the Leopard Society and their smaller partner gang the Crocodile Society are known cannibals and practitioners of witchcraft and sorcery, which has only been enhanced by the radiation of our olh homeland pre-Rift. Brutally effective assassins, specialists, and esoterics, these madmen would be perfect to form a special forces corp if they could be tamed."

Seeking asylum and military experts themselves, General Henry Arnold has brokered an alliance with these fellow Californians. The new Sacramento Chapter shall rise, with General Arnold being made an honorary Paladin to maintain good will, and together with these new allies, we shall win this dreadful war and preserve humanity and technology here on the West Coast."

april_psa.2.t:0 "On the Question of Our Government"
april_psa.2.d:0 "Even though we share the same goals and many of the same core beliefs, friction and tension has begun to build between ourselves and our new futuristic allies. The main issue arises from a difference in opinion in how the war should be conducted and how the nation should be run. The Brotherhood of Steel advocates that technology, knowledge, and humanity’s achievements must be preserved at all costs, even if that would compromise our duty to protest the lives of the people in our state. However, General Arnold finds this idea abhorrent, and though he supports the Brotherhood’s dedication to preserving civilization and its accomplishments, he still prioritizes the lives and well-being of the innocent. With tensions flarings, this power struggle must come to an end quickly, but only one group can truly call the shots."

The Scribes are the brainiacs of our operation, chronicling and restoring the advanced technology we recover while also serving as strategists, teachers, administrators, and more. Meanwhile, the Paladins are the armored fist of the Brotherhood, being our main military force and chief officers within our military hierarchy. Nearly unkillable in their armor, especially when up against the outdated weapons of this timeline, these modern knights in shining Power Armor lay waste to our many foes as they swear to protect our Chapter and further scout for new technologies to recover. Though both shall always be a key component to our operations, we only have the resources to favor one, so should we favor the Scribes or the Paladins?"

Landing near Urga and seizing the unprepared city, Mongolia has quickly begun to fall under our control. However, with this land’s Khan, who goes by the strange name of Ungern, on his way back to the city, Papa Khan prepared his forces to hold our new home at all costs. \n\nIn a battle of horses and scrap-bikes, archers and gunners, members of both khanate fell before the steel and lead in droves before the bloody nightmare finally ended. Standing atop a pile of bodies from both dimensions, Papa Khan and Ungern could be seen dueling in a fierce melee. However, with one misstep on an outcropping of hacked arms and flesh, Ungern lost his footing and was quickly beheaded by the opportunistic Papa Khan. Raising the head of the false khan high above for all to see, Ungern’s surviving men dropped to their knees and swore fealty to the true khan. Now, with this new khanate under his control, we Great Khans finally have the foundations needed to build the empire we have long dreamed of.

Armed with only small daggers and their bare-hands, the two titans went at it like demi-gods fighting for the fate of the mortal world. However, only one could come out on top, so who shall win this deadly and final duel?"

Though most would have predicted that such a move would have killed Tlaloc, it would seem that the opposite has become true, for the rapid decay that was causing Tlaloc's demise in the other world has now been entirely stopped, perhaps forever! With Tlaloc now occupying all of southern Mexico, the two AIs are now locked in a Mexican Standoff of their own, with the destiny of all of Central American and perhaps the world hanging in the balance."

He has endured to make all around him perfect like he is in electronic utopia, all for the Revolution. However, even a god needs help sometimes, and so Zapata deigned to do what his own father Tlaloc had done before him. Creating a new subroutine from his own processing power, he would create a copy of his favored meat puppet, but not out of the fetid and crude biomass that encumbered the real subject. This chosen specimen - the beacon of Totalism in the world Oswald Mosley - shall be saved from the unstoppable withering that befalls all lesser and base organic creatures, with his mind copied and transferred into a new temple of circuity and chrome. From the machine is immortal, and so shall rise Oswald - Zapata’s own son and his new right-hand ‘man’ aiding him in his destiny and duty to bring the Revolution to all!"

However, longing for companionship or perhaps simply just experimenting as he has always done, Tlaloc was not ready to end the tale of Zapata. Once again diverting some of his own processing power, Tlaloc created a new Zapata, but one free of the malformed code and endless bugs that plague the last one. Instead, this new Zapata was based off of this new Timeline's version of Zapata - the one who led the Mexican Revolution to glorious victory and who brought the Revolution to Tlaloc’s new people. Reborn, remade, and entirely reprogrammed, this new Zapata would serve his father dutifully and loyally forever, unlike that last failure."
