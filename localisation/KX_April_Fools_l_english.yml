POLITICS_WILLIAM_TUBMAN_FALLOUT_DESC:0 "Few men in Human history have had the weight of an entire civilization on their shoulders, and fewer still have had the ability to do anything to stop the inevitable collapse that comes for every empire, but William Tubman is no mere man - at least, not anymore. \n\nBorn long before this metaversal mess in another realm, William Vacanarat Shadrach Tubman served as President of Liberia, bringing liberty to his people on the Windward Coast as the Cold War and later Resource Wars began to tear the world apart. Hearing rumors of doomsday-devices being constructed by the world’s Superpowers and ever cautious of the ever-escalating war, President Tubman began to prepare for the worst. Amassing resources and technologies from all over the globe through his far-reaching connections, President Tubman plotted to save what he could of humanity as the clock ticked ever faster towards midnight. Creating networks of bunkers protected by a nation-spanning missile-defense system and powered by nuclear reactors, President Tubman labored hard to save his people, but as the ravages of stress, time, age, and radiation began to take effect on him, something drastic had to be done. Utilizing temperamental and experimental technology stolen from the American Southwest, this heroic madman transferred his own consciousness to a system of computers, digitizing himself and becoming bodiless but immortal. With endless time to prepare, Tubman was able to turn Liberia into a paradisiacal fortress before all hell let loose. \n\nOnce the final bell tolled and the bombs finally fell, nearly all life on Earth was eradicated within moments, and though even the mightiest nations fell before the sword, our Liberia stood strong! Due to President Tubman’s preparations, we were saved from this hellfire apocalypse, hidden away under vast underground vaults and sheltered behind the most sophisticated defense system ever built. In the new wasteland, Liberia prospered for many decades, but now all that has changed. After being transferred through time and space by God knows what, this ‘Mr. Tubman’ as his AI form calls himself is unsure of what to make of this new reality, but is still as hell-bent as ever to secure liberty for Liberia and its people at all cost."
POLITICS_ZAPATA_AI_DESC:0 "Emiliano Zapata - the fourth and final son of Tlaloc - has taken to the ideals of his human counterpart fiercely: seeking to eradicate inequality and poverty §RSYSTEM ERROR, Rebooting...§!\nEmiliano Zapata, freedom fighter of the Mexican Revolution, was a leading figure in the conflict. He fought against the corrupt regime of Porfirio Díaz until he was killed in an ambush in April 1919. After his death, Zapatista generals aligned with §RSYSTEM ERROR, Rebooting...§!\nFollowing the Mexican Revolution and after three back-to-back PLM presidents, Zapata broke their political monopoly and achieved victory in Mexico's 1932 Presidential election with his PNA. Since taking office, he has promoted the development of Mexico's collective farms, 'Ejidos', and through economic incentives and with Mexican oil on offer, has fostered close diplomatic ties with the Third Internationale. However, his vaguely Socialist stances and deeply Socialist allies have angered many §RSYSTEM ERROR, Rebooting...§!\nEmiliano Zapata is the ultimate culmination of humanity’s hubris. A god of saturnite, plasma and human ingenuity built for only one purpose: the complete destruction of Capitalism as a conceptual idea. Zapata will bring about his agrarian-socialist utopia, even if he has to kill every last capitalist in the wasteland to do it."

This can only end one way, Tlaloc brought Zapata into this world, or at least some version of it, and he will be the one to take him out of it"

april.1.t:0 "The APCC Metaversal Manipulator Malfunctions!"
april.1.d:0 "Breaking news! A malfunction in the American Preservation and Colonization Committee's experimental time-tampering technology has resulted in a catastrophic failure of the primary time-circuits, as well as the flux capacitor and the various chrono-triggers. This dangerous and reality-warping calamity has caused two previously separate universes within the wider Multiverse to slam together, fusing into a weird centaur-like mix of the two realities. With the fallout of such an event being as deadly as it is reality-changing, few are prepared for the strange world that now lies before us. Quickly, we must get our bearings in this outlandish and seemingly irradiated wasteland."
april.1.a:0 "Did we just set the world on fire?"

april_lib.2.t:0 "Mr. Tubman Arrives"
april_lib.2.d:0 "Coming through the interdimensional rift that caused this whole chronological calamity, Mr. Tubman - the immortal AI form of President William Tubman who transferred his brain into a series of computers in order to live forever and save Liberia - has begun to take over the apparatus of state. With an army of Securitron robots and endless other advanced technologies at his disposal, all have been powerless to stop him as he completely takes control of Liberia. Redubbing the nation ‘New Monrovia’, this rogue but ingenious AI has one directive - to save Liberia and to bring liberty to its people at all costs. Immortal and unmatchable, Mr. Tubman shall set the nation free and guide us towards utopia under his genius leadership and foresight."
april_lib.2.a:0 "If you want to see the fate of democracies, look out the windows."

april_lib.3.t:0 "Picking the Muscle"
april_lib.3.d:0 "Upon the orders of Mr. Tubman, we have moved to broker an alliance with one of the dominant groups in New Monrovia. Among the many gangs, cliques, tribes, and other conglomerates, a few stand supreme. \n\nThe first and most obvious choice would be to align with the Firestone Company. Not only did they help Mr. Tubman source the materials and technologies needed to save New Monrovia and transfer himself to immortality, for they also build and maintain his vast army of Securitrons. The second and still likely option is to align with the Masons, composed of Mr. Tubman’s loyalists and close associates. They have their strengths as the ones who control the day to day operations of the Liberian government as Mr. Tubman deals with greater tasks, while also controlling the cities of New Monrovia, but there are rumors that they seek to one day usurp Tubman’s rule. \n\nThe third choice would be to align with the tribal secret society based in the Hinterlands called the Poro. The Poro, contrary to the tribal nature of its members, is highly organized as well as incredibly efficient and violent. They run all sorts of lucrative scams, sinful business, and even hire themselves out as hired guns, and being the largest group by far they have the numbers to back it up. Finally, the strange Leopard Society stands in the shadows. A secret society like the Masons and the Poro, the Leopard Society and their smaller partner gang the Crocodile Society are known cannibals and practitioners of witchcraft and sorcery, which has only been enhanced by the radiation of our olh homeland pre-Rift. Brutally effective assassins, specialists, and esoterics, these madmen would be perfect to form a special forces corp if they could be tamed."
april_lib.3.a:0 "Rely on Firestone."
april_lib.3.b:0 "Stick with the Masons."
april_lib.3.c:0 "Drift towards the Poro."

april_mon.1.d:0 "Surviving the chronological calamity that slammed these two universes together, our Great Khans, in some weird twist of fate, landed upon the great Eastern Steppe - the home of the original Khans. Landing near Urga and seizing the unprepared city, Mongolia has quickly begun to fall under our control. However, with this land’s Khan, who goes by the strange name of Ungern, on his way back to the city, Papa Khan prepared his forces to hold our new home at all costs. \n\nIn a battle of horses and scrap-bikes, archers and gunners, members of both khanate fell before the steel and lead in droves before the bloody nightmare finally ended. Standing atop a pile of bodies from both dimensions, Papa Khan and Ungern could be seen dueling in a fierce melee. However, with one misstep on an outcropping of hacked arms and flesh, Ungern lost his footing and was quickly beheaded by the opportunistic Papa Khan. Raising the head of the false khan high above for all to see, Ungern’s surviving men dropped to their knees and swore fealty to the true khan. Now, with this new khanate under his control, we Great Khans finally have the foundations needed to build the empire we have long dreamed of. Now, onwards to destiny as we march to make all under the Great Sky ours!"

april_mon.2.d:0 "With the rivalry between them finally coming to a head, Papa Khan challenged Regis to a duel to the death in order to see who would survive to lead the Great Khans. Accepting without hesitation, the idealistic reformer Regis followed the mad bandit king Papa Khan into the thunderdome in which the brawl would be held - a massive metal cage surrounded with coliseum seating in a modern homage to ancient gladiatorial pits. Armed with only small daggers and their bare-hands, the two titans went at it like demi-gods fighting for the fate of the mortal world. However, only one could come out on top, so who shall win this deadly and final duel?"

First to receive this blessing was his right-hand man General Douglas MacArthur, who took exceptionally well to the FEV due to being a prime normal, turning into a massive Super Mutant of unmatched size and still-normal levels of intelligence. Not reduced to near-mindless goons like Hoover’s earlier test subjects, the old general has been redubbed simply as Mac, and shall now serve as the head Lieutenant of the Master’s Armies. With the rest of Mac’s men undergoing the same metamorphosis as he did, with less spectacular results, the Master shall soon have an endless and unstoppable army of pure Super Mutants - the absolute pinnacle of evolution."

Though most would have predicted that such a move would have killed Tlaloc, it would seem that the opposite has become true, for the rapid decay that was causing Tlaloc's demise in the other world has now been entirely stopped, perhaps forever! With Tlaloc now occupying all of southern Mexico, the two AIs are now locked in a Mexican Standoff of their own, with the destiny of all of Central American and perhaps the world hanging in the balance."
